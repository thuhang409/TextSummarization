candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price i was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me ,home delivered , great product
my husband is a twizzlers addict we have bought these many times from amazon because we are government employees living overseas and cannot get them in the country we are to they have always been fresh and tasty packed well and arrive in a timely manner ,always fresh , great taste
i can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality has not dropped in all these years still a superb product you will not be disappointed with ,delicious product , great product
i have lived out of the us for over yrs now and i so miss my twizzlers when i go back to visit or someone visits me i always stock up all i can say is yum br sell these in mexico and you will have a buyer more often than i am able to buy them right now ,please these in , good but not great
the candy is just red no flavor just plan and chewy i would never buy them again ,nasty no flavor , great taste
i was so glad amazon carried these batteries i have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size i need them for my garage door opener br great deal for the price ,great for the price , great for
i got this for my who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake and my father who simply to limit unnecessary sugar intake she is the one with the sweet tooth they both loved these you would never guess that they are sugar free and it is so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free i was so impressed that i have ordered some for myself w dark chocolate to take to the office so i will eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets br these are just excellent ,yummy , great taste
i do not know if it is the or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind we picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away when we realized that we simply could not find it anywhere in our city we were bummed br br now because of the magic of the internet we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it br br if you love hot sauce i mean really love hot sauce but do not want a sauce that burns your throat grab a bottle of tequila gourmet de just realize that once you taste it you will never want to use any other sauce br br thank you for the personal incredible service ,the best hot sauce in the world , best hot cocoa i have ever had
i have never been a huge coffee fan however my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the latte no coffee shop has a better one and i like most of the other products too as a usually non coffee drinker br the little machine is super easy to use and a really good coffee latte cappuccino etc in less than a minute if water is heated up i would recommend the gusto to anyone too good for the price and i am getting one myself ,great machine , not as good as i be
this offer is a great price and a great taste thanks amazon for selling this product br br ,this is my taste , great
oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation still the mccann is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal it is even better than the organic all natural brands i have tried all the varieties in the mccann variety pack taste good it can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue br br mccann use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff one thing i do not like though is mccann use of oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy tasty oatmeal without the need for gum but this is a convenience product maybe the gum is why after sitting in the bowl a while the instant mccann becomes too thick and gluey ,best of the instant , great product
this is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand it uses cane sugar instead of high corn syrup so not only does it have a better sweetness but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you great on a cold morning when you do not have time to make mccann steel cut oats the apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too plus they do not require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart ,good instant , not as good as it is
instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl mccann instant oatmeal holds its texture has excellent flavor and is good for you all at the same time mccann regular oat meal is excellent too but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning this is the best instant brand i have ever eaten and a very close second to the non instant variety br br mccann instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apples cinnamon and maple brown sugar count boxes pack of ,great oatmeal for those in a , great product
mccann instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apples cinnamon and maple brown sugar count boxes pack of br br i m a fan of the mccann steel cut oats so i thought i would give the instant variety a try i found it to be a meal not too sweet and great for folks like me post surgery who need food that is palatable easily digestible with fiber but will not make you ,satisfying , great taste
for those of us with celiac disease this product is a and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store i love mccann instant oatmeal all flavors br br thanks br ,love gluten free oatmeal , good but not great
what else do you need to know oatmeal instant make it with a half cup of low fat milk and add raisins for seconds more expensive than kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something it is still just oatmeal mmm convenient ,it is oatmeal , great product
i was visiting my friend the other morning for coffee he came out of his storage room with a packet of instant irish oatmeal he suggested that i try it for my own use in my stash sometimes dose not give you a chance to say no so i ended up trying the apple and found it to be very when made with water or powdered milk it goes good with o j and coffee and a slice of toast and your ready to take on the world or the day at least ,good way to start the day , great coffee
i ordered this for my wife as it was by our daughter she has this almost every morning and likes all flavors she is happy i am happy br a href http www amazon com gp product b eo mccann instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apples cinnamon and maple brown sugar count boxes pack of a ,wife favorite breakfast , great product
the variety packs taste great br br i have them every morning at cents per meal i do not understand why everyone on earth is not buying this stuff up br br maple and brown sugar is terrific followed by apples and cinnamon followed by regular you do not get tired of the same ole thing and they taste great br br i just boil water from a small pot empty the packet or in a bowl pour in boiling water and watch it expand to x its size br br taste really good and takes minutes to prepare br br not sure why everyone on earth is not this convenient healthy very quick excellent quality and extremely cheap ,why would not you buy oatmeal from tastes great , great product
as giving you a chance to experience the difference between mccann and other well known what i personally like about mccann is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in america the apples cinnamon though tends to be a little so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add in my microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty seven seconds so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use br the only bad thing if you can consider it a bad thing about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you will end up with six ten count boxes this is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal eaters but if you are a single person alone well love oatmeal ,oatmeal for oatmeal lovers , good product but
i have mccann oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from amazon i am able to save almost per box br it is a great product tastes great and very healthy ,food great , great product
mccann oatmeal is a good quality choice our favorite is the apples and cinnamon but we find that none of these are overly sugary for a good hot breakfast in minutes this is excellent ,good hot breakfast , great taste
we really like the mccann steel cut oats but find we do not cook it up too often br this tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient br anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing ,great taste and , good but not great
this seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands but it is somewhat mushy and does not have quite as much flavor either it did not pass with my kids so i probably will not buy it again ,oatmeal , good
good oatmeal i like the apple cinnamon the best though i would not follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too for my taste that could just be me since i like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of ,good , not as good as it is
the flavors are good however i do not see any between this and oats brand they are both mushy ,mushy , good but not great
i really like the maple and brown sugar flavor the regular is fine with brown sugar added the apples and cinnamon flavor is ok this is a very quick easy and satisfying breakfast and i will order this brand again but not the variety i will get all maple and brown sugar ,very good but time i will not order the variety pack , not as good as it is
this is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores there is nothing healthy about it it is just carbs and sugars save your money and get something that at least has some taste ,same stuff , not as good as it is
this oatmeal is not good its mushy soft i do not like it quaker oats is the way to go ,do not like it , good
got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix i bought from the seller and the advertising worked lol i tried them and shared them with buddies and we all loved them so im here to buy more and noticed there were no reviews yet well now there is they are hot but not burn your mouth forever hot its a nice temp perfect for us ,hot and good came back for more , great taste
under your arms it requires a beverage as advertised a glass of very cold milk and a box of since it will make your nose run they look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work i suspect that some people have been my goodies in my absence especially my i am going to take this to work at opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary peanuts can and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when i return br br the can should be to ensure the spices are evenly distributed it is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes br br you ll go nuts over these ass peanuts br br p s i am not sharing the peanuts not deliberately and i will probably give the jaw for christmas he will be so ,you will go nuts over , not as good as i be
we are used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy doubt very much habanero is used at all could take it up a notch or two ,not , not as good as it
i roast at home with a stove top popcorn popper but i do it outside of course these beans coffee bean direct green mexican seem to be well for this method the first and second cracks are distinct and i have roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time the aroma is strong and the taste is smooth yet ,up a smooth brew , good stuff
we roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill about of the bag at a time the smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too more importantly the coffee is smooth no bitter aftertaste on numerous occasions we have had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much ,our love it , great taste
deal was awesome arrived before halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or i love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store candy ,awesome deal , great product
it is chocolate what can i say great variety of everything our family loves with a family of six it goes fast here perfect variety kit take five and more ,how can you go wrong , great taste
great product nice combination of chocolates and perfect size the bags had plenty and they were shipped promptly the kids in the neighborhood liked our candies ,awsome kids in loved us , great taste
halloween is over but i sent a bag to my daughters class for her share the chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many ,great deal , great taste
watch your prices with this while the assortment was good and i did get this on a gold box purchase the price for this was br less at target ,better price for this at , good
this bag of candy online is pretty expensive it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores other than that its a good combination of my favorite candy ,pretty expensive , great product
arrived in days and were so stale i could not eat any of the bags ,stale product , good
powder form long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my water heavily laced with the powder not overly tasty but quite effective as i never got a on these several hundred mile rides same for desert in the the were always laced with the powder now we have the fizz what a great product its hammer product so it is great athlete the world over use their products second its convenient tablets that in a fizz third it tastes great imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a salty taste you get a refreshing lemon lime or mango the always get the fizz now i also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever i exercise and have a nice flavored water full of electrolytes i cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough ,nutrition rocks , best of the best
this product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride br i have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor no after taste and i actually like the slight carbonation br i use other hammer products and really like their whole product line ,great of , not as good as
this stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides pop into each water bottle and you are set flavor is fine and goes down easy ,great for , great product
for those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing br br two years ago i started again after many years but was having heart after longer rides in high heat i was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue gatorade was not an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so i looked around for a low carb alternative the zero carb sports drinks did not help so what to do one day i ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them voila problem solved br br i ve shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these br br these guys got it right they are formulated and simply work ,low carb alternative to , not as good as i be
i purchased the mango flavor and to me it does not take like mango at all there is no hint of sweetness and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice i have been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades so i am familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products i have tried the mango flavor is one of the least appealing i have tasted it is not terrible but it is bad enough that i notice the bad taste every sip i take ,taste is not so good , not as good as it is
if you are like me then is ok do not get me wrong the quality of these babies is very good and i have no complaints but in the price is a little ridiculous esp when you add on the shipping ,how much would you for a bag of chocolate , not as good as it is
these gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality the bears even have little faces at my local candy store this type of gummi stuff bears rings balls worms whatever are about lb these twin packs of or pound bags is a screaming deal as far as i am concerned i am probably pounds deep in these things consumed ,great , great product
grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area in fact pretty much anyone i talk to about grape gummy bears they think i am lying so i bought lbs these bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick but nothing to strong i love grape flavored candy soda and these are pretty good there is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion but these are well worth it for the price i like to use the gummy bears in home made with flavored sports drink the salt in the sports drink makes for softer and the gummy bears are awesome frozen they are delicious ,then other brands , not as good as i be
i ordered two of these and two of raspberry tarts directly from website for a dinner party i was it arrived fresh and intact very good size i half for later use i am a pastry lover and these were the best i have ever tasted the pastry was soft the jam was really good and the taste was great they were gone in no time my guests were really impressed ,best ever tart , good but not great
sweetener could be the all symptoms were gone when i stopped eating the chocolate my it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when i purchased some delicious sugar free popcorn at my local market the taste was amazing and while i was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy new sugarfree treat taste so good my heart when i followed the little next to sugarfree sweetener down to the very bottom of the label and read maltitol in tiny little letters thank goodness i would eaten only a little i still ended up with all the same side effects but for a much some people can use maltitol to their heart content but others like me can have a bad reaction to it in case you are like me it is not you it the maltitol ,warning warning , not as good as i be
it is okay i would not go out of my way to buy it again ,nothing special , not as good as
no tea flavor at all just whole of flavors it is not returnable i wasted bucks ,no tea flavor , not as good as it
these looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix unfortunately they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate i left them in my pantry for a few days and when i opened them at room temperature they were still gooey i through them in the fridge and i have been breaking off ever since they taste good to me but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then again i will not order them online again but if i see them in a store i would pick them up ,good , good for you
these taste really good i have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture i agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer there is no packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items order in cold weather and buy enough to last ,taste great , good but not great
the taste was great but the berries had melted may order again in winter if you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor ,order only in cold , not as good as
i know i cannot make tea this good granted i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet it tastes crisp ,this is the best , great tea
this peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat my dad got me one for christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when i was a little girl i am now and i love it ,delicious , delicious
great gift for all ages i purchased these giant before and the loved them so much they kept them and would not eat them ,great , great product
to the bottom let it settle for a bit before opening the top though br br this stuff tastes way better than the creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors i am going to try using some essential oils next and see if i can get a good chocolate orange mix br br all of the ingredients i mentioned are here online take the time to experiment maybe you do not use any low fat milk or do not add any flavorings it is up to you also would make great host gifts br br i am sure other people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it and i am sure i will experiment with it in cooking but the main reason i bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great ,this stuff a coffee , a great product
while my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food for some reason their itching increased when i tried the lamb and rice i have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help the duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again i like natural balance for the quality ingredients ,natural balance lamb and rice , my dog loves these
awesome dog food however when given to my boston who has severe reactions to some food ingredients his itching increased to jumping out of bed at night scratching as soon as i changed to a different formula the scratching stopped so glad natural balance has other choices i guess you have to try each until you find what is best for your pet ,my dogs , my dog loves it
we have three dogs and all of them love this food we bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him no more hot spots or tummy problems br i love that it ships right to our door with free shipping ,great food , my dog loves them
my dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food she was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has after we got the test back we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand so i finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this she still has her environmental but i am happy she can finally eat something i know will not cause her pain ,great for my dogs allergies , my dog loves them
my shepherd mix has ibs our vet recommended a limited ingredient food this has really helped her symptoms and she likes it i will always buy it from amazon it cheaper and free shipping ,great for stomach problems , great product
natural balance dry dog food lamb meal and brown rice recipe did wonders for my jack russell she has awful food allergy and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that did not have something in it that she was allergic to she has no problem eating it dry but normally i mix the natural balance dry lamb and brown rice with the natural balance wet lamb and brown rice she seems to like that better we started feeding it to our other dog a too and she loves it if your dog has allergy or stomach issue or if you want your dog to eat better food this is it you will see a difference in your pet ,better life for you dog , my dog loves them
great food i love the idea of one food for all ages breeds t a real convenience as well as a really good product my dogs eat less have almost no gas their poop is regular and a perfect consistency what else can a mom ask for ,great food , my dog loves them
i have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food i have switched them to a different food due to price a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance ,great food for my my dog who has a sensitive stomach , great product
this is great dog food my dog has allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him ,great dog food , dog loves it
this food is great all ages dogs i have a year old and a puppy they are both so soft and hardly ever get sick the food is good especially when you have amazon prime shipping ,mmmmm mmmmm good , my dog loves these
balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties i mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it furthermore i do like mixing up the flavors each time as i think the same meal day over day might get a little boring so i figured why not i tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells br br additionally i started purchasing off amazon because petco did not have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans i came home and to my surprise realized that i could save each time i bought dog food if i just buy it off amazon br br all in all i definitely recommend and give my of approval to natural balance dog food while i have never eaten it my dog seems to love it ,great dog food , great dog food
this is the same food we get at pet store but it is delivered to my door and for the same price or slightly less ,so convenient , great product
i have been very pleased with the natural balance dog food our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and i had someone recommend natural balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains since switching i have not had any issues it is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger smaller sized dogs ,good healthy dog food , my dog loves them
food he is been noticeably healthier and more energetic since i switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year despite the higher cost of natural dog foods i find that he eats significantly less of the natural balance dog foods and still stays happy and full on the normal dog foods he would eat up to cups of dog food a day the recommended serving for his size whereas he only eats about cup to cup of the natural balance dog food a day when you take this into account you are actually getting more bang for your buck with the natural dog foods since you do not have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods and a healthier happier dog to boot add in the fact that you can get free day shipping with amazon prime i am sold ,great dog food , my dog loves it
our pup has experienced allergies in forms of and itching from other dog foods the cheap you can buy it anywhere food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets this food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food br this message is approved ,great allergy sensitive dog food dogs love it , great product
my english had skin allergies the summer we got him at age the vet recommended we him off the food his previous owner gave him iams lamb and rice and onto a new kind this was the second one we tried and it has been working ever since it is for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food like chicken or beef ,perfect for our english with allergies , my dog loves these
i fed this to my golden retriever and he hated it he would not eat it and when he did it gave him terrible diarrhea we will not be buying this again it is also super expensive ,bad , great product
the mouth says how do i love let me count the ways br if you like apple products a must have item the only draw back shipping cost these are very heavy ,taste it is a star item , great product
arrived slightly my parents would not accept it however the company was very helpful and a full refund ,great , great product
the crust on these tarts are perfect my husband loves these but i am not so crazy about them they are just too sour tart for my taste i will eat the crust and hubby takes my filling my kids think they are great so maybe it is just me ,tart , good
what a nice alternative to an apple pie love the fact there was no slicing and easy to prepare i also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed ,loved these , great taste
i like creme brulee i loved that these were so easy just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and they look amazing and taste great my guess thought i really went out of the way for them when really it took all of minutes i will be ordering more ,the best , great taste
not what i was expecting in terms of the company reputation for excellent home delivery products ,disappointing , not as good as it is
i first bought pickled asparagus at an amish market and it was love at first bite hence when i saw these on the discount rack at the local safeway i cleaned it out these are even better than the ones from the amish market they are fantastic and some of the jars have a bonus of garlic at the bottom i am going to order the six pack and i am a household of one they wont go to waste ,vinegar on a is a , not as good as it is
i am presently on a diet and i was at my fresh and easy neighborhood grocery looking over possible diet foods i wanted things that were tasty non fat and low in calories i came home with about a dozen items that is how i discovered the farms pickled crispy asparagus well i have always liked asparagus anyway and i have enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus this farms brand is really really good it is the best i can recall there is an excellent flavor and a big of garlic down in the bottom of the jar which i am looking forward to eating i cannot believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says only calories per jar now this is my idea of a good diet food br br gary peterson ,my idea of a good diet food , delicious and healthy
i was in the flavor and texture of this mix i usually like most of the low carb things i have tried but was in this specific one ,low carb food , great taste
i have been drinking this tea for a long time now i used to have to purchase it at a doctor office because it was not available elsewhere i am so glad that i can buy it now from amazon com i drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee wonderful taste ,delicious tea , great tea
farms raw honey to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too i also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea tribute hu long but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea although i would if i could afford it br br cons on my latest shipment the package shown on the amazon page is different than the one shipped the one shipped naturally high in a key to the possible health effects of tea whereas the amazon package free so i am not sure if this green tea is free or not the other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when i the string from around the tea bag so if the string seems stuck to the tea bag i put the bag in the hot water to it ,my every day green tea , not as good as i
this has to be one of the best teas i have ever tasted it is clean bright fresh br br great delivery again quality just try it ,the best tea ever clean , great product
i love love this green tea it is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and i usually do not get as many boxes as i did with this merchant i will definitely order from this seller again thanks i depend on my green tea fix everyday ,tea review , great tea

i am italian and i lived in italy for years i used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an italian espresso i could not find them anywhere here in the bay area so it is great to have them again ,great cookies , great snack
in the s i spent several summers in italy this biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid day snack they are simple and delicious and were not sold in the us back then they are so good that i brought back two bags from a recent trip to italy it is great to see that they may now be found on amazon br br note it is great to open a bag smell the contents pour a glass of milk then dip the in the milk great routine and treat for kids ,best cookie , great product
alternatives that are out there marketed as being healthy why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal is that right i will stay with this for now but stay br br i m this review after months of using this cat food for our two cats i upgraded the stars from to as it really has been a good food for the two of them still eats a little too much but he is just a big cat who does not exercise much let us face it our female cat will be years old in a couple months and she is so healthy she is tiny but happy and i tried the chicken version of holistic select but to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one i have ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it ,so far so good , cat cat cat food
i started buying this after i noticed my year old cat was already starting to lose his so i decided it was time to start buying him real cat food not the garbage in the super markets i found this at the pet store out of the other million choices and i am sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one i went with to try first and it was a great purchase my cat has been on this for the past months and he is now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft mainly he loved the taste even more i highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals ,best cat food , cat cat food
i have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat and this is an excellent food that is also according to my holistic veterinarian they put probiotics on the kibble as the last step which is very important to me the best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and i had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat holistic select ,great food , great product
this cat food was recommended by my vet because my year old cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was weight it stopped her problems she does not eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price it aids in digestion since the ok sorry smells are gone if ya know what i mean had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of from this cat food ,perfect cat food for cats , cat cat food
i have a year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections i feed him this dry food in combination with wet food with water added to it and ease the combination seems to keeps his under control if i switch to another type of dry food his gets worse the other cats seem to enjoy this food as well it is expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me ,good for , my cat loves it
before i was about feline nutrition i allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food i always offered both canned and dry but wish i would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food i have two year old cats and two year old cats the only good quality dry foods they will eat are wellness and innova innova manufacturer was recently purchased by i began looking for a replacement after once again offering several samples from my local holistic pet store holistic select was the only one other than the usual wellness and innova they would eat for finicky cats i recommend trying holistic select it is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters ,and healthy , cat cat food
my holistic vet recommended this along with a few other brands we tried them all but my cats prefer this especially the sardine version the best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear and and i do not want to be rude so i will say this as as i can their waste is far less than cats who eat the mcdonalds junk found in most stores which is a definite plus for me the health benefits are so obvious i highly recommend holistic select ,healthy they love it , my cat loves it
one of my cats is allergic to fish and beef this formula is one of the few she can eat and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet both of my kitties are very active have soft shiny fur and neither are fat dry food tartar on teeth also ,wonderful food perfect for , cat food
our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food they definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great they are fit and not over weight this vendor ships extremely fast is one of the top amazon in our book ,cat food , cat cat food
i have been a fan of hot spicy ramen for a long time if you enjoy spice and love ramen you will love this product too bad it is way too expensive here on amazon it is only per at my walmart ,tastes great love hot spicy bad price here , great taste
i have been eating ramen noodles since i was a little kid and i have never found a better flavor than hot spicy chicken it is not hot at all to a like me but it sure is good ,my favorite , good stuff
i love spicy ramen but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation does not go away for like hours not sure if that is healthy or not and you can buy this at walmart for way cheaper than amazon ,it , not as good as it is
always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in ,amazing to the last bite , great product
i must be a bit of a because this soup tastes to me how i imagine fire might taste typically i like spicy food if it has a good flavor i do not find this to be the case with this soup any flavor is killed off by the burn ,not for me , not as good as it is
i really loved the spicy flavor these had i found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite if you are not used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough ,great spicy flavor , good stuff
got these on sale for roughly cents per cup which is half the price of my local grocery stores plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors these things are a great snack for my office where time is constantly and sometimes you cannot escape for a real meal this is one of my favorite flavors of instant lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale ,great value and convenient , good for you
i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon ,great flavor , great taste
i love this flavor of ramen i do not eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison for the convenience of having it delivered to my home i have prime so i get it in two days and do not have to pay for the shipping the price on amazon is not bad at all but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store ,tastes great but is cheaper , great taste
the best i have ever made for ginger it is unbelievable it is like the real ginger has that spicy kick to it but it is perfect with the sugar it down it is very worth the for lbs of it i will be getting more soon i use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies ,tastes awesome looks beautiful , great taste
delicious i cannot get ginger where i live this compares to ginger i have purchased in other now i can enjoy it without traveling ,happy , delicious
i keep trying other brands cheaper brands stupid me this ginger is soooo worth the money tender moist and never a let down ,simply the best , best ever
my son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and i automatically ordered it for him i was really not expecting any better results than the other things we have tried what a surprise he has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day of starting eating one piece of this ginger each morning he can now eat anything and actually enjoy it this product was a god send for him thank you all for it ,excellent product life saver , great product
i bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on because it is bite size it is easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick my only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping ,nice snack , the best
twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand br if you can get these for to a package with free s h it is a good deal br the black and cherry have good taste but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there ,good licorice , delicious
i love these very tasty i think i am addicted to them br buying them in packs of bags is very reasonable than going to target and getting a bag savings are about a a bag i use subscribe and save on these and several other product i love subscribe and save ,i love these , delicious
if you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children then be sure to try these they are soft easy to chew and they do not get your hands all sticky and gross in the car in the summer at the beach etc we love all the and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack great item great price too highly recommend ,great for the kids , great for
i might be mistaken but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size if they did do that it was done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal having so many pieces after all the problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience as it is you have to use or pieces to match the old piece size it is not the same ,bite , not as good as it is
being a fan of newman pineapple salsa for quite a while i was looking for a comparable salsa this is one of the best tasting salsas i have ever had my daughters love it too they do not like super chunky salsa and the berry mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces the salsa is not too sweet just sweet enough and although it is mild it has a nice little kick to it at this price it is a steal ,sweet with a nice , a little juice
it probably was but unfortunately the person at amazon that is a there is probably several had very little stuffing to work with especially on the therefore the were broken on all three bottles as i for my computer i was told no returns cause it is a food item i then looked for a customer service tag and i found none on their new face lift they seem to be proud of their new face lift but they should at least have a place to contact them in emergencies like i buy a lot of stuff and it all comes in styrofoam boxes never would i ship things br especially salsa in a cardboard box with just a of large bubble wrap on it no matter how much the fed is careful it is going to break somewhere along the line especially in an all glass container l s ,broken , not as good as it is
this is one of the best salsas that i have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack the other two that come with it are not worth your money ,love the salsa , great product
this is the best i made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding also fried some oysters with this meal it gave them a great texture and ,awesome , best ever
this is a fabulous marinade i love to use it for chicken either baked in the oven or on the grill this has enough flavor i have even used it for dinner parties only to receive rave reviews from my guests definitely worth the price super cheap and super easy love it ,great , great product
works with chicken fish beef or pork fast easy and makes it taste excellent plus buying in bulk is more than off from box stores ,awesome stuff , great product
got this for my brother who is on diet and decided to try one for myself it actually tastes pretty good ,tastes good , good but not great
these singles sell for at the store for box of singles i am not sure why amazon is selling it for for a box of singles hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite but truly this is not a good buy ,off price , great product
awesome such a yummy flavor i got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and i am so glad that i did there are so many things you can do with jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you i will be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful ,o , great taste
i went to grocery stores looking for this flavor of jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here this jello is wonderful it is only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the fall i could not find it anywhere in town this jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe i made with it takes like watermelon jam great made as regular jello too yummy ,great flavor of o , great product
what a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use this box should last our family the year no problem iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will ,great deal , great taste
perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket we love it shakes well no clumping and ,great tasting sea salt with , great snack
span class tiny length mins br br span the expiration date is months from the day i bought this product the tuna tomato combination is delicious this is one of the many items i re order on amazon every month or so br edit added a short video so you see what this combination looks like br br i was one of those but i did not do a good job on the tuna br i should film it over but it does not look like many people view this product anyway ,tastes very fresh , not as good as it is
i have never heard of the brand before but i was tired of only trying the typical pouches and chicken of the sea i was really surprised as i thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning ,simple but good , good but not great
these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion make a great on the go snack and really satisfying with the tomato ,tasty , delicious
i have always purchased star tuna but thought i would try this brand for a change of pace the taste of the tuna was not pleasant too much basil and other spices for me ,not the greatest tasting , not as good as it is
i am not familiar with the brand but being a tuna addict gave this a shot the tuna tastes like it is good quality but i found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland it is better than something plain but it did not pack the punch i was hoping for it is still a great option for a low calorie low fat meal ,not bad , not as good as it is
i found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there excellent quality and no need to it up br br i put it the micro on about power for minute and br br i believe a little heating brings out the flavor ,right size taste , not as good as it is
seriously this product was as tasteless as they come there are much better tasting products out there but at calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack you just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor ,tasteless but low calorie , not as good as it is
i read about pomegranate molasses so i had to try it i have not made anything with it yet just eaten a little bit at a time but wow is it decadent it is dark syrupy sour and a little sweet a dab of this and i forget about dessert it is just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone yum i am going to try making next ,this stuff is good , not as good as it is
used this in recipes as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water wonderful wonderful stuff ,best stuff ever , best stuff ever
i do not know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere but they were so old that they would not cook i had to throw half of them out because the skins were damaged a clear sign of dried beans past their prime i cannot even return these or ask for a refund because food is not returnable will find a different brand to use for now i have about fifty servings of beans to throw away ,very low quality , not as good as it is
besides being smaller than they look the same and have the same consistency unfortunately they taste nothing like banana nor do they even taste good yucky stuff trying to return with vendor ,not banana , not as good as
the item over all was fine but the banana heads are not just like banana they are alot smaller also when i received the item the packaging was not great the banana heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope ,banana not banana , not as good as
i purchased as a for a baby shower with theme they worked out perfect for small bags of candy i purchased if you want more than small bags i would purchase a larger bag ,worked great , great product
i have drunk since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine i love this stuff in milk br it much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk i am french and live in the us br and bring back boxes of at every opportunity is another hidden you can bring br back check it out ,forever , great coffee
i first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in france and thought it was delicious i wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that i love this product ,delicious , great product
cinnamon coffee cake really takes the cake with size price quality and taste br the cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition it also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top before serving i could not believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of for us to enjoy during breakfast for three days the cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling the flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake the icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor pair the cake with your morning coffee and you have got the perfect breakfast treat ,soft delicious and sweet , not as good as i be
i used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about years ago this stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going it feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong the stronger it is the less you use as well the product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost i thought these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad this is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth sensation it used to be like ,great but not as good as it was back in the day as a , great product
one of the best lemon juice that i have tried i am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product when the season for fresh is out this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or br br i will continue buying it ,excellent lemon juice , great product
this lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year round it has a powerful flavor and you do not need much of it to zest up a dish i add a of it to my water nearly every day br br i will buy this product again and again ,great product , great taste
fast delivery and good product this is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it is really handy to have around to add to sauces dressings etc such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it having the lemons on hand to begin with ,handy , great product
this is not as good as the frozen lemon juice but it is good it has a slightly odd flavor perhaps from a preservative sure wish i could order the frozen juice ,juice from amazon , not as good as it is
could not believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was seriously drink it only if you are getting ready for a or bedtime if you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended br br i feel my arms and legs almost with relaxation after a short time my eyes start to get and i am in another place br br love this stuff ,almost like something you , not as good as it is
i bought these at grocery outlet here in the seattle are for a case of not paying yes for a dollar i like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this out price ,never that much , not as good as it is
this is an great product the taste is great and it works exactly as described superb natural sleep aid amazing ,mellow half tea half , great taste
us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule yes we would probably be better served taking a class but this is a good second choice this helps you fall asleep and stay asleep i drank half the first night and that was plenty for me after about minutes i was ready for bed i up refreshed and with no sleepy drug so that is a huge bonus br br i gave the product stars instead of the it deserves as their packing job was at best the product arrived with broken bottles which at this price is a loss the bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box big packing fail but the product is awesome ,great product to help you , great product
we made chocolate chip cookies with garbanzo bean flour and the results were fantastic the brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned our friends could not discern any difference from classic the texture body and meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten free flours is nice and chewy the same as made with regular flour and an added bonus the high protein and fiber level i g fiber cookie fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower br br i highly recommend this flour even if are the only thing you make with it ,perfect for gluten free chocolate chip cookies , great taste
this is great stuff made some really tasty banana bread good quality and lowest price in town ,bean flour , great product
we had trouble finding this locally delivery was fast no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores ,yum , great product
tarts in a muffin pan pre baking each mold with a layer of pie crust even commercial crust works though again i prefer pate it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better just blind bake the muffin tins lined with pate then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits berries are great and pour over the glaze some people put a layer of creme which is a pastry cream like custard but with flour below the fruit and i happen to think these taste best br br if you get into baking this glaze is a must have on the shelf the ingredients are vegan tapioca starch carrageenan dextrose cream of tartar bean gum so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake you can use this on top as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base ,make a fresh fruit tart light and beautiful , not as good as i be
my were full of hot spots and when i used this within a week all the hot spots were gone the smell is kinda strong but not bad it is ,miracle , great taste
i bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the and has the organic mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants i did not expect it to taste good but it actually does i have only had it for a few days and for its totally worth it my sisters all take but now i am them to this less expensive similar coffee i will follow up on this product in a few weeks ,not bad for instant healthy coffee , not as good as it is
the coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright and are better i bought this to try something other than these two but i probably will not get this again there is just a slight taste but it is not overwhelming it is also a bit pricey for what you get ,it is ok , not as good as i have
this coffee is great because it is all organic ingredients no pesticides to worry about plus it tastes good and you have the healing effects for ,i love it , great coffee
like the other people mentioned this coffee has a great taste i have tried different instant coffees before but this one is one of the better ones another one of my favorites if you want to try it out though not organic is pure instant coffee ,great taste and has health , great coffee
tastes great and gives me energy without the jitters love this product br however i do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip lock pouch because the zip lock ripped off and quit working after awhile but the product is fantastic just not crazy about the packaging ,tastes great arrived in days , great product
these little guys are tasty and refreshing br br i usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath i eat of these after lunch because they are so small and i find this the problem br br they re sugar free sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow which is great and they are tasty enough that i almost think of them as part of my lunch br br this is a good bulk value buy and i would highly recommend the mints themselves cheers ,great for after lunch , great taste
i like these better than the regular altoids but they are even more costly so you would better like them ,nice little but pricey , good but not great
these little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great deal there for on the go fifty mints per tin is just the right amount to along and there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugar the price of twelve dollars was very also there great for if you are looking for a mint try these ones be glad you did ,mini , great taste
these mints are really strong and have a great taste they are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse ,tasty , great
this is a huge supply of them i am still working on these and have plenty to spare much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or every time you want a mint ,these are awesome , great taste
i love and use the empty containers for medicine in my purse desk also line with felt to keep perfect little size to disguise small when traveling and love the mints tiny and powerful without burning my mouth ,love these and , great product
i find someone who keeps coming back for more i just give them their own tin one co worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as and safety pin boxes like i said a real hit since i would not be able to keep my hands off a candy dish this is a good alternative to have around and it is nice to have them around if i have garlic for lunch i gave the item stars because they are not as tasty as the sugar version of the mints but what sugar free item is as good as it is full sugar and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove although i totally get why they wrap it it still does not make it easy to deal with ,a huge hit at the , not as good as i like
the tiny altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability it is full but compact br br i have not run out yet and probably will not for a couple months but i cannot wait to buy it again ,love em they are great , great snack
i loved these wintergreen so much i had to come write a review the packaging is small for convenience and the altoids are smaller as well with a square shape blue and even more delicious taste in my opinion i definitely prefer them over the regular size altoids and will continue purchasing them highly recommended ,love these , great product
fresh scent and taste easy to eat one tin in few hours i use them as favors and everyone loved them ,fresh , great taste
hard to find the wintergreen sugar free as stores only have the red peppermint such a common flavor the wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious driving cross country if someone cuts me off i turn to my daughter with my hand out and say wintergreen me she one out puts it in my hand and all is right with the world ,me , the best
to me these are nothing like the regular altoids and are not breath mints they are pleasant tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin and that is as far as it goes the is just not strong and the are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis i am not a dragon breath person but still one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath four or five will freshen my breath for a short while maybe minutes at this point i think the mints are the best as sugar free breath mints ,these just do not do it for me as , not as good as it is
love after a certain age we were by the vet to consider senior foods and lower carb foods because the were we tried a few types of food some no change some made the litter super some had too small a kibble and the cats it up because they did not have to chew it to swallow it br br this felidae has done the trick no problems to speak of it is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose the cats love it the kibble is sized appropriate to chewing and here is the br after feeding the cats felidae their improved their coats are super soft and both are new we can directly attribute to this food we are now loyal felidae consumers br br additionally the absence of corn product in the feed seems to or remove the reactions of our friends with cat allergies ,better than average more expensive than average , great product
i started my cat on felidae platinum about weeks ago and she loves it she is an older cat somewhat overweight and had a i first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which she ate the felidae and left the old food she is now been on just the felidae for about ten days now off the old food entirely and she is a much sweeter happier cat i think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested or something in any case i am a happy of felidae i do not agree with the previous reviewer that cats do not like it clearly mine does ,my cat loves it , cat cat food
that we would give it a try for our cats i would had them on low ash purina one urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no problems br br buster the youngest is still a blob after six months plus on felidae for senior and overweight cats however the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really feeling better since we changed their food to felidae even the ancient one has started to play and the dogs by getting them to chase her where before when she was on purina one all she wanted to do was to sleep br br i think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems it will be more effective br br however the will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life ,great for fat cats and , my cat loves it
too much of a good thing we worked this kibble in over time slowly the percentage of felidae to national junk food brand until the bowl was all natural by this time the cats could not keep it in or down what a mess we have moved on ,the cats , cat cat food
food making their dogs sick right away we changed the cats food and they started down and have not suffered one bit like our dogs have br br cats are animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it we have rescued and fixed cats none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula br br i urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer website and also the fda website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal as with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals and tell me not to buy it this is just horrible ,changed formula makes cats sick , cat cat food
do not buy just a few of these i order these by the case i cannot even remember the first time i tasted an stuffed olive but i have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite ,best by the , great product
i order these olives a lot they are un like any other olives out there the subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses one of my favorite treats for guests ,looking for a different flavor , good
hey the description says grams that is roughly ounces at under per can no way that is the price for a gram can ,price cannot be , not as good as
but not by too much br br i gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it is versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it you take a plastic bag a couple of tbs of vegetable oil cup water and mix the seasoning water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for minutes in the meantime it says to stir fry your veggies peppers and onion but i found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and i do not think it affected quality or taste i also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil br br i have one more package of this to use and next time i am going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more ,more hot spicy than brand , not as good as it is
a friend who d been drinking tea for of his years introduced me to this tea a few months ago even took me over to the store and bought me a pound at lb in a retail store or a little over with shipping from an online merchant i think it is great i have been drinking earl grey english breakfast irish breakfast assam etc most of them were over lb with shipping aside from the i think this is a great replacement for all the rest has everything i am looking for in a strong full bodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring my current favorite afternoon tea unless you are extremely or a tea snob you will love it ,loose blend tea is great for the price , great tea
i love strong full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam irish breakfast or early grey tea but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be so i have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that was not bitter at a more palatable price point and this certainly fits the bill and unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another i e iced vs hot this tea is excellent in both forms i would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that does not cost an arm and leg ,nice tea , great tea
i drink this tea plain without sugar or milk and it has a pleasant aroma br br the price from amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store one reviewer is right i think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma so the label blend kind of the herb br br i am not exactly a black tea drinker so this tea is a surprise and affordable too i usually prefer white chinese tea like white but it is more expensive and requires lower temperature water but this is black tea and this aroma kind of remind me the of white tea ,a fragrant tea , not as good as i have
i have tried a variety of ahmad tea not because i particularly like this brand but they are just easier to come across the blend i believe is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones i have tried it is full body like a good cup of assam which by no means overpower the delightful clean taste of complete with a long lasting note of bergamot i enjoy it best in the evening it gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day br br for those interested in the specifics i use about teaspoons of lose tea in a steel in a oz mug let it steep in f water for min take the out and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its ,best tea , great tea
i have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the russian custom of preparing and drinking tea and the ahmad blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced i buy the three packs as needed from amazon and go through them rapidly my family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too try one box of it and you will love it too ,my favorite tea , great product
this is an excellent tea one of the best i have ever had it is especially great when you prepare it with a ,best tea ever , great tea

is like a regular cracker which is not bad except that i bought them because i wanted a cheese taste br br what was a huge disappointment how misleading the packaging of the box is the photo on the box i bought these in store makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads expanding the length and of the box wrong the plastic tray that holds the crackers is about smaller all around leaving you with about or so small flatbreads br br what is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco friendly packaging fail they used a huge box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers not at all br br would i buy these again no i feel ripped off the other crackers like sesame give you a little br more bang for your buck and have more flavor ,taste is is , not as good as i like
this is the ultimate puppy food the kibbles are great for small breeds high in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use less waste results from the high quality ingredients i have been hunting training showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly years with multiple national i have been highly satisfied with eukanuba quality and the results i have obtained feeding their foods my recent purchases are with through amazon com their prices are the best i have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock ,puppy small dog food , my dog loves it
mean they loved the food do not get me wrong and they loved it more when we would mix in some water and it would be like soft food somehow that made their gas worse but i think i will have to give that responsible to the speed with which they down cannot blame the food itself for br br eventually we switched their food no more i think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies they just need that in their diet i think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful they said up until year yeah right you try dealing with gas for that long around mos of age we switched to much better granted they do not like it as much but we humans like it a whole lot better ,high quality but it gave my dog , my dog loves them

if you like the tea variety you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea br br i am so happy to find ahmad teas available here thanks amazon and very surprised at the negative review from because in the years we have been drinking ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed the superb quality of ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years br br the current deal for the pack of is very good cheaper than i can find locally br br highly recommended br br note this listing description is confusing each packet of tea weighs grams which equals pounds or ounces ,excellent loose tea , great tea
i have been enjoying this tea for years this tea is good mornings afternoons or evenings my local store went out of thanks amazon i use a tea press to prepare a pot ,good anytime hot tea , great tea
hi i have to have black tea everyday i have done it in the past years and it is a habit of mine ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and i highly recommend it if you like black tea i think this is going to remain my favorite for the next years or so ,my cup of tea , great tea
i have tried it out despite the other review and i found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either russian or italian groceries ,this is what you get in the store , great tea
ahmad tea is an excellent tea hot or for making iced tea great flavor with no lingering aftertaste ,tea , great tea
i have been drinking this tea for the past or years usually buying a box or two when visiting large areas where many middle eastern stores carry loose ahmad teas usually at for a pound box i have always considered it an but robust tea with enough aroma and taste and beautiful reddish color perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own but a decent base for mixes br this tea however is nothing of the sort freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell and the brewed tea is weak flat and tasteless somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore so you get a lot of tea for the money but the quality is such that you might as well drink lipton bags they are not that much worse ,disappointed , great tea
i love love love this deal it is way fun to pick from so many teas and chocolates and as well as many coffees the other that assemble are boring they do the choosing and from a much range the sellers here are very nice also and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method it easy if you want great packaging forget it they ship fast and the kups are just tossed loose in a box who cares ,wonderful , great product

wow this product is very impressive i bought the oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging price and shipping the powder dissolves instantly even in water i have just been mixing a tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great but will add it to my smoothies and fruit juices next this product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries especially because there is no waste due to mold or berries thrown away i think you could add this to baked or foods as well i am excited to add more of the to my diet in this fast and easy way i definitely will being trying the other flavors soon ,super are super easy , not as good as it is
i am chemical sensitive as well as sugar free i have been using this product for over a year i use it maybe once a week at the most i drink the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how i feel imo this does not replace my a m coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when i start to fade once in a while i drink a full bottle before a workout i have been drinking guayaki yerba mate teas for years compared to the many toxic energy out there i highly recommend this this product is clean and does not leave nasty behind in the body try it before you judge from a review everyone body reacts differently ,best energy for me , great product
i felt energized within five minutes but it lasted for about minutes i paid for this drink i could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money ,do not waste your money , not as good as it is
a good buy either i definitely feel an energy boost w full guayaki shot but not w out all the other caffeine side effects mood caffeine is why i stopped drinking coffee but it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe br br now you are not sensitive to caffeine then it is a great buy it is not loaded w sugar the taste is easy and pleasant it is not loaded w a bunch of chemicals like hour shots or starbucks drinks and the energy boost lasts for about to hours takes about to minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body weight br br side note if you want to feel energized during the day have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy ,if you cannot this is not for you , not bad but not great
these nature valley nut lovers variety pack was perfect although i was not sure about the peanut butter bar it was excellent i loved the roasted almond roasted pecan and the peanut butter br br i will definately buy from this seller again quick shipping and very fresh ,yum yummy , great product
i so wish i would have read this review before purchasing two gallons of this oil for my health issues it like a chemical rubber smell this smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid when i called to report the situation to the company told me i would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab unbelievable good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund including shipping the product is faulty period i will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ,like , good but not great
this product has a strong after taste of crayons br br i am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes upon opening the plastic container the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room and this flavor the food that is cooked in it br br i suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as i have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased br br to date my favorite coconut oil is distributed by the flavor is fantastic however they do not supply a gallon sized tub and dr has the best product in that size category ,disappointed , not as good as it is
had this shipped to my sister who follows a gluten free eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish also uses it in place of bread crumbs in and meatballs stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking too good product good value ,great for gluten free , great for gluten free
these are healthy and my mixed terrier adores them and they are healthy and his breath does not smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products a great healthy product ,my dog loves these , great for
a great healthy chew for my old beagle he loves the taste and it sure beats my arm ,yummy , great snack
i really enjoy this product i had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store once i found it i look no further it is the only sugar i use thanks so much ,sugar in the raw , great product
really liked about sugar in the raw it enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes i called their to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar they have had many complaints of a similar nature this they claimed also reduced the crystal size they said this problem should go away with their newer crop the representative said that the new crop sugar will have a date code without any that ends with a and no letters the are a date code using the my recent bad purchase had a space after the initial of numbers and then ended with a a bottom line their current product is not much better than much cheaper products when they get a better crop i will go back to purchasing sugar in the raw ,problems product , not as good as i be
sugar in the raw tm please harvest cane w o burning br to be delivered to s br dear sugar in the raw folks br br we who buy your product care about the environment and we would like to know that you care too when you burn the cane fields on maui it adds to the co and climate change and the smoke from your burning is damaging the of your workers your workers children and the of maui br br we love your product and want you to change to no burn so we can continue to buy it knowing we are not contributing to warming and disease br br ,good product but terrible , not as good as it is
love this sugar i also get sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar recommend ,sugar in the raw , great taste
product is exactly as advertised what a savings at least half the retail price easy to store because of the individual packaging ,sugar in the raw , great product
it is just sugar in the raw it is flavor profile is much better then white sugar and it is suppose to be better for you or something i just wish the bags were resealable ,it is sugar , not as good as it is
this is a delicious sugar it has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma but the granules are quite big however bigger than plain refined sugar this makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together but if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it it is a great product it would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer ,excellent but not perfect , delicious
i only use raw sugar it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good will buy again ,good product , great product
this sugar is very good use this in your coffee cereal etc for a week and you will never go back to white sugar white sugar will taste terrible plus from what i have read this raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our diets br br the product was delivered fast and well packaged my only complaint is the price i wish i could find raw sugar cheaper i would be happy to buy in bulk but this is the cheapest i have found ,you will never use white sugar again , best coffee ever
i thought this was a great buy but as noted by d the molasses content was not up to par i loved the higher molasses content sugar in the raw unfortunately what i purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and i have twelve ounce bags i guess i will watch for the next crop ,thanks for the review , great product
i really love this sugar and price wise it is much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else ,great , great taste
love this sugar it tastes so much better and is not as overly sweet tasting as regular sugar we have used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good the price that amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff ,awesome sugar , great product
cannot say anything bad about sugar in the raw i like it better than the other natural sugars better consistency and i know it does not matter but better color unfortunately one of the natural paper bags got torn a bit in the box it did not look like the box was damaged so i cannot tell how it happened but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when i opened it not sure what the solution is and i would order it again but if it happens again i would switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag ,great product weak packaging , not as good as it is
great service items arrived faster than expected very efficient will use this seller again i highly recommend this seller thank you for the excellent service ,excellent , great product
please ignore the one star comments if you check the bag the main ingredient is in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower with anything that is gluten free you have to add another which is where the corn flour comes in for someone who has celiac disease and cannot have because they contain wheat a key to any chip cookie or cereal this is an excellent product my and i buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious ,excellent for g , great for
best flavor ever i am addicted they are all good but these are by far the best i could live on these and there is no need for anymore to say ,amazing , great taste
so many healthy products do not taste very good or taste good when you first try them and then go i have had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty i have served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them it is also nice to have something gluten free for friends who are diabetic but i would eat them anyway ,very tasty chips , great chips
i found these crisps at our local walmart figured i would give them a try they were so yummy i may never go back to regular chips not that i was a big chip fan anyway the only problem is i can eat the entire bag in one sitting i give these crisps a big thumbs up ,yummy , great taste
this is one of the best tasting crisps i have ever eaten i only buy it on special because i know i will eat the whole bag ,excellent taste , delicious
i paid for a ounce pkg of these at lunch today i bought them because brown rice is a good carb as soon as i tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip i checked the ingredients the name is deceptive these have masa corn flour listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste i will not buy these again i can get for less money and similar taste ,over priced chips and rice taste , good but not great
and in a hurry this stuff makes it so much easier ever notice that some canned have a weird tin can taste when you make sauce or whatever for some reason this product does not have that it tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans heat and eat br br or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup i also make indian dishes with this and spicey spaghetti sauce i also prefer this to most canned salsas so it works for things like if you drain the liquid off br br none of my local grocery stores carry it at all nor do they carry anything like it so i have to pay amazon inflated price to order this by the case i do not like that i am paying a higher price but i love love love the product ,me on a daily , a great product
the price on this product certainly my attention on amazon price with the local stores i can get a can of this at my local kroger for ,it is fabulous but not from amazon , great product
y all br br the actual product is very good i would rate the item a on it is own however it is only one dollar at the local grocery and twenty eight dollars per twelve pack these are running almost two and a half dollars each br br as i said too expensive sigh i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost br br take care br lee ,too expensive , not as good as it is
nothing wrong with the product but i sure had to mix it with lots of other ingredients to make it edible to me in texas i was called a baby mouth not into very spicy hot foods br br for comparison i am comfortable with medium chunky salsa can of this milder mixed with slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips i used some of this to make a sort of cornbread that was good though ,not mild enough for me , great product
taste is not the greatest but it is a oz shot and it is gone in a second it tastes more or less like a concentrated sweet tea for the record i have had hour energy and that tastes far worse i will put up the taste for the results it is got mg of caffeine which is the equivalent of the big red and i cannot stand sucralose and sugar substitutes and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it the sugar is at g which is not horrible i used to drink oz red a day for the caffeine and this gives me far better energy and is much more subtle my preference is black coffee but i cannot drink cups a day anymore overall steaz does it right real organic ingredients in moderate amounts and they create big results ,great natural energy , a great product
i have to get up really early to work out before work and i get super tired by the middle of the afternoon i was drinking one hour energy usually extra strength each day it worked well but gave me a jittery feeling almost but not quite my husband got me to try this and i was skeptical but for me it works as well if not better than the hour energy and does not give me that jittery almost headache feeling br br i do not mind the taste it reminds me of the inside of a fig newton mmm and the price is ok on amazon anyway at my grocery store they were almost each br br and it is organic so i can feel good about it right it is all about me feeling good ,i like this stuff , not as good as it is
i bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there he takes one in the mornings and works hard all day good stuff ,great energy , great
i am a energy and i am not sure if this works or not but what i do know is that the taste is not the greatest i do drink the steaz energy drink and i think i get the same results i like this products because it is more natural then the others ,not sure , not as good as it is
if you want an organic energy shot your choices are this one from steaz and the assorted flavors from guayaki guayaki yerba mate is actually in the steaz energy shot and energy drinks and they both use acai so there are some in ingredients br br great energy burst for hours on a steaz energy shot and no or headaches afterwards plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work this will help me cut down on my iced coffees which are not helping my calorie intake br br already ordering packs on subscribe and save per month great value ,the best energy out there smooth and organic , great product
i was looking for a natural energy shot that works and i found it steaz energy shot is my favorite br br i recently had surgery so tons of sugar is a no no and i am also allergic to sucralose splenda so most other energy drinks are out br br i tried energy shots and they did not work as well as steaz and definitely did not taste as well these have a taste that is almost like coca cola not bad at all br br if you are looking for natural energy give these a try ,fantastic natural energy , not as good as it is
energy shots and i do not like the taste of either of them this one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better i like them cold for sure my husband and i take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we do not have to make stops for coffee especially on the where it is just way too expensive it is worth the per shot we normally split them i am really sensitive to caffeine even the natural kind so i get a little weird if i drink the whole thing but that is the same for coffee too for me my husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost i would recommend these over any of the shots out there you can feel good about putting this in your body i will be ordering again soon for sure ,way better than , good but not great
i purchased it because it was on sale in terms of the energy it provides it works but the taste leaves something to be desired i tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable ,does not taste that good but you the energy , not as good as it is
i have been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon as a software this is entirely unacceptable so i asked the nice lady at the counter of my local whole foods market for something that will give me that extra energy i need to get through the day br br she returned with a suspicious little green bottle over three hours after drinking whatever that was my brain is still working at unnatural to my experiences i believe this works br br she did explain that i needed to drink plenty of water with it which i personally feel helped the energy level so if you are feeling tired during the day and hate coffee give this a shot preferably before you eat anything br br ,in a , not as good as it is
the energy shot truly does work it had a terrible after taste at first but now that i know what to expect i am getting used to it i always have some water handy as a chaser which helps i am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy i need without all the chemicals found in other beverages it is helped me kick my addiction to diet coke and other aspartame laced caffeinated beverages yay ,this stuff works , not as good as it is
i have tried hour energy red rain and other energy shots this is my favorite in terms of taste and effect plus it is somewhat to know that natural ingredients are used sometimes i wonder what i am really putting into my body with some of the other brands i purchase a box about once every months for the past years ,favorite energy and all natural too , best ever
if you are looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals this is a great option the taste is decent and it is a nice smooth without jitters ,natural energy boost , great product
the drink is delicious i can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea i am very sensitive to sucralose splenda which is in so many energy drinks these days i also hate the taste i love that steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners the rush it gives me is slow and even i have several medical conditions including which me of energy and causes intense pain i like how steaz helps clear away the and so i can get things done no caffeine jitters even though there are mg of caffeine in each bottle br it was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores so i started looking online for a bulk price i am so thrilled to have found the pack of on amazon i signed up for amazon prime specifically for this product ,best energy i have ever tasted , i love it
i have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all its also the best taste others taste like medicine this one has a tea fresh taste i love it ,the best , best tea ever
i drive over the road truck and this helps to keep me alert it has no sugar high no crash i am on a which i like the price is very good i have seen it over bucks in the store ,by a , good but not great
products takes pretty good and it does not leave you with and save as well as prime membership i pay below a shot my wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style i moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training i recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an awesome energy drink ,good stuff , great product
i use this product daily and it provides a steady stream of energy i do not get jittery or crash it also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite ,great energy drink without artificial ingredients , great product
i have been buying and drinking this for over a year now and the energy boost is excellent with a hour effect the most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well or perhaps i am getting more used to it i do not drink it for the flavor but it is not as as the fake flavors found in the other non organic energy shots ,flavor getting better energy is great , not as good as it is
this is the first time i have really been by other reviews on amazon i like energy i find rain ok and so i thought i would try this product based on the reviews boy am i sorry i gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose really and it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards tic tacs at once did not get rid of it but worst of all within an hour i was and unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea flavored cough syrup and do not work do not buy this i do not know what to do with the other bottles big fail ,so awful i can barely , not as good as it is
i loved this mold i wished i could have used it for more than one occasion but it did not last i did use it to make suckers for my daughter first birthday but there was going to be no way that the mold could be after that i would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions but for the price it did not matter to me that much it served it is main purpose ,could use only once , great taste
you have to try the vanilla tootsie rolls the regular chocolate ones are good but these are the best ever ,vanilla , good
try this you might like it i did and i am quite addicted it is too easy to prepare it tastes great and it the flavors you cook it with the price is really good and well worth the purchase if you like this type of couscous like i do then give this one a try it can be eaten hot room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed i cooked the couscous with a broth and oil for added flavor and it my taste buds big time i will be back for more ,one of my foods , not as good as i be
this color couscous is really good full of flavor and fun to eat i love the texture i cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs parsley cilantro along with some red pepper flakes at the end of cooking i add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dish highly recommend ,fantastic , great product
i tried to find couscous in a number of grocery stores and no luck so i decided to try good ole amazon com and this product it is so good add a few herbs and it is a great side dish or add more and make a pasta type salad so very good i am hooked great flavor and so easy to prepare ,wow , great product
the package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions i know how i normally cook couscous so tried cup water to cup couscous brought to a boil and let sit covered for min it was mushy and tasteless we have thrown out the rest of the container ,very , not as good as it is
i would not even think of buying this product unless i know the price per unit how can i compare other items online or in a store ,what is it , great product
i love ordering whole bean coffee on amazon i like this so much that this my first product review i have to say that i am usually not a big fan of flavored coffee but i thought i would give it a try when my husband started grinding it up i could smell it throughout the house sometimes with flavored coffees the smell is there but the taste isn t however not with this one i am now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try ,very good coffee , good coffee but not a great price
i love this coffee i do wish it came already ground as i do not have a grinder and use a blender instead but it is worth it many flavored coffees i have tried only seem to have a flavored odor that does not reach the coffee but this one manages both ,very tasty , great coffee
this brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time i have believe the company is local i have been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it i am particularly fond of the but all the flavors are good i cannot say that i have had a bad one br br as it turns out it is less expensive to order it from amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local walmart to get it it is a no brainer try it if you like rich flavored coffee you will like it ,excellent coffee , good coffee
it is hot i love it tasty and a little sweet i usually at salsas labeled as hot but this one lives up to its ,hot , great hot chocolate
a corn chip dip it is hot but after awhile the medium salsa was too mild for me i thought maybe i would cut down how much i ate by going to the hot salsa it is hot enough that people who are not used to it will say that is hot br br flavor bright and forward the similarly hot salsa victoria is a taste to me i guess earthy this salsa is much brighter in the mouth i do not like to go hotter than this because the sauces i have tried lose any to yummy salsa and just taste hot this happens to me with tabasco sauce for example br br a drawback is la victoria does not make a larger bottle of salsa nor salsa victoria nor do they sell them in or sam club to get a good deal you have to watch for sales ,hot and delicious , great product
use frequently as we like to do asian dishes at least once a week love this product fast shipping as usual would buy again ,sauce , great product
these individually wrapped pieces are delicious although i wish there were a few more mildly sweet with no sugar free aftertaste even a traditional should enjoy these ,absolutely delicious , great product
put this in my husbands stocking for christmas and it was a hit ,great gift , great product
i was amazed at how quickly it arrived it is a cute stocking stuffer but only ok as far as user appeal you get what you pay for ,arrived fast , not as good as
so we cancelled the order it was cancelled without any problem that is a positive note ,never arrived , great product
i love the convenience of the singles the best creamer around taste is just like the big bottle i can stick them in my purse and take them to work ,coffee coffee hazelnut , great product
these creamers come in packs of i have taken one to work and opened one for home so far and have not found a single broken or leaking creamer yet i usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because i will not allow myself more than creamers per cup i think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping ,no broken , great taste
even though we are international delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product we had no problem with the shipment but the creamer itself is thinner than international delight other than that we are happy d ,shipped great , great product
had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to packaging br br that was not an issue here the shipment arrived in four boxes of each as shown in the photo those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good before damaging the inner boxes thus none of my cups were broken no waste and no mess plus the four boxes means i could put one in the kitchen one in the bathroom we moved our mini keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen keurig best idea my husband ever had and one at work with a reserve for runs out first br br if you are looking for these mini creamers but like i was by the negative packaging reviews on other options this is your best bet as a bonus the auto delivery price is very reasonable ,better packaging , i like it

bought a set of two when my son was about months and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat i cut up apple banana even used sweet potatoes a few times just whatever i could get at the restaurant and it would keep my son busy long enough that i could actually eat it is great because i did not have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks and he got to try out new foods i would not hesitate to buy this again ,love love love these , great product
i have a slightly different version of this different brand my son started using it around six months and he really enjoys it he does get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon but whatever anyway i also had trouble cleaning it until i tried it with a nail or vegetable brush that works pretty well it takes some time but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender or cut it up then clean it up off him the chair the floor the dog me well you get the picture ,great for eating whole foods clean with , great product
what a great idea my daughter love it br i do not think is difficult to wash i mean is not like just toss water and that is it but come on br absolutely recommend it ,absolutely love it , great product

i loved this product for fruits and other food that i did not want my new baby to choke on i also used it to put ice in when my baby was it worked great for this as well as for the food i did not like bananas in it though impossible to get clean ,great for , great product
i love love love the idea of this product and my little one loves loves loves to use it she gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and i do not have to worry about her choking the only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the and are impossible to get out granted some foods are more difficult than others and some do not cause that much of a problem bananas however have pretty much a couple of them while i love this product i think that next time i will get the one that has the and mesh bags ,wonderful idea to clean , great product
the fresh food is an okay product it is kind of like sucking on food through a while my daughter was interested in it for a little while she eventually lost interest i may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts ,i was not that impressed , not as good as it is
this product is amazing i know a few people with little ones that use these and they love them super easy to clean and use when ordering these i was under the impression that there were per package fyi they re not only one per ,love the fresh food , great for

i have purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix which is a great product by the way this is the highest price i have seen whole foods carries this item and it is been on sale there for that canadian dollars too as i am in canada it is even cheaper on baker box own website and they are the company selling this product through amazon for a two pack they should be charging or less what gives i thought amazon was where you could find competitive prices ,the product is great but the price is out of line , great product
the sugar was sweet that can not be as advertised it did not melt when baked either however it will not do for your waffles what the larger of belgian pearl will do these grains are smaller think pretzel salt or seed pearls ,is not the same as , not as good as it is

this is what i was looking for and was missing it the taste is exactly the taste as the one made in india so just loved it and remember my days back in india definitely recommend it ,great taste , not as good as it is
i bought this strawberry extract hoping to up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than i would original expected a common problem in some fruit wines br br this is indeed good strawberry flavor just add to your sugary concoction be it a baking good a dessert or a drink to either give strawberry flavor or add to flavor and presto just about everyone will be licking their lips and maybe fingers br br for those interested i found the right addition to a liquid volume to be oz of extract per gallon of liquid ,taste by a wine , not as good as it is
great stuff and dependable especially when there are a million brands out there to choose from i love the stuff for really high end i go with the olive oils from california but i buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again ,excellent olive oil , great product
i had not tried or heard of till recently weavers not it is my favorite i am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and have not found one yet they are all so smooth no bite no after taste a little pricy but still worth it no worse price wise than starbucks or peets will keep running through the list here and see what happens love them all so far ,love i am a fan , great taste
having always been a strict peet coffee lover i was to switch brands but weaver won my heart the taste is clean and strong the is correct organic baby and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate be still my caffeinated heart ,make my day , great coffee
go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of weaver organic whole bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee and when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they do not know better take along a travel mug filled with weaver coffee from home and enjoy a real cup of joe er weaver ,treat to the best coffee , great coffee
a very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and or honey definately not my cup of coffee oh did i say it was bitter ,bitter , good coffee
im learning that american and south american coffees have this distinct coffee finish as a peets coffee we learned that weavers roaster was the roaster for peet and we are hooked i already the french and organic blend but i must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drink br met the weavers team at the brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast since them we are fans br you wont be dissapointed ,it now love the aroma , great coffee
i like eating these whenever i need an energy boost br it has everything that i am searching for in a to go snack br fiber plus chocolate is never a bad thing ,great snack , great product
these are my favorite bars ever the combo of and dark choc is wonderful very filling these are hard to find in the stores i am thankful for and save ,best bar , great taste
my loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us do not carry them anymore once again amazon came through and he could not be happier ,cannot find anywhere else , great taste
i was buying quaker oats granola bars but these nature valley chewy bars are better tasting they make a great snack when i am on the go chocolate peanuts and raisins it does not get any better ,my new bar , great snack
hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school he takes two bars now and is very happy to do so it is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores so again amazon com came through with a reasonable price now i came keep the husband breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings i often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack ,another husband favorite , great product
nantucket blend coffee is one of my favorites i was suprised that it was a single box every time i ordered before it was a pack my fault for not reading closer i will not order any more at this price for count ,price surprise , great coffee
green mountain nantucket blend k cups make a very good cup of coffee in my a href http www amazon com gp product b keurig b b elite gourmet single cup home brewing system a this is a very smooth tasting brew that my wife prefers over the a href http www amazon com gp product b coffee people donut shop k cups for keurig brewers pack of amazon frustration free packaging a i generally drink in the morning br br these are good on both small and large cup settings as well br br highly recommended br br cfh ,very smooth coffee highly recommended , good coffee but not a great price
blend pods almost all in all this is a very standard cup of coffee which while it is not anything new or exciting is very pleasing and definitely one of the better keurig options we have been able to test out when we run out of all the pods we have i will probably pick up a box of these as well br br now that i know green mountain is not completely disappointing i will definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees with our promotion for getting the we ordered a href http www amazon com gp product b i y ie green mountain coffee golden french toast k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers count a to try as well and see how it goes from there br br if you are looking for a go to choice this is your cup ,a for green coffee , good coffee but not a great price
green mountain is my favorite brand nantucket is my favorite coffee from green mountain very smooth flavor not too strong and not too weak ,my favorite , good coffee
i was looking for a replacement for timothy kona blend which is no longer carried on amazon this coffee from green mountain is very nice but not strong enough for me if you like milder coffees then this one is for you ,good coffee , good coffee
one of green best blends of coffee in my opinion love it for your everyday blend perfect excellent blend ,blend k cups , good coffee
this is just fantastic chicken noodle soup the best i have ever eaten with large hearty chunks of chicken and vegetables and nice large noodles this soup is just so full bodied and is seasoned just right i am so glad amazon carries this product i just cannot find it here in vermont ,fantastic chicken soup , best ever
i have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking i love the regular i use it on everything you will not be sorry you tired it great for dipping bread and cooking and green beans ,greatest oil bread , great product
oh my gosh is this good like most people i have been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it then hubby brought a jar of this home the tomato flavor is amazing i will never buy store ketchup every again ,best ever , not as good as it is
did a great job of the classic ketchup with this wonderful product the refreshed taste of this ketchup is a great update and now leaves me disappointed when i am given heinz while out at a restaurant br br for you heinz die hard fans out there this is not the ketchup for you but for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in heinz be sure to give this ketchup a try br br don t forget the spiced variety purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first experience is definitely the way to go ,scrumptious , not as good as it is
this is ridiculous the best gourmet ketchup i have ever tasted it is pricey but wow love this stuff it would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup yummy ,no more , best ever
the tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor it is clean and really fresh perfect on an chicken sandwich br br the spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup i have ever tried it is so good i have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy ,this is really good stuff , best ever
the spicy version of this ketchup is not bad but it is too expensive the regular version is sweet as dessert horrible annie organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less even heinz organic is a better deal i gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass not plastic ,disappointing , not as good as it is
these are overpriced and terrible the classic is sweet the spiced tastes like a bad spicy sauce from a chain restaurant ,waste of money , great taste
i have been using mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years the roland extra fancy that i purchased from you are the best that i have ever used including the mushrooms that i bought in italy and back to the usa ,an excellent product , great product
italy nothing was as to the proportion from each country br br i m quite fond of dried mushrooms while they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus additionally i find the broth used to re hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews to save time and add flavor i sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re hydrating them really helps all the flavors together i also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta the pasta up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom infused water br br this was the first time i used the roland brand got it on a price dip from the amazon warehouse and would certainly buy them again highly recommend ,excellent flavor pieces , not as good as it is
if you are a peanut lover these are for you much larger than cocktail peanuts six people on my christmas gift list ask for these every year ,the best , great
the cashews were nice and big with the vast majority being whole there were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag but that is pretty expected with so many cashews they made an absolutely excellent cashew brittle br br my order took just over a week to arrive which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country they came double bagged in clear plastic bags and in two lb portions this was highly convenient since i could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until i was ready to work with it br br great value for the price ,good for the money , not as good as it is
although there were several ones they taste just fine i mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they do not have to look perfect anyways for the price they are a great deal about half of what i find them for in the store ,not the quality but good for the price , not as good as it is
i ordered these after a fair bit of searching online even ordering the smaller oz bags i will admit i was a bit when i ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good or bad the cashews would be br br the order came in pretty fast like days the cashews were fresh and whole with like broken pieces they were in lb bags sealed with clear tape first i found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal considering the second pack stayed fresh till i opened them the trick is to actually keep them in an air tight box so that they stay fresh longer br br the only negative i can think of is that the price went up for the lb since i bought them ,fresh whole perfect , not as good as i be
these nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty they are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can ,fresh and tasty , good
i bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that i have at a couple of restaurants plus he likes nuts pecans almonds peanuts he loved these i actually ordered cans instead of the gift tin so he could take one to work or his place and stay fresh longer although i do not think freshness will be an issue they will not last long lol ,gift winner , good but not great
my cat will go for a day probably longer have not it but he will walk right by this stuff every time even when i know he is absolutely no interest i swear he would rather die of then even take a of it ,cat will not go it , cat grass
got this free with another order i placed i could not believe how much the cats loved it i will buy again for sure ,simply wild brown rice for cats , great product
this is a great ham soup base i have used it in ham and beans and seasoned great flavor ,base , great product
i have not used the ham base it is loaded with msg i did not realize this when i ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item ,msg base , not as good as it is
before i discover this mix on amazon i always bought it in whole food store br i like this mix and when i am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy br just one small secret try to add the seltzer water instead of regular one ,pancakes , great product
i appreciate the fact that i can buy this product online and have free shipping this is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture thanks again amazon ,a great all around mix , great product
arrowhead mills buttermilk pancake mix is my favorite mix it tastes great cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make although it can be made using water i think it is better made with milk i love it with pure organic maple syrup ,great mix , great for a great price
the pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my son egg allergy it is also great for camping or any time you would like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available ,perfect mix for , great for gluten free

we are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergy br they taste fine for our family we like them many ways ,good for allergy , great product
i love the flour however amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess customer took care of the problem however it was a way to ship the product ,love the product disappointed in the shipping , great product
this mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box bags out of had come at the top there were no tears in the packages ,poor item packaging , great product
just awful i thought food was supposed to taste good i had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth it is that bad ,awful , not as good as it is
perhaps the worst bottle of wine i have ever had i am not even sure i would cook with this it is thin no body and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot the taste is just bitter not the complexity that i expect from a pinot noir of any price just not what i am looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir maybe my bottle was not sealed well and went to vinegar other reviews for this wine are favorable ,disappointing , not as good as it is
a good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition everyone get the munchies is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips ,great healthy snack , great snack
this is a wonderful warm flavored tea especially now in colder weather br this tea has a sweet soothing chamomile fragrance it is subtle and sweet it one of the better chamomile teas br if you find it hard to sleep at times a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help br if you really like sweet taste try bigelow chamomile mango herbal tea br i highly recommend both ,sweet and , not as good as i like
this is one of the best mint chocolate syrup i have ever had so far the others pale in flavor by comparison there are only seven ingredients in this sauce including organic natural mint flavor in the past i used ice cream heavy with other flavors like chocolate chips oreo cookies caramel al because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale now i buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the organic mint chocolate syrup really stands out but does not overpower the flavor of the ice cream there are only calories and because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste i use it sparingly so this oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups i used ,flavor , great chips
this is a simple product and it is simply good there are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you the internet finding out what they are it is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out this will be great for people who like mint it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate i use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half tastes great sometimes simple is better ,ingredients about to read , good but not great
a item delicious fish with the ultimate flavor best ever in a can for all purposes i sent a case to my mother recently diagnosed with diabetes and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties ,a fantastic healthy product , great taste
i ordered this product at the same time as the kirkland signature salmon the trading co salmon is very tasty equally as good quality salmon as the kirkland however the arrived in perfect condition the kirkland cans were dented badly i recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon ,great product , great product
this tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an indian restaurant it is much better than getting a teabag and making it the english way with a lot of water and a bit of milk this is very creamy and tasty my only criticism is that there are not enough sachets in the box only since the directions say that you use one for ml of water approximately half a cup it is not enough for a good cup of tea so i use two that means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea but it is a delicious after dinner drink i would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box ,excellent tea , great tea
i love this product cant find it locally sometimes little out of the way stores have it but i also love the chicken pork bags every store i go in i look for them the i found it was at a meat market ,french roast n bags , great product
this is the best way to cook a roast our local grocery went out of and so i could not find this product till i looked here please continue to keep this product available ,best roast ever , best ever
it is always a pleasure to find french products on the web all of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but bland and tasteless seasonings br br this is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find ,is the best , not as good as it is
if you like oreo or the oreo then you have got to try the double stuff cakesters these are the best side note shipping was very slow but maybe your chances will be better ,the , good but not great
i was surprised about how good this was my family and friends when i told them i bought this but out of the can ready mix with a little salt pepper spinach and some cheese and it is a great easy meal ,very good great taste and easy for a single , great taste
the thing about marmite is that those who do not like it hate it and those who love it cannot live without it it is very much an english thing and the language has even adopted the trade name as a as in victoria is marmite meaning that those who do not like her etc amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price last time i looked it was a g jar in british stores in l a or about x what it costs in england the amazon supplier was quick and efficient and i now have enough marmite to last me to the end of the year or would have if i did not decide to send one of the two jars to my son in japan good job amazon ,an taste , i love it
a miserable pancake i put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried i do not know if it was their flat and appearance or their salty bitter taste only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix the buttermilk baking soda and sea salt are not i am going back to nature buttermilk pancake mix this one went straight into the garbage ,look for your whole , great for the price
these arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap the cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery store br br i have no complaints but i also now have no more cookies we ate them all ,these are for a , good for you
i was not expecting to like these cookies as much as i do i like chocolate chip cookies well enough but i really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones i have to say these famous cookies have much turned me around the cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients the chips are real chocolate and melt in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing these are truly great cookies ,wow , good but not great
they are not fattening and they are good for you right that is what i heard at least from an person ,i love these cookies , great taste
great if you are cutting back on fat they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them extremely dry and hard ,hard , great chips
i have never met a kettle brand chip i did not like these chips have a great loaded potato flavor which are flavorful i like the sweet onion chips better but these are also at the top of the list for great tasting potato chips kettle chips are great chips f the money ,kettle potato chips baked potato , great chips
after buying bags one at a time at a hefty at nearby stores i decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on amazon i was very pleased with the price and the products br br these jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy they have a slow building spice that starts very a grows if you eat the whole bag which i am embarrassed to say i did quite a few times br br the chips arrived well packed and fresh they had nearly a year of time before they expired which is pretty impressive for chips br br most importantly the price per bag was much much better than any local store could do although i live near an expensive city so that may play a in the price difference br br i would not hesitate to order another box of these once i run out ,fresh lightly crunchy kettle chips good value good product , the best chips i have ever had
i buy mostly for vending so the size of the bag is important kettle oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full salt vinegar flavor is satisfying about an out of ,glad to find them in oz size , not as good as it is
glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full it is hard to find single serving chip bags that well sometimes they are too wide or too plump with air bag size is good bbq flavor is about an out of ,pretty good could be better , good but not great
one of the best chips that you can buy and i have tried all the kettle varieties and many others there is only a slight taste of jalapeno and they are delicious perfect with a sandwich or alone br if you like being addicted these are the chip for you see you at ,a taste of , great chips
the title says it all great flavor hint of spice excellent crunch we eat kettle chips by the truck load at my house we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite never enough bags to get us to our next shipment i just wish amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save if you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself ,best chips ever , great chips
wow i have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day kettle chips are the best non baked chips i have eaten i decided to try the sweet onion chips since i have never had them i now have a favorite if you like onions this is a must buy i will definitely reorder these as i mentioned above they are the best i have ever eaten the flavor is great ,kettle potato chips sweet onion , delicious and healthy chips
are frying the chips in i love that these are not filled with nasty chemicals i ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but i was torn between the a href http www amazon com gp product b kettle brand potato chips fully loaded baked potato ounce pack of a and the jalapeno flavor while i know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better they include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which i am fine with since i have a vegetarian i ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and i cannot guarantee how many i will have left my and i love these the packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches or handing out in gift bags even just for portion control ,good , delicious and healthy chips
now i have not done a side by side comparison but these chips still taste like the real deal these snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store i work for portion control and reduced fat yes please with the subscribe save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store ,delicious , good chips
i love kettle brand chips br i ve been in love with the honey dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors br br sea salt vinegar chips are tangy sour and make my lips when i eat too many at a time i got big bags for a steal from amazon what br br personally the flavor is too much for me but my mom aunt love them and they hate potato chips ,up , delicious
these chips are thick and crunchy i absolutely love them the taste is perfect i like to buy these smaller bags because i cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good ,i love these chips they are thick and crunchy , great chips
i enjoy these chips i got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change i think those are better but only slightly like the there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering the small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag ,quite good , great chips
i love these chips i buy the pack once a month the bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags the jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor ,delicious , great chips
these are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips i have had i could still do with more vinegar flavor but i think this is as close as i am going to get without them with vinegar powder myself br br i did a side by side with the cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful additionally as other reviewers have said they have quite a good bit of potassium in them somewhere in the neighbor of rda per serving ,salty and , good chips but not as good as you are
i have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a year i love them but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favorite will be ordering them ,wow , great chips
these are my favorite gluten free dairy free flavored chips many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it is nice to find ones that i can eat the vinegar flavor is really intense and good ,best gluten free dairy free chips , delicious
these kettle brand potato chips in the spicy thai flavor really do taste like food i have eaten at a thai restaurant the ingredients listed include garlic powder onion powder parsley jalapeno and spices i am not sure what other spices there are but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me yum these chips are thick cut and very crunch they come in a seriously heavy duty bag i tried to open it like i do regular chip bags by the two sides apart no way the bag is so thick i wondered if it was plastic i started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it sure enough there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions tear here so easy why did not i think of that ,a unique flavor for fans of thai food , i love these chips
honey dijon flavor okay flavor but both my girlfriend and i thought they left a bad aftertaste the aftertaste is sort of like old cheese presumably some folks like this i am not a fancy cheese eater and it lingers for at least an hour i would give this flavor a rating of stars out of br br we have also tried the ny cheddar flavor stars which we both liked better and they did not leave any long lingering or bad aftertaste br br i d give the consistency of the chips stars the chips are crunchy but also greasy enough that i keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating kettle chips ,honey leaves bad aftertaste are pretty good , the best chips i have ever had
salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip these ones made by kettle were very tasty and i enjoyed them thoroughly i just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste ,very good , delicious
what i like about them br very thick chips br no trans fat and all natural according to the info on the bag br flavor but that is a subjective thing br oz bags which keep you from eating too much at one time just set a limit of bag br br cons br as another reviewer said there is a lot of oil in them chips what i do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off it seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off but it is true and at least this way you will get rid of some of the oil ,excellent , great chips
these are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many a handful or two does the trick very crisp and savory ,tangy goodness , good
i usually love kettle chips and love salt vinegar but these chips were way too vinegary for me they do have the typical kettle chip crunch but are too flavored for my taste ,on the vinegar , delicious
subtle flavor to them you can taste the cheddar in them but it does not you in the face like supermarket brand chips might the taste lingers as well which is a definite plus br br another aspect about these kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp that crunch in your mouth on top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags i have had since the purchase the only negative i might have is that the flavoring of the chips is some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain this is not a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and does not ruin the bag at all br br overall the quality of the chips is fantastic the flavor is great and you wont be disappointed especially if you are a cheddar lover ,a delicious crisp chip with good flavor , great chips
tried many varieties of bbq chips and hands down these are the best on the market these r not too salty or greasy great crispy crunch plenty of good bbq flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of every bag after bag is just as mouth delicious as the st ,best buy in bbq chips , great taste
kettle are the best ever these used to be my favorite flavor until i tried their salt and pepper kind but i am sure this is just a personal preference br br crunchy real potato chips ,love them , best chips ever
these chips have the right amount of crunch and i enjoy the taste chips are consistent and have a fairly even of seasoning i like the oz size bags just the right amount of chips ,crunchy and tasty , great chips
handy whenever i want because it seems frito lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items i want rather than the items frito lay wants me to have the two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the for example which i find works very well they are large enough to be a good snack on their own or you can even share a single bag over lunch the size is perfect for these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh no chip needed br br the only problem i subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones kettle chip consumption definitely have to hide the case from the kids ,at low cost , great for a great price
ok i did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful i took the plunge as i do like salty and tangy flavors no i had never had these before i took the and ordered a case at a super price they arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date umm i am in the middle on these chips they are ok but not something i cannot live without i love the crunch the color no trans fat they are a little too vinegary for my taste which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard boiled eggs and pickled feet br br i have not tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience ,an taste , not as good as i be
this was the best deal ever the delivery was fast the chips are delicious and very fresh love it ,best deal ever , great chips
my husband and i love these chips personally i think the flavor is perfect try them for yourself ,yum , great chips
i was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store but they were on sale so i bought a bag i have found that going beyond the simply flavored chips like cheddar or vinegar usually results in disappointment tried the thai or asian chips by target farms and they were awful these kettle spicy thai chips are just awesome so much so that i am considering buying them in bulk from amazon the taste is and different parts of the palate the taste prevalent in real thai food is baked into this chip sweet salty spicy was sour in there too i do not know but this is a well made well balanced chip that is addicting ,excellent thai flavored chip , not as good as i be
as a professional potato chip i see these as very best on the market rich taste and flavor almost impossible not to finish the entire bag the true meaning of decadence ,best kettle chips , best ever
these are hands down the absolute best salt vinegar chips you can buy they have a great strong flavor that has left me addicted these are certainly my favorite chips i highly recommend trying them ,the salt vinegar , great chips
oh i love these chips and they are so hard to find where i am and when i do find them they are usually more per bag for less great that these are so cheap here at amazon ,delicious as always , great chips
i love these chips it is a little weird to review potato chips but these chips are great the crunch is just right plus they have just the right amount of salt not to salty not too bland they are a little oily but that is ok the best thing is the oz package when i buy a larger bag it is harder to resist eating them all this oz package allows for a little portion control be sure to use your scissors to open because these chips are packaged for freshness and do not open easily enjoy ,yummy , great chips
in the past couple years i have eaten and reviewed several kinds and of chips from the best i have ever had to big if you have eaten the varieties there is no way that they are not the best as a group the kettle chips are salted and i was so irritated by some pringles products kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming takes away from the flavors all in all its good to have choice amazon does not stock the all the time so there are some days that there is no choice ,not quite the best , great chips
these chips are good and bad and create moral constantly if are strong at will or having a large bbq go for it but as for me i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days had to put in a lot of time on the to make up for it beware ,want to with no control buy this , great chips
kettle chips flavors can be hit or miss some of their flavors are terrible but this is very simple and delicious probably one of their best flavors br br pros thick crunchy potato chips with light salt that does not compromise on taste eco friendly business that is not just giving us lip service br br cons the occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open they have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time i end up down the entire side of the bag use scissors instead ,one of their best flavors , delicious
we bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in sonoma while we were on vacation i was not sure what to expect by the package and at first bite i did not know what to think and then all of the flavors hit br yum they are a bit spicy but nothing overpowering just lots of crunchy sweet spicy goodness they are not sold everywhere though i am still trying to find them somewhere close to where i live ,love these chips , great chips
i have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive i cannot stop eating them it is crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt just perfect believe me some chips are so salty i cannot finish a small bag but this one i just keep on eating ,highly chips , great chips
these are some of the best chips that i have ever had they sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands they are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time these will be the only chips that i buy from now on and i thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time ,these are awesome , great chips

these chips remind me of a long brand of chips we could get in middle school they are by far the tastiest chips i have had and it is impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the blue bag and then putting the bag on the bag ,these chips make me weak at the , great chips
these are by far my favorite chips they are extremely crunchy similar to other kettle style chips but it is the extreme vinegar flavor that these from lesser fried potato snacks i have tried several other brands of salt and vinegar and none of them come close ,by far my favorite chips , delicious
they are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut i much prefer the salt pepper just for the krinkle cut they have a better texture all around this brand is much better than frito lay and a good price on amazon when you get free shipping these are similar to tim or chips in that they are very crispy br br on a side note these are the hardest bags to open by hand i have to use a knife or scissors everytime ,good chips more cheese , good but not great
it took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you they sure were eaten all up by my family and friends ,pretty good tasting chip , great chips
these are delicious the oz bags are a bit big for school lunches definitely more than a serving ,yummy chips , great snack
i recently tried this flavor brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are the best thing was that there were a lot of brown chips in the my favorite so i bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends i am a little disappointed that there are not so far very many brown chips in these bags but the flavor is still very good i like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty and the onion flavor is better if you have not eaten kettle chips before i recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk they are thicker and crunchier than lays but just as fresh out of the bag ,best sour cream onion chip i have had , great chips
we are always pleased with amazon packaging chips are never crushed or broken always fresh we really liked this brand flavor of chips very tasty ,great chips , great chips
these chips are some of the best i have tasted they are not filled with chemicals you taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato not greasy perfectly crispy if you do not like salt and vinegar tanginess do not even bother to try these definitely have zip i love them my children and their friends love them even my year old loves them ,fabulous , great chips

i do not eat many chips but these i love great buy and arrived quick and packed great expiration date is a ways away so i have awhile to enjoy them great natural potato flavor i love brown russet flavor and these fit that description to a ,great chip , great chips
i simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends my experience with a lot of cheese chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side but these ny cheddar from kettle really changed my mind thanks to amazon for great discounts and i do not have to buy them from the store anymore ,excellent balance of taste and , great chips
bought this box of chips as a father day gift because dad loves them they are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips ,yum , great chips
these chips are quite tasty and the price is right packaged very well would buy again ,very good chips at a great price , great chips
i like kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked i bought a bigger sized bag from costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly so i do not know why these were different br will never buy these chips from here again ,of the chips in the bag are over , delicious
for some reason amazon would not ship these to so i sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them they are very good chips amazon should the shipping to thing i would order groceries online ,great chips , great chips
my husband likes these a lot they are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy they are more than i would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture not bad though just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health they do have about the calories in fat however ,not bad but a little hard to get used to , good chips but not as good as you are
just got this order and it is ok a bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste me if it is there ,quality chip , great taste
i really love kettle brand chips but these are rather disappointing there is very little sour cream or onion flavor ,not very creamy or , delicious
i took one and said good russet potato chip but i found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste a bit oily and overcooked it may be because i am use to eating their great tasting a href http www amazon com gp product b g q gm kettle chips spicy thai ounce bags pack of a or perhaps because all the chips in the bags i received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning it is obvious the chips are flavored but if i did not read the bag i would never have thought it had cheddar flavor and i love new york cheddar the flavoring included parmesan cheddar blue cheese garlic and other spices a good chip even when overcooked but i do not plan to buy them again ,prefer other flavors , the best chips i have ever had
i took one and said good russet potato chip but where is the flavoring then all of a sudden within seconds it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy as close to thai food as a potato chip can get these chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming the flavoring included garlic ginger jalapeno cilantro and other spices and it just felt great to eat these i will buy these again these were a treat ,these will be , great chips
i agree with the other review these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums the chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt vinegar combo unfortunately every bag i received in that case was over cooked they were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag they definitely need to improve that ,good and tangy , great chips
we love kettle chips lightly salted and do not feel guilty eating them we used to buy them at whole foods but buying from amazon has saved us money we have purchased at least times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery ,the best chips ever , great chips
a friend of mine brought these into work with the claim these will change your life while my life is fairly i cannot get enough of these chips and i do not even like kettle chips for the most part i find kettle chips to be too thick and greasy but the flavor of these chips is amazing the are the type of hot that is refreshing if you do not enjoy spicy or hot things try these anyway they may convert you ,i do not even like kettle chips and i love these , great chips
but if you happen to like me there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip i have found in this country ,you have to love sea salt and vinegar , not as good as
these are the best potato chips i have ever tasted it is easy to go through half of a bag without stopping the texture is just perfect as is the salt and vinegar combination i do not know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips i have ever had but they do and judging from the nutrition facts they seem to be healthier too they are somewhat and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c which could be because they do not skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal br br and if you like these all of the kettle chips are great ,addictive , great chips
i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them they are really amazing i love cheddar too but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor i recommend them ,amazing chips , great chips
this is easily the best potato chip that i have ever had look at the ingredients ginger and types of hot pepper how can you go wrong br br obviously not for you if you do not like spicy food but if you do like spicy food you will probably love these they have that hot with a hint of sweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of thai food ,best chip ever , delicious
chips spicy thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet savory and spicy everything you would want in a good meal or better yet a potato chip since these are kettle cooked the chips are shaped and are sometimes a bit over browned they are however sliced just perfectly not too thick not too thin so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off the flavor is tremendous although i would not describe it as thai it is more of a sweet and tangy flavor with a kick and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger if you like any spice at all these really are not overly spicy so most people can handle them the fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any snack cupboard ,tangy spicy and sweet oh my , delicious and delicious and
okay i should not eat potato chips nor should anyone br but these are so spicy i would find it hard to eat br very many that makes them an indulgence that br some people from ,an with a bite , delicious
i do not write very many reviews but i have to say that kettle brand chips are the best i have ever tasted every flavor is if you are feeling about honey dijon i would recommend cheddar beer absolutely amazing and they are healthy besides a lil fat i have eaten a lot of chips in my day and kettle takes the cake enjoy and do not eat them too fast ,the best i have had , delicious
i bought these for the office and no one can put them down i am ordering more today and it has only been weeks did not have to shop for them either amazon brought it to my door ,excellent chip , great taste
it was a great value and i like the package size but not vinegary enough for me will not order this brand again great chips otherwise ,salt and vinegar chips , great chips
perfect they are my favorite because i can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt ,delicious , great taste
amazon suggestion for a star review is i like it that being said i gave a star review to the spicy thai chips these chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip but whose taste buds do not appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor the only thing i really dislike about these chips along with the rest of the flavors is that the serving size is half the bag really who can eat half and save the rest for later not me ,i like them , great chips
these are a favorite at our home we like the ones that have sea salt we also like barbeque flavored these are not chips that have these are cut plain slice potatoes they are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth they also have a great taste the sea salt ones which are a favorite have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chips br br enjoy ,love kettle chips , great taste
these are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many they have the best potato flavor they came when you said they would ,best chips , delicious
great chips great price are that you will have them to yourself if you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar you will love these the best salt and vinegar chips i have ever had and i love this flavor mind you they are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own since i have found that s v is palatable to only the most of our species i know that my afternoon snack is all mine unless of course i run into another heavy hearty like mind summary if you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont at the sight of these bagged morsels it is the first and only time i have to a whole case of chips and i will do it again mmmmm vinegar ,so delicious yet my touch them , great chips
i was really looking forward to trying these chips since i love cheese but i was super disappointed i am a big fan of kettle chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain they are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that it annoying i do not recommend this flavor salt and vinegar and buffalo are my favorite ,love kettle chips but not this flavor , great chips
in this case chips were my favorite recently kettle brand honey dijon mustard took that so when i found out they had sour cream onion i just had to try them br br as soon as i opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk and indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful it tastes like rancid milk not just sour but like sour cream that when rancid the powdery texture is also extremely unappealing i basically hated these chips i would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular for a powdery chalky texture on a chip with a rancid and onion flavor and i have a hard time believing that person exists br br i plan on contacting kettle and sharing my thoughts with them hopefully they will the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips ,maybe the worst chips ever , the best chips i have ever had
kettle chips now look feel and taste like lays these chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty now no longer my favorite ,surprise it is different , delicious
great price for an excellent chip at about cents for a ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip everyone i have let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste i have yet to find a kettle chip that disappointed ,tasty , great taste
i love these chips which is why i bought them to stock up for the entire school year the chips taste great and packages were all sealed and in good condition when the arrived the box on the other hand was in with holes and squished i do not know if that was a result of or the but to receive it was a bit given it was falling apart luckily there were no within all the chips are as they should be ,crisp , great chips
this is the first time i tried sea salt vinegar chips not my taste make sure you like salt vinegar before ordering you may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before i will stick with the salt and black pepper chips ,vinegar not my taste , delicious
totally these chips are the best spicy chip i have ever tasted signed up for the subscribe and save option the case contained fifteen full sized bags of chips the price per unit equals per package that is not even the cost of plain chips if you add the free shipping and the fast delivery this deal is a steal so run like you something over to your computer and order the spicy thai chips p s even if you paid the going price of you are still ahead of the enjoy ,spicy thai chips , great chips
seriously now tasty tasty tasty fresh too br br the only problem is that you have a pack of and that can itself to wanting to make multiple trips to the cupboard for more or grabbing multiple bags to begin with pace yourself i keep saying br br you cannot go wrong with these if you are a fan of the salt and vinegar classic flavor br br ounce bags are about double the size of the kid bags about the same size as the ones in the small gas station it is really a good size for an adult br br it a somewhat healthier snack than a typical bag of fried chips but it has calories per bag again not too bad but something to think about br br bottom line delicious ,delicious what else did you , delicious and delicious
despite coming in an extremely large box i found this to be great value all the bags were preserved with a reasonable expiration date that is months away i would definitely recommend ,great value , great product
these were nasty they were so greasy and too rich for my blood plus they lacked major flavor no spicy jalapeno flavor at all i was so dissapointed in these chips i am always hearing great things about these chips but i am telling you yuck yuck yuck give me pain chips any day maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but i am staying clear from these chips i wish i could give these zero stars if i could ,i have had better kettle chips , not as good as you are
if you like spicy then these are for you i like spicy so i enjoyed these they are also crunchy as kettle cooked chips should be ,spicy but good , great chips
these are decent but if you want a good salt and vinegar chip try salt and malt vinegar chips those are awesome ,salt and vinegar chips are way better , not as good as you are
being a salt free product is why i purchased this but the chips are quite greasy ,potato chips , great chips
these are the best potato chips that money can buy there is just enough salt to taste it but not so much that it the lingering after you have down a bag of these each chip has the perfect thickness my teeth get excited every time i put one in my mouth everything about these chips is so perfect it is like they were made by god and delivered by himself now that i know amazon carries these i do not even have to leave my house to buy them i may never eat anything else again ,lightly delicious , great chips
these things are just too darn cheesy if you like a lot of flavor you will love these otherwise you will on their goodness ,too much flavor , not as good as
and vitamin c my mother would approve of that and the fact that they are hand cooked in small batches br br i often enjoy kettle chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea but they are also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch well actually kettle chips go perfect with everything except sweets of course br br my only problem is that they are so delicious i cannot stop eating them that is the reason i chose these smaller packets i figured could last me almost a month if i was a good girl kept my appetite under control and them from the kids for the sake of fewer calories i try hard and have so far it is not easy but br br have i told you how much i love them br br reviewed by betty br the ,love at first bite and crunch , great taste
you do not need salt to hide the taste of potato chips and these chips prove it the taste of the potato comes through instead of being masked ok so they are still a snack food but no salt and no trans fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get and if you are on a low salt diet like i am having these available means i can eat chips and kettle are just the best ,the best chips , great chips
these potato chips are excellent there are no trans fats br br they taste absolutely delicious whenever i am in the mood for potatoe chips kettles is the brand i buy br br a great product that anyone should enjoy and i highly recommend them br br enjoy ,delicious extra crunchy , great chips
it feels strange to review chips but i am because these are my absolute favorite chips kettle has lots of flavors but i always go back to these regular lightly salted br br they are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag plus they often looked burned they are not actually burned it has something to do with how much sugar is in the potato that makes it dark i love to open a bag and find some browned chips br br lays and wise have their place but i have become a chip snob thanks to kettle br br like or ice cream some products are worth the money these are the best of the best ,chip , great chips
i have tried a lot of s v chips and these are the best real sea salt and real vinegar mouth watering flavor not for the faint of heart the flavor is very authentic ,best salt vinegar , great taste
kettle brand chips are very crunchy i would say regular plain old lays potato chips are at the soft end of the soft crunchy spectrum ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the but kettle brand chips are far more crunchy if you have a tender mouth or bad teeth you might want to steer clear of kettle brand otherwise you will love these chips the sea salt vinegar chips are super tangy i enjoy taking of vinegar bottles from time to time i am dissapointed with all other salt vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and or the vinegar taste and or chemically rest assured kettle sea salt vinegar has a gourmet flavor the vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could never be called ,gourmet salt vinegar chips , the best chips i have ever had
can be of any more help well the next bag was good since that time i have picked up bags of chips all were like the bad bag so i am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost i did some research and found out that kettle was bought out by a private company so the same cookie cutter processes are probably being at kettle acquire company with high quality brand sell product to mass merchants lower quality cost of product to increase and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the customer and employees lose out of course as does an buyer of the brand stay away from kettle chips they are no longer the same ,they changed the chips now they taste horrible , the best chips i have ever had
someone brought these to a party we had last month and i did not put them out because the buffet was full and did not think anyone would like potato chips last week we had some friends over and these were all i had in the pantry so i put them out oh my gosh they are so good i was so wrong to think they would be bland they are full of real potato flavor wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting i am here on amazon to buy a case i only want to have these with dips truly delicious ,do not miss the salt , great chips
these backyard bbq kettle chips were a great deal with the code it was nice to have a larger size bag some kettle chips in the grocery store are only about ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch they arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from amazon grocery have been great flavor and all natural ,great deal , great chips
i have tried utz wise pringles lays etc but kettle tasted the best the quantity of salt used is the optimum which is required br br although they say serving size ounce you will finish the whole packet in no time total calories is for ounce bag this is slightly on the higher side but still it is ok as they have not compromised on the taste br br only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips which taste bad kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there br br thanks to amazon to get bags for just bucks with free shipping using their coupon ,best chips out there , not as good as i be
chips are not as tangy as i hoped or expected brothers is a better choice for the hard core salt n vinegar fans ,great price but not as tangy as i expected , great chips
the first time i tried these i thought wow but i quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart hard to enjoy the potato of them when your mouth is under ,an potato chip , good but not great
got these kettle chips sea salt vinegar oz bags and was not impressed tasted kind of flat i was eating some out of the bag when i looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed then i started looking at all the unopened bags and many of them had this type same hole some bags had multiple holes one bag had a hole the size of a at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it the box they shipped in had no holes so they we are packed this way so much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired needless to say i will never be eating anymore kettle products and expect a full refund from kettle or amazon br m ,kettle chips , delicious and tasty
in the fridge seems to boost the flavor even more and using them rather than corn chips to make nachos will have your tastebuds like but without any of the associated highly recommended ,delicious , great chips
when originally produced in england these we are the best chips i had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the us they now taste plain nasty hard rather than crispy are much thinner than they used to be and lacking any flavour a real shame ,gone down , great chips
after opening numerous bags i found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them completely plain and gross how does this even happen ,off , great chips
meals a day plus snacks it also me to eat s l o w l y because that one big bag or many little bags never lasts as long as i would like anyway with excercise and sensible eating the rest of the month and keeping my scale nearby and myself at least twice a day every day i have taken off ten pounds in the last three months br br these backyard barbeque flavour potato chips from kettle br are totally scrumptious except for those chips which tasted good but were far too spicy for my own taste buds i have yet to meet a potato chip i did not like to eat these kettle backyard barbeque flavour potato chips with their combination of potatoes sweetness and spices have truly become one of my top five if not the very first favourite of all br br flavoured potato perfection ,c k y a r d b a r b e c u e , great product
these chips are okay personally i find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange they are not necessarily bad but they are the kind of chip where you are only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty ,not the best , great chips
i have bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning keeps you from eating too many occasionally i get really stale items from amazon com and this was one beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case not expired but stale and just the same ,stale beware buying these on special , good but not great
these chips are very good i could not stop eating them they did not last very long br br the reason i gave them stars instead of is because i think the bags are a little hard to open i am not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier ,these are very good , great chips
kettle brand chips used to be so good oily crunchy flavorful i suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse now they are no better than any other big name brand chip try the good health kettle style olive oil chips instead they are as good as the kettle brand once was r i p kettle brand chips ,used to be my favorite chips , delicious
you can absolutely forget about these confirmed by other reviewers these chips are now total garbage like chewing on styrofoam packaging peanuts positively awful no or i will never buy anything from kettle brand ever again from a once great premium brand literally any mass market chip i have ever tried tastes better than these stale and rancid tasting and virtually no salty taste whatsoever completely awful ,taste and if you like even the bit of salt flavor on your chips , great chips
these chips are nasty i thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag no the chips were just soaked with grease nasty ,disgusting , great chips
unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual of salt and drinking actual vinegar i doubt you will like these chips these are the chips i have ever had and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because i paid for full boxes and dont like to waste food the brown chips are especially bad besides being salty and sour they also taste overcooked and burnt unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste you will not like these chips br br i actually have a high tolerance for sour taste so i can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty but normal people please do not try this at home ,taste terrible way too strong , not as good as i be
i bought this brand as a trial since i am tired of the br br it claims that it is natural i have no on this but the point is that more than in the bag is over fried and in brown color i really suffer eating the over fried chips i open some other bags and it looks like the same so i just throw away all of them i do not know if i was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same but for sure i will never buy this brand any more ,over , great chips
they are good but wish they were also baked have not found baked no salt potato chips anywhere if there are any i wish someone would post ,no salt kettle chips , good chips
these are better in england i do not know why maybe it is just on my part ,not as good as the english , good
i ordered kettle chips in the following br salt fresh ground pepper br cheese br n y cheddar and hers br br they all tasted the same to me if there is a variety pack suggest u order before ordering large size br br i wish i could return the unopened bags ,very disappointed , great chips
i purchased these because of the low salt and they were indeed low in salt however many many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil i have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands it was very and who wants all that oil i will never buy these again and i would not recommend them to others ,in oil , good chips
if you are looking for strong s v flavor these definitely are not for you very mild in comparison to many others i live in tx and i can tell you i have tried all s v chips i can get of the best of the best are heb and world market bob and are not bad from a chip they have typically great kettle crunch but if you are looking for s v flavor these have just a touch ,not so good , great taste
i do not know if it was the case of chips we received or what but everyone we allowed to sample the chips in a buffet style setting agreed that these were slightly on the salty side br one person stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow due to the amount of salt in these br br we had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the lay kettle potato chips but these kettle brands bbq chips are the exact opposite br br sorry folks we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side br br we are still looking forward to amazon finally getting the lay kettle potato chips in stock br these got a star because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique ,bags o salt with chips added , the best chips i have ever had
these chips are greasy and taste burnt there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it especially at the bottom of the bag even if they are trans fat free they need to be a lot less greasy ,chips , great chips
not as tasty as the munchies which are my family favorite kettle are dark burnt more broken bits taste greasy oily and not the light crunch oh well ,they are not , delicious
i love sour food but this one i cannot bear too strong sour taste and even when you open the bag the sour smell is too strong i do not like it ,too sour , not as good as it is
unless you really really really like vinegar avoid those chips should have been called vinegar and sea salt not sea salt and vinegar ,awful taste , good chips
i have loved kettle brand sea salt and vinegar chips since the first time i tried them the fact that i was able to find them on line for such a great price was wonderful i would definitely make the purchase again they are a quick and simple snack for lunch and it goes great with my cold sandwich ,delicious , delicious
food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage a bunch more salt and msg stuffed in under the label yeast extract they removed the no msg from the label so they know very well what they did br br the worst part though is that they taste horrible instead of crisp oily and full of character say as if they were cooked in like a kettle or something they instead have the color and of baked lays the spicy thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid br br what a shame no more kettle chips for me it seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore ,kettle has out the chips are horrible now , the best chips i have ever had
the chips were great for the first few bags however after the first bag or two i noticed that the remaining bags were damaged there were holes in each bag and black sticky stains on the outside other reviewers who bought around the same time that i did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips br br the chips came in a sealed kettle box so it is hard to say who up but someone somewhere up these chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag now it is like a game of ,the bags were damaged with and , great chips
oz bags to arrive upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse do not know if it is still in the box but it is outside on the when my son gets home i am going to have pictures taken and email to amazon the outside amazon box was intact so it had to be either from the kettle chips people or the amazon warehouse do not know which i will never buy these again from amazon i cannot tell you how disgusted i am with this purchase it makes me sick to think about it br br i included pictures at the top of the page poor little must have high cholesterol now br br update i forgot to mention that i offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to amazon but was told they did not want them ,kettle chips make great food , not as good as i like the

i am a great fan of potato chips and of thai food i was so happy when kettle chips decided to two of my great loves together what a concept these chips are spicy enough without burning a hole in your tongue also they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming careful once in a while this is a treat definitely worth in ,great hot new flavor , great chips
terrible i cannot believe this i received this item and every single bag was opened but i am in and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on i was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and out all in the box gross and the box is filled with grease stains if it was from the ride all the way here but the box should have been more and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper i am very unhappy with stale chips out the bag and us cannot enjoy now ,horrible i believe this , great chips
after reading some of the reviews i got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst no worries here all bags are in great shape and expiration dates are not until june chips at least from the first bag taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world by the way fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so yay team ,favorite kettle flavor and a great value , not as good as it is
kettle potato chips new york cheddar these are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are salty on the burnt side and taste rancid either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old i want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then but after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips these just do not hit the spot for me ,kettle brand potato chips new , delicious

said that these chips are oily which is true but they explain that on their website at kettle foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high sunflower and or safflower oil to make kettle brand products both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way we have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are trans fat free meaning none were detected you will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging that is natural and happens when quality oil is being used br br you will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor i am also a fan of their unsalted potato chips for those of us watching our salt intake the unsalted chips is the best you can get period ,great chip , great chips
later tried to find them at the world market in at the creek shopping center and they did not carry this flavor however when i learned that they were available on amazon com and also available for prime shipping i bought them as soon as i read kettle chips honey dijon ounce bags pack of br br you get a pretty big box filled with bags of these delicious morsels they last quite a while but i will re order very very soon i suggest you buy them in this bulk form and enjoy them you will not be disappointed they go great with hamburgers and hot dogs so they are perfect for spring and this coming summer outdoor activities and cook br br take my word for it these chips are a hidden lost in the world of snack foods buy some today and fall in love like me ,awesome and delicious , great for a great price

i have found this product kettle chips unsalted to be fabulous i found them by accident on amazon after hunting all over my local stores they are crisp and tasty without all of the salt ,kettle chips , great chips
when i saw the spicy thai chips i knew i had to try them i love spicy and i love thai food so why not first off these chips are not super spicy they actually taste sort of sweet at first with many degrees of flavor the spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards i would say these are definitely a good unique chip but if you absolutely hate sweet chips i would try a different flavor since these are a little sweet ,spicy thai , great taste
these are my favorite but they are not for everybody in a way they sort of taste like oriental flavor ramen but with a kick for me how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger they are a bit rich so they are not for snacking because this is a case purchase i recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case the oz size seems to be no longer available which is a shame i can eat the entire oz bag ,my favorite kettle chip , not as good as you are
salt vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so i think i have tried every brand out there these are by far the best i also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy they seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste ,best salt vinegar chips out there , great chips
package arrived double boxed wrapped and the inside box that holds the goods perfect not a single dent or rough mark outstanding packaging br br the product br br these are the best chips on the planet salt n vinegar flavor is beyond among the best chips i have ever had you might actually i am sure you probably will not like it at first bite if you have never had these before but try it again br br not to mention this particular flavor has held up in numerous and comparisons against other manufactures ,amazing service , great chips
if you love jalapeno chips then kettle is a must try br nice and with the kick of jalapeno br delicious br addicting br recommended ,crunchy and spicy , great chips
he and i have become addicted br br first kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc than many other chips as one the dietary information br br second individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them br br third the jalapeno has some kick not overly hot of course too many products labelled as spicy are not have no kick and are as bland as can be here you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno my preference a bit more heat but i understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than i would still decent br br all in all i have been pretty happy with this product in the few weeks since we first bought it i now purchase a package each week in my to the local grocery store ,pretty tasty and , good chips but not as good as you are
after looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box i had to write a review i have bought these chips numerous times from amazon warehouse deals and each time they came packaged perfectly there was a sale at the end of the summer and i received a few cases boxes for just over the chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag i them in the garage and only remembered them when i went out there that way i did not eat them all as far as the pictures if the person contacted amazon he made out ok amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called amazon thanks for a great tasting product good price and quick shipping i will buy these again soon ,great tasting chips , great chips
there is nothing too good or too bad about these chips if you like plain potato chips you would like these they are thicker than most brands fresh out of box very crunchy and not too salty for me one bag has a lot i generally cannot finish it by myself part of the reason is that they are too oily some chips almost look transparent if you know what i mean the taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me if you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice except salt as the name says i do not think i will buy these again the best by date on my bags are march and i ordered them at the end of october ,kettle chips sea salt , not as good as i have
i love this sea salt vinegar flavor from kettle when i saw this one on the daily deal here for case i put my order without doubt however when i received the case i found out that the whole case is in december while i got it at the end of august i tried one package and i can definitely taste the in the chips i was disappointed and then i found out this item is not returnable how convenient although i love this chips i will not order from here again with the concern of close expiration date ,good deal but close date , great chips
this is the second purchase of kettle potato chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them we bought them by the a carton of bags the kettle chips were in a oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal the chips are so delicious baked not fried and lightly salted with sea salt they have fat no preservatives nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients what more could you ask for in a great tasting chip ,great tasting chips , great taste

kettle chips are thicker and crunchier though at times than other chips and the honey dijon flavor is great they do not have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have and the oz size is great for an adult size snack ,some of the best chips anywhere , delicious
i have always liked salt and vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag not with these the vinegar is right from the first chip and doesnt stop until you have finished the bag these are very addictive if you like salt and vinegar these are the ultimate chips nothing else compares ,the standard for salt and vinegar chips , great chips
tasted good spicy those that do not like spicy should stay away from this for the price paid very good buy ,yummy , good
these are seriously delicious especially if you like plain potato chips my only concern is they are very oily i understand they are kettle chips and they are fried small batches and all but when you open the bag that another thing very strong bag need scissors there is a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves i suggest a shake on some paper towels before consuming either way they have a yummy potato taste and very satisfying crunch delicious ,delicious , delicious
this bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool such as scissors do not even try without scissors br br they are crispy and taste like chips that are not advertised as being salted they definitely are not healthy because i can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them and i can see the grease at the bottom of the bag too br br they are high quality chips and deserve to be put on your table ,lightly yet tasty , good chips but not as good as you are
potato chips i have ever eaten with a variety of flavors from classic barbeque to their unique spicy thai you will find the right flavor for your mouth and not only do they taste wonderful but these all natural chips are cooked in safflower or sunflower oil for zero cholesterol br br but why is it a more product of the week kettle foods inc is a green giant a company for their environmental practices they convert waste oils to to power some of their company a roof top panel system creates for production and they of their additional u s energy by buying energy not only are their for the future but they care for the present by a eco system and during recent building construction they a gold rating from in energy and environmental design br br now your mouth will thank you and so will the environment ,yummy , great product
these really are amazing chips do not be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheese it is so subtle that even blue cheese haters like me will enjoy these ,kettle chips are addictive , great chips
these chips are delicious i am on a low sodium diet i did not have to give up totally something that i truely love to snack these chips are bursting with flavor and you cannot really tell they are missing all that salt there is just a kiss worth on a chip but me it is a total ,the chip with a of salt , great chips
not too salty like regular supermarket chips this is a snack that will not overwhelm you with guilt when you just gotta have some chips kettle chips lightly salted chips are the what you have been searching for br br there no cholesterol no trans fats no artificial anything and because of the manufacturing process they actually seem to have kind of a home made quality br br this is an excellent product ,crunch wow , delicious and healthy chips
i agree with the company a natural i tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about percent the flavor of these is very strong so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread otherwise they compete or with the other food ,great strong flavor , great product
the new york cheddar flavor is my favorite of all the kettle brand potato chips these are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy unfortunately it may do the opposite to your so do not do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroom br br i still give it a of stars br br also the online price at amazon is better than anywhere else i have seen them combined with amazon prime you will be getting a great deal on these chips ,yummy for your tummy , great taste
these are my new favorite i have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey have replaced them as my new number one they do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these br br price wise i do not see that they are that much of a deal here i purchased them for at the grocery with no shipping i would have given the product stars easily had it not been for the price the taste is fabulous you will not be disappointed ,best chips out there , great taste
these chips were good i ended up eating a whole bag a day for a while cause they were so good i am glad that they do not have any dextrose in them like lays do ,these chips tasted good , great chips
these are the best chips out there nothing can beat this taste if you like honey mustard then you will definitely like this once you eat it you wont stop addicting stuff ,awesome chips , great chips
i dont know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did i checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me ,i dont know if , not as good as
at first i was thinking cheese flavored chips but i love them the herbs they used are just delicious the cheese is not overpowering they are yummy and crispy ,delicious , delicious
good anymore and the spice level is virtually non br br here are the original and new ingredient listings br br original ingredients br select potatoes safflower and or sunflower oil honey powder evaporated cane syrup honey salt garlic powder jalapeno pepper ground ginger onion powder habanero pepper dried parsley citric acid cilantro extract ginger oil cayenne pepper white pepper lime oil br br new ingredients br potatoes safflower and or sunflower oil sugar dried cane syrup salt maltodextrin yeast extract spices garlic powder onion powder dried parsley jalapeno powder citric acid natural flavors lime extract br br i m assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner blue diamond they might want to get rid of great taste naturally from their bags as i do not consider maltodextrin to be very natural br br great job kettle way to ruin a great thing ,kettle foods spicy thai chips , delicious
i try to be good but when i feel like in some delicious gourmet potato chips these new york potato chips are the first flavor i like to go for when i see them at the natural food store the chips are tangy and crunchy and satisfy your potato chip fix like no other brand ,these potato chips are yummy , great chips
and that is the problem i order these by the case of and when they are good which is over half the time they are the best kettle chip the best and then i get a case of the worse the potatos are and old so i just throw them out and order again expensive but when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best the last case is what prompted me to write this the potatos were weird like they were almost sour as in going bad and i even wrote the company that makes them so if you want the best kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are not the best try again br i myself am done ordering because it is me out that they are using potatos and either not or not caring ,only awful they are awful , best ever
all the chips you get for the price i got the z x bags and wow it is so many for the price you can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging also well being used to the cheaper chips i was not expecting how mellow these things are the ones i am used to have a really sour taste to them which i did not mind but they had tons of flavor these chips do not have any sour to them at all and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste if you want to try out salt and vinegar chips i suggest you try these out first so for the price and how many you get these chips are definately worth it they are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants i recommend these stars ,stars for price and taste , great chips
we have long enjoyed this brand of chip so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these br br granted i bought them somewhat because i am a confirmed salt generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans i was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot br br how nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt ,crispy crunchy and , great taste
for those who love salt and vinegar potato chips this is the one to choose the flavor is zippy and tart with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less natural versions of this snack the ounce bags are just right to share at lunch the chips are a little greasy and that is why i have given them stars instead of ,tangy and delicious snack , great chips
kettle lightly chips are my favorite on the market i do not care for the fancy flavors and these are salted just right thick super crunchy and full of flavor they are the best ,best chip , delicious
these chips are tasty but not what i expected from a low salt item they seem as salty as any regular potato chip and they also seem excessively greasy by comparison cod reduced fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy ,not low salt , great chips
fantastic tasting potato chips i love the individual bags great for kids and adults too no trans fat no cholesterol no artifical stuff br low in sodium and high in potassium which is great for people like me with br only problem is amazon is out of stock some times and price is high ,best chips i have ever tasted , great chips
the chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips the bags are very strong much thicker than say lay potato chip bags inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips salted just right because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion some are cooked more than others which gives it a more authentic non manufactured feel some people may not like that br br i reccomend them ,tasty , great chips
my yo is a kettle chip addict so i was so happy to find snack size bags for his lunch great quality and much cheaper than in the stores will definitely be buying more ,love the smaller bags , great taste
flavoring stuff which is initially satisfying then becomes too much and certainly is not good for the or general nutritional issues br br and the package cannot be opened without a sharp i could not pull it apart at the top as i am used to doing i do not normally carry a knife or scissors and do not have rodent teeth well i was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key even then the bag was wow thick and tough br br on the package it says these are krinkle cut chips turns out that means the kind not what i wanted i do not eat style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth so this information is important br br these are good but so are other brands with which i do not have these problems ,things you need to know , good but not great
this may sound but i actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when i ordered these kettle brand jalapeno chips at the time i placed my order i could not remember the name of the jalapeno chips that i had recently discovered and liked and the kettle brand chips were packaged in a similarly colored bag but it all worked out for the best because i do really like the kettle brand of jalapeno chips and will happily munch away on them during upcoming tv football when i run out probably sometime next year i will purchase miss brand of jalapeno chips and i plan to try the other flavors of kettle brand chips imho kettle brand chips are excellent and i recommend them to all potato chip br br sincerely br br ,i made a , the best chips i have ever had
miss are better but unfortunately less widely available i am not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and miss are better imho ,ok but miss are better , not as good as it is
i want to like kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil which are both gmo and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy but these things bite back on the plus side the of them may keep you from enjoying too many on the minus side a mouthful of cuts and is not worth it do they have to be so hard and crunchy what is wrong with simply light and crispy i prefer lay texture but suffer with kettle due to the of gmos and corn soy i wish they would come out with something less harsh on the mouth though ,do they have to bite back , not as good as it is
i think these chips are awesome if not the best along with poor brothers salt and chips but if you buy these spicy thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor at the bottom of the bag in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time i bought these off amazon but that was like in so i would suggest trying spicy thai in a bag bigger then ounces ,these chips are awesome if not best but , great chips
this kettle chips taste good crispy crunchy too u will enjoy it also it cut sliced ,kettle chips , delicious
i knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips the price per bag cannot be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated ,great deal , great chips
this is a delicious tea br br i m just now becoming a tea and really the stuff i like and earl grey is amongst the top especially with bergamot br br the problem i find is the amount of bergamot added is usually too little or too much br br this one is perfect i really like the balance in the flavor i do not add anything to this tea just a part of a teaspoon in a cup and in minutes it is ready br br tastes like an expensive tea but priced like lipton definitely recommend it for fans of earl grey with a kick ,what a great tea at this price , not as good as i have

excellent lo fat lo calorie treat for dogs i have a german and these treats are her favorite the organic peanut butter cookies are for smaller dogs but she loves them and for weight control i like them ,the best , great treat
my male maltese dog had been enjoying the old puppy biscuits from walmart then i could not find them i was desperate to find a treat that would measure up i ordered six bags of the peanut butter and my fingers br br they arrived and my little guy loves them he gets one heart shaped biscuit at bedtime he in a crate when he me touch the bag of treats he beats a to his crate in high excitement they are a big hit with my him they are well worth the price they are high quality and i can even smell peanuts in them ,a huge , my dog loves these
this product does a great job of out the it has helped make my husband feel lots better even though he is in early renal failure ,for your health , great product
the oil too i put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it it tasted fine then i added one drop of the oil it is very strong and stirred it in it tasted so much better i whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat br br now i will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream it was such a happy accident to find out how to use it when added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream br br it is very potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch ,do not taste from mix with vanilla for true flavor , good product
we make up a coffee creamer with part commercial coffee creamer vanilla butter creme almond and creme flavors and the rest milk it tastes wonderful and is half the price of store bought br br it is excellent ,creme flavor oil , great coffee
am from and i was raised on vernor ginger ale once i moved to california though i found it difficult to find vernor it would pop up here and there and then disappear i guess without advertising it just never found a home br br i prefer the plastic bottles but the ideal size is the oz ml or the one liter the problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person me too long to drink it letting it go flat br br in any case vernor is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years i think that imparts a great unique flavor br br i wish it would catch on again and become available more widely br br recently i did see it on sale in city in california bay area south of san francisco the next day it was gone ,the soft drink is still the best , not as good as i be
is still aged in oak for years no doubt for the smoothness all in all a great soda for anytime the soda is also known like other ginger drinks for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach br vernor is a regional soda and there are many areas of the country you cannot find it in that is why it sells here they may be selling it in glass bottles again soon at least there is a page that says so the day i am writing this comment search at amazon for b to see what i mean has quite a history and there are two books at amazon about the soda the first is vernor ginger ale of america michigan the second book is the vernor story from to now a book about the company marketing green and gold packaging with the famous and vernor fans ,made in , the best soda i have ever had
less cut the heat in the oven by degrees f if there is oil in the recipe cut it by use a tablespoon or two of coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid just do not use too much or your recipe will be dry additionally when baking make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry most might already know this but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients unless beaten with butter first br br agave nectar does not like other sugars do so you will not be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy however i highly recommend it for baking it makes everything br br if you are looking for less caramel flavor you will need to use the light version of this product equally good in all ,caramel flavor excellent for baking and for using too , i love this stuff
good quality nectar very tasty br br however i was expecting fluid ounces not ounces in weight br br i find that ounces in weight makes about fluid ounces ,these oz not , good but not great
first time i have ever used agave nectar and it is great keeps the blood sugar stable great buy also ,great buy , great product
this sweetner is the best it brings out the true flavors in what ever you add it to and it has great health ,excellent sweetner , great
i love this stuff it sweetens without the blood glucose levels now if i could only figure out how to make tequila i would be set just kidding ,syrup , great product
i finally have found a natural sugar substitute that has the added benefit of having a low glycemic index agave is delicious i have recommended it to many friends and it is very economical to purchase the oz bottles ,sugar substitute , great product
i used to buy the wholesome sweetners agave and like it a little better but switched because it became too expensive so this is the option the taste is the same but it seems a little less sweet because i find i have to use more of it to get the right sweetness in my coffee i do not like the container it does not pour well so i have to pour it into a better squeeze bottle so that i do not have a sticky mess on my counter every day it is fine for the price i continue to have it shipped to me every other month ,good but could be better , not as good as i be
i love using this to sweeten tea coffee etc it tastes much better than other low glycemic sweeteners there is no bitter aftertaste ,great stuff , great tea
i ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product it works great for cooking baking and as a substitute sugar in my chai lattes ,healthy sweetener , great product
i really like this product and taste great with the coffee or tea and i have lost weight by cutting the sugar and replacing it with the honey and agave nectar ,great way the sugar , great tea
have not tried it on still using sugar is making kombucha i still use sugar as i am not sure it would be a good idea to introduce a raw into kombucha but actually that may just be my own over caution and nothing related to actual chemistry or br br our primary uses are sweetening yogurt using it in the little baking i do and use in salad dressings fruit desserts etc because we are limiting our sweets consumption we do not use a lot of this but it is nice to have when we need it i plan to try using it in some homemade jams later this season i buy it on subscription and the cost is about less than the local walmart and more than less than the health food store on this same brand best by date on the bottles i received in may is ,great substitute sweetener , not as good as i be
i am so glad i was introduced the this brand of sweetner to replace sugar this is so much better i really like how it sweetens my herbal sweet teas without having to use too much and how it can be used in place of pancake syrup too learning how to use it what the first thing i had to learn once i learned how to use it i became hooked i would not even look at sugar any more i highly reccomend if you want a clean fresh taste and feel to your foods if you do purchase this sweetner take advantage of ship and save it will save you lots of money in the long run ,my go to sweetner , great product
i love this product it is the best natural sweetener i have ever tried and i have tried many you can use also as pancake syrup or as a substitute for honey on your peanut butter and honey sandwich it last a long time and is a good value ,the best , best ever
i have been using agave nectar for several months now and have found it to be a staple in my home agave nectar is good tasting it was a good buy ,yummy , great product
this stuff is great because it is low glycemic substitute this to sugar and you will be doing your body a great favor this size is economical and shipping is fast too i got mine very soon ,healthy stuff , great product
this is an awesome product which i have ordered many times honey like flavored lower glycemic sweetener that is great in coffee or tea ,sweet , delicious
thank you for this product we use it all the time and appreciate your and the price was excellent thanks again ,great product , great product
i am on a low glycemic index diet to help control my blood sugar and hormone levels my nutritionist recommended agave nectar as a sweetener since it is gi index is in the low as opposed to honey in the low and sugar in the mid i have tried supermarkets health food stores and wholesale clubs the prices are usually around for a oz bottle and this is ish for x oz it is used like honey substitute c for every c sugar and reduce liquids by th br br i also use it in a carrot cake recipe equal substitution instead of sugar where i substitute whole wheat flour instead of white flour and i do not decrease the other liquids it is delicious and you would never know that is it is actually good for you ,best price on that i have found , great product
i am very disappointed with this product because i could not see how many calories it has at the time i ordered it i received it and now i can see it has calories per tablespoon granulated sugar has only calories per tablespoon how could agave nectar be better than sugar ,how this could be good , not as good as it is
i was out to dinner with friends family at the in complex in fl besides having an awesome staff ask for and fabulous food the is a must they serve china mist tea this is the st time i chose the tropical organic green i have no doubt it is the best flavored tea i have ever had ,best tea i ever had , great tea
if you have tried the conventional kettle crinkle chip salt and you cannot compare these to those these are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat but enjoyable you finish the bag and the is just coated with spices great stuff ,that is a spicy , not as good as it is
these are the best tasting tortilla chips i have ever had i have become allergic to tomatoes but i love tortilla chips there is so much flavor in these chips that i no longer miss pico de i prefer to eat them plain they also have just the right amount of heat to make them but not spicy ,who needs salsa when chips taste this good , delicious
these potato chips are delicious i have not had potato chips in approximately two years as it has been difficult to find organic chips amazon lowered the price on these and i finally had a chance to order them i most definitely will be ordering them again my family and i love them they are pure and void of all artificial flavorings the true flavor is present and it the need for something salty sweet spicy and crunchy a ,delicious , great chips
these chips are a great snack if you do not want all the junk with chips try them you will like them ,organic yummy chips what more can you for , great chips
i love these chips the flavor is not plain they are sweet and spicy all at the same time the only drawback is it has a tad bit too much salt but it still a great flavor ,very different flavor , great chips
t like hot food they might be a bit much for you they have a great balance of sweetness and spice of course kettle chips are just good chips they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty i also like that they are chips those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me i do not want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness if you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips ,these are the best available bbq chips , great chips
just the right amount of spice to make them hot and they are also sweet very hard to find in new jersey can not have just one bag around ,my favorite chips from kettle , great taste
i cannot believe how wonderful this chip is the slightly spicy after taste gives the chip extra punch and flavor my family and i are addicted ,amazing taste best chip ever , delicious
these chips are perfect for snacking with or without salsa the texture is brittle and thin like other plocky chips br br the only downside the spice is minimal ,tasty , great chips
i think plocky brand as a whole is a cut above in quality but i found these to lack in taste somewhat and be a little greasy ,sweet whole grain , not as good as
these are the best chips i have ever eaten everyone in our family loves them sweet but spicy crispy really good delivery was perfect no crushed chips fantastic overall ,yummy chips , great chips
a nice case of chips that are quite tasty i definitely enjoy the kettle sea salt and black pepper i just wish they were bigger bags ,tasty , great chips
i ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service oh my word spicy but not burning spicy more like tongue warming salty a really strongly flavored and delicious chip if you like barbecue flavor this is a nice sweet br br i also like that it is organic br br i ate the oz bag in less than minutes my bad but if they are not delicious br br granted oz is not a whole lot it was skimpy for the price which is often the case when it comes to organic but it was calories at a pop br br yes cals per oz serving that is about par for the course for fried chips br br verdict fattening crispy flavorful delicious best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low fat sandwich or soup br br enjoy br br ,so for those to chips , not as good as i be
at first you think that these chips are not all that spicy but the spice will grow on you with each bite they are really very good ,the spice will grow , great chips
i cannot say enough good things about plocky chips i have purchased this flavor and the black bean flavor a href http www amazon com gp product b g plocky tortilla chips black beans n rice ounce bags pack of a and i love them they taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying i have never eaten a tortilla chip that did not make me feel guilty afterwards not with plocky i always eat less and feel satisfied i actually prefer these eaten by themselves no dips and i keep a bag in my desk at work i have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something i bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too i am a fan of plocky chips and will continue to purchase them on amazon ,the best tortilla chips i have ever , the best chips i have ever had

i was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued kettle flavor but was disappointed when i opened the box and found this substitution i am keeping them but would not have ordered bags of this flavor it is a very good bbq chip but i could get this flavor at the grocery store why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued the one star is for the substitution the country bbq is a start chip but not the chip i for ,wrong flavor got country bbq instead of chili , great product
we love these chips they can be eaten alone since they are so crisp and tasty or with a dip every one that we have introduced the chips to loves them and the expiration date is for months from now so ordering bags did not come near to them going stale ,great , great chips
i bought these chips and wanted to try if they were tasty it sure is unique and different flavor and the right thickness br br it remains crunchy spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat there are some rice granules with the tortilla chips however some of the spices are lacking from this chip but i liked this very much br br i would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips go ahead you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese maybe some el shredded meat tomatoes ,rice and beans tortilla chips , great chips

these chips are the only ones i found to be tasty and healthy they have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutrition the perfect blend ,tortilla chips tasty and healthy , great chips
we love these cannot always get them in local stores they do not keep them stocked even though we are always buying them out strong enough to dip in any condiment great flavor and grain texture ,grain tortilla chips , great taste
these spicy chips have a lot of great flavor but be warned you will be left with some breath afterwards the first time i ate these was at night and then even after brushing and i could taste them in my mouth the next morning so just be careful about when you eat them especially if you will be hanging out with people later in the day ,tasty but make sure you have gum , great chips
the first time i ate these chips was in in i could not find them in our area ct so you can imagine my joy when i found them on amazon i love these and hope you continue to carry them your prices are terrific too i pay in and they run about a bag when i buy the case of through amazon good job only problem is now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in but that is ok sharing is good ,do not these chips , great chips

these chips are salty with a hint of sweet they are crisp and crunchy they are the best chips i have ever had ,really good chips , great chips
we ordered these only because the black beans and rice which we really really love was out of stock after about a week we finally opened up a package and then kicked ourselves for not having tried them earlier there is a little kick to them after you swallow them to let you know you have had a hint of hot pepper of some sort we took them to a pot luck that night and came home with an empty bag i used them from another bag as a garnish on a salad that i took to the pot luck and we came home with an empty salad bowl br we will definitely order these again a href http www amazon com gp product b plocky tortilla chips red beans n rice ounce bags pack of a ,tortilla chips red beans n rice , great chips
i was first introduced to the red rice beans chips in my of pa when i moved to north carolina i was unable to find these chips in my local area on my trips back home i would buy a bunch of bags to bring back with me to then i discovered that i could order them on line and life was great these chips are my all time favorite and everyone that i serve them to loves them just the same you just gotta try them you will be hooked ,simply the best , great chips
ok if you do not want to get addicted do not try plocky red beans and rice tortilla chips my husband and i started with one seemingly bag from a store now we have just received our second case it will not last long beware ,addicted , great chips
my husband who being mexican is very picky about his tortilla chips and i absolutely love these the texture is light and crispy rather than thick and crunchy he actually usually prefers a very hearty chip like el but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we are both with them the bean rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that we go through an amount of them i never ever like plain chips but these i can eat without anything else although they are particularly amazing with a fresh salsa i highly recommend these ,perfect tortilla chip goodness , great chips
a href http www amazon com gp product b plocky tortilla chips red beans n rice ounce bag pack of a i first tasted these chips while visiting relatives in ky they are not available where i live so i ordered them from amazon wow my friends and family are all addicted to them the spicy flavor you at the first bite once a bag is open it is gone ,these chips are addictive , great chips
we like these chips for salsa and better than any other on the market they are even great by themselves we will order these as long as they are available thank you for making them br br ,best tortilla chips ever , great chips
i guess there is no telling what will the palate i am a huge tabasco fan and i love snacks but these do not taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they are made from i did not find them to have much of a kick at all practically bland in fact even with my strong to wasting food i had to throw out or give away most of the case do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on ,meh , not as good as it is
yeast extract is listed as an ingredient sounds right specifically these chips contain yeast extract which is on a chemical level it is just derived from a different source but it has all the same toxic properties kettle still advertises their products as containing no msg while they that their chips are not safe for people with msg sensitivities ,the organic is misleading , delicious and healthy
these were not flavorful enough for my taste it seems that all the seasoning falls off the chips and to the bottom of the bag too bad because i really liked the idea of a healthier potato chip i would not buy these again ,kind of bland , good chips but not as good as you are
plocky chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness they are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips the flavor out performs any tortilla chip i have ever eaten they hold up great to salsas and dips nothing wimpy about them i just wish the company made a bigger bag love them usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty order by the case you will be glad you did as they disappear fast ,delicious chips , great chips
i love these chips and ordered them after i had some in florida my case of chips came without any packing inside all bags in a box with no at all needless to say most of the chips were broken and i would not order them again a great item but if they cannot package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money ,broken chips but tasty , great chips
i received this chips in a gift basket and absolutely loved them i searched high and low but was unable to find them until i saw them here i immediately ordered a case these chips are light crispy flavorful and good for you i love them with dip in chili or just plain once you try them you will be hooked ,the best chips ever , great chips
these chips are truly amazing they have it all they are light crisp great tasting nice texture and they are all natural and low in fat and sodium need i say more i recently bought a bag of them at a regular grocery store and could not my taste buds that is why i excited why i saw them here on amazon and decided to buy a case ,excellent tortilla chips , great chips
these are the most fantastic chips i have ever had i could eat the whole bag myself they are made with lots of whole grain and beans and make a complete protein so i have no about feeding them to my kids as snacks they are great the only problem i have with them the bag is too small we need a bigger bag ,black beans never tasted so good , great chips
i did not like these potatoe chips it is hot and sweet with an overwhelming taste of garlic it is also a bit salty ,not my favorite chip , good chips
they did a very good job with shipping the order quickly nothing like hardware who took a week to ship ,very delivery , not as good as
long story short these are very tasty we have purchased a number of flavors from this brand this is my favorite br br but as noted by another reviewer these contain msg in the form of yeast extract br br it has become a popular means of hiding msg lately by calling it different things as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what i consume i find the whole process of hiding in plain site very br br also the bag is not very large but half of it is air this may well help in shipping but when paying a premium price for organic it just seems more deceptive ,very tasty but beware , great taste
wonderful candy hard to find i got a huge bag and put it in freezer it came shipped nicely in a sturdy box and heavy plastic just great ,great candy , great taste
i bought s for my dad for a surprise birthday present because he could not find them any where else ,candy , great product
so surprised to find the shaped pineapple cakes they are so cute br i ve never found any pineapple cake like this at our local asian supermarkets so i ordered some from here these lovely made our dragon festival party much more fun my friends and i think it is a good idea to order them again for our mid festival party ,cute cute cute , great taste
i really like the pineapple shortcakes sold here unlike some of the mass production pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring pineapple shortcakes use real and it makes the whole world difference you can even taste the from pineapple br br i opted for the traditional pineapple this time i will be interested in trying out the or mango variety next time ,a find , not as good as it is
i purchased this pack of big ass soda and only got immediately i was all like oh man this is gonna suck regardless of the quantity error though it sure kicked some red br br everyone in my town absolutely loves it i highly recommend along with other soda br br ,taste , great taste
well being the big red fan that i am i bought some of this first of all let me tell you the price is amazing i mean where else can you get this type of deal in everyone in loved it of course now they are wondering when the next shipment will get it ,amazing , good
expiration date smashed and stale edible not real enjoyable for the price i paid one of the best pretzel i had when br i purchased them from publix they stopped carrying them i must find another addiction ,a bit on the stale , not as good as it is
this cinnamon cake loaf has a wonderful natural flavor it is moist and tender and a great little sweet treat when you want something that is not terribly bad for your diet it is delicious ,delicious , delicious
unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously i to not look for the word in this offer and since i was then receiving free shipping had delivered we that is my husband guests and me knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed but currently amazon featured the babka and now i am awaiting to receive these in the future i will read more carefully ,disappointed , great product
under the crust was an goo the best i can it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in better of dead no raisins in it though br i tried to stir it together and the end result was goo with white in it when the knife to spread it long on goo from my knife br i opted for making my own frosting instead very easy a little palm shortening a lot of powdered sugar a tiny splash of vanilla a tiny bit of salt and rice milk as needed for consistency beat for minutes and i had the fluffy butter cream frosting i thought i would get from br br i wonder if our can was in the store whole foods or something br i ve read positive reviews of their frosting mix so maybe i will try that next time ,something was wrong with the batch , good but not as good as i be
well i opened it and it is sticky mess i am so mad at myself for wasting my money and not trying to make it from scratch at home which would probably end up better and cheaper oh well live and learn ,down the , not as good as it is
i love kitchen and have tried almost all of their products i was excited to try the ready to spread frosting as i do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting i am not a picky eater especially if the item contains sugar but this was horrible the consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting it is not light and fluffy it is very gooey i cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey i did not even try it on a cake because the taste and texture were so off putting seriously do not waste your money ,big disappointment , not as good as it is
this product was such a disappointment as all the other reviewers said it is a gluey sticky texture more akin to glue than to an edible food product the flavor was sickening sweet i actually thought that the frosting had spoiled it was that bad save yourself the time and i paid and make your own frosting or go with another brand cake and cookie mixes are so good it is hard to believe they even sell this ,worst ever , not as good as it is
i am glad i found this on the reduced rack for c the taste was not bad but no way i could my cake it stuck to the knife ran down in what a mess i too thought i had gotten a bad batch my birthday cake looks like crap who would buy this mess horrible ,worst ever , not as good as it is
i recently purchased this on sale at my local grocery store now i know why it was on sale br br this is not a fluffy creamy white frosting you would expect to find when opening the jar now i was not expecting it to be just like betty crocker but it was pretty bad like others said it is a gluey mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on it reminds me of taffy that has not quite hit the right stage in the candy making process the taste is not that great either and it is sickeningly sweet even for frosting the only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns i still do not think it would be the right consistency ,kitchen vanilla , not as good as it is
of rubber and since we were in a time crunch we did not have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting so we ahead and a cake with it horrible experience bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever it spread about as easily as chewing gum stuck to everything it came in contact with and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it on top of all this it did not even taste good by the time we were done decorating we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family so we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre made cake our cake which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey was used as a centerpiece a really centerpiece that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried ,do not buy this , not as good as it is
i work in college aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students i used to buy them in the grocery store then learned i could get them for less online for lb bag and thought that was a good deal until i found this great deal ,for all , great product
well worth the money i did the on different bags and this dollar amount is an excellent value there are approx pops in the box so far i have been through about half the box and have found about without wrappers that is pretty good considering if you need lbs of go for this product enjoy ,lots of pops , good
plenty with some brands of canned meats the proportion of liquids to meat was fair too it is not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either though it does all need to be cooked and quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat none of the meat was seasoned at all this is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring there is a mild spam like texture and taste to the meats but way better than spam any day almost a brine or something that is why i heavily seasoned it do not plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats it gave everything a slightly rancid taste no idea why due to the higher calories and higher price i will only stock this as emergency food i will buy more for that reason ,when you have no but want what do you do , not as good as i like
a watered down of the acai berry br br this juice comes on strong and harsh with tart aftertaste and no texture br br that because it is mostly apple juice grape juice pomegranate juice blackberry juice blueberry juice and tart cherry juice oh yeah there is some acai berry juice mixed into this concoction br br you shall not find that distinctive smooth chocolaty acai flavor here there is no milky mouth pleasing texture neither for that exotic unique acai experience try or brands br br i m not saying that this lakewood juice product is not nutritious that is not my point i am saying that it is a juice blend that does not taste anything like the real acai juice ,of taste , not as good as it is
the pasta is firm and it has an excellent flavor br br there are no artificial flavors colors or preservatives the pasta was produced without antibiotics synthetic hormones or pesticides br br this pasta is simple to make and it has a wonderful texture there are servings per box oz each serving contains cal g fat sat g fat mg mg sodium g carb g fiber g sugars g protein br br however the cheese is not exactly sufficient even when you add the butter milk or yogurt to add that wonderful rich smooth cheese flavor that accompanies mac and cheese you will have to add your own organic cheese br br the cheese packet falls flat on flavor and it does not contain a sufficient amount to coat the pasta i give this mac and cheese a on packaging for maintain organic integrity on texture and a for flavor ,organic whole wheat white cheese oz , not as good as i be
if this flavor lasted longer than it does i would probably die of for lack of wanting to take it out of my mouth ,the flavor of the , great taste
this gum is super sick are flavor is a this brings back bomb memories yo peace out ,gum of the , great taste
my husband and i were very disappointed in this coffee very weak watery cup of coffee a definite waste of ,not much in this brew , good coffee
commercial brand that is widely available bluegrass starts is flat in the middle then ends with a complex interesting flavor kikoman is less salty initially and has a round full flavor in the middle does not have the complex flavors for me the initial saltiness of bluegrass is a minus and kikoman full middle flavor is a plus i kikoman especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct but i lived in japan for many years and am used to the standard japanese flavor i have not tried bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor which is how soy sauce is usually used br bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite if you want a unique kentucky gift for an asian friend this is different than the standard bottle of bourbon or box of chocolate ,good soy sauce but not special good as unique gift , i love it
i watched an o how things are made on and saw bluegrass soy sauce featured on a whim i ordered a bottle it took several weeks to arrive but when it did what a surprise my teenage son wanted to try it and did he loved it immediately now he puts it on many things my wife and i were very pleasantly surprised and liked it very much in the past i made many trips to the far east and developed a real liking for soy sauce where virtually all of it is made what a treat to find a handmade american product that with and wins against a japanese chinese national staple ,what a surprise , not as good as it is
my bottle arrived just in time for a sushi dinner and game night planned with friends i had three soy sauces to choose from after some sampling we were all using the bluegrass everyone enjoyed the light smoothness a subtle sweetness we were right on every piece rather that dipping friends wanted to know where i found it i am going back to order more right now and i will be ordering extra bottles because they are going to make a great little gift that is affordable and unique instead of the traditional bottle of wine that so common it is boring ,gets my , great product
if you enjoy the flavor of soy you will really like this br br plus its hand made in the good ole usa ,and i though was good , great taste
i recently acquired a bottle of this and was immediately impressed it has good flavor without all the excessive saltiness of supermarket brands i have used it for marinades and dipping sauces in addition to straight use and in all cases it has added a little something extra quite a surprise to find an american made soy sauce that tastes this good ,better than in the , not as good as it is
this soy sauce is the best we have ever had thanks to amazon we were able to find it again it makes a big difference when using this product thanks again ,best soy sauce ever , best sauce ever
this is the most delicious soy sauce i have ever tasted i will surely order it again such deep flavor ,great sauce , delicious
saw this on how it is made which was a very interesting process br decided to give it a try i really enjoy the flavor it adds br looking forward to trying it on several more dishes br thanks to those who brewed it ,outstanding product , not as good as it is
most soy sauce is from japan but they are having problems with in their soy bean fields i am not sure how long the contamination will last i like the idea this product claims no gmo seeds you pay more but decided not to take a chance on japan ,non , best ever
i am pleased with these was not sure how they would be able to the classic flavors of caramel apples but figured werther was a good bet i am diabetic so down a real caramel apple when the mood just cannot happen as often as i would like to do so but these are tasty enough to get me through until i can carb budget the real thing these are made with sugar so it is wise to limit how many are eaten in a day unless you are going to be near home and have flush on your this pack of will last a while but they are definitely a will reorder ,amazingly true to flavors , not as good as i be
this item werther sugar free hard candy if consumed will give you or your friends loose i purchased bags and discovered more than a bowel problem you cannot return them need a laxative i have ten unopened bags you can have for free ,it is a , the best
this is a bold blend that has a great taste the flavor comes bursting through i usually brew drink organic sumatra from bj i use this blend exclusively so to get a cup that the complex flavor from my tassimo brewer is fantastic come on amazon add it to the subscription service ,good tasting cup o , great coffee
we have tried many tassimo flavors this is by far our favorite our normal cup of coffee is starbuck house blend out of a cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our tassimo this coffee is rich but not too stong i do not understand the current price over for and hope that it will be lowered on amazon for now we will buy elsewhere ,best of the , best coffee ever
this is one of the best choices in my opinion i also adore amazon but they need to a better price for their tassimo these are available at beyond for and i always get off which brings it down to they were before the off readily available coupons until about months ago again this is an excellent blend with full flavor not bitter i think it is my favorite ,great coffee terrible price , great coffee
i have tried about of the available t discs and the kona blend is one of the best regular unflavored coffees for tassimo it has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering and has a pleasant aroma personally i would enjoy it more if it were stronger bolder however being a bit mild it goes well with breakfast and or gluten free baked goodies i find it mildly that this product is not available from nor is a subscription service available originally found this at dead from beyond used a coupon and was happy with the final price ,one of the better t , great product
carefully at the photo of the disc you can see that information and there is a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description so it is my fault for not reading more carefully but i was happy to see what i thought was kona and was not careful i have bought the kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the tassimo discs but i just read the product title and ordered br br as i said the coffee tastes good the amount of coffee is the usual amount neither the small cups of some european coffees or the extra large size and i would recommend the coffee just be aware that this is blended coffee with only kona and do not expect it to come in a as it did when amazon prime delivered it ,rating both coffee and , not my favorite
of all the coffee available for tassimo this kona has the richest flavor and fantastic aroma by br far my favorite ,kona for , great coffee
i think these are my favorite cookies ever really light and creamy too bad you can no longer find them anywhere for less than two hundred count i do not think i need that many ,best , great taste
this kind of tea not good taste and smell so wear it is not like tea and feel like some thing chemical ,of tea t get it , great tea
strawberry all are delicious though i do not like strawberry chocolate in any candy personally and give those away to eager friends the box are perfect for coffee tables and as a dish at work br br milka and its famous purple cow is owned by kraft is an eastern european chocolate originally produced in and is available in germany and other nearby countries br br is still weak in the united states but can be found in larger usually then it is found only in international grocery stores though it pops up in grocers from time to time it has been around years whether or not kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen for now the texture and taste are better than hershey and nestle it is a smoother creamier basic chocolate br br i fully recommend the milka mix gift box br br br com ,perfect of chocolate , a great for your
i ordered for my dad for day and he ate the whole box within two days br he said it tasted really good now i want to order some for myself haha ,really liked these , great product
great candy and our family loved it it was smaller than i imagined it and i thought it was expensive for how small it was however i am in germany and can get it easier here the shipping to the usa makes it great product and fun for our usa family to receive ,great candy my family loved it , great product
i eat mustard with everything this is hands down the best mustard i have ever tried in fact everyone i tell to try some falls in love with it as well spicy tasty real quality br if you like spicy mustard you will love this ,yummy , great taste
the turned bad in a few days after we received it no other item inside our fridge turned bad ,horrible dont buy it , not as good as
this product works wonders if you have stomach issues i would buy again once i need more ,tea works great , great product
bought this at a local specialty item store because i adore chutney because of the higher price and being sold like a gourmet item i wrongly thought it would be better than the affordable brands sold at the supermarket wrong it is mostly gel jelly with a few fruits sprinkled throughout and tastes like cheap thickened jelly you put on sandwiches i ve had much better and that is just talking about the supermarket brands very disappointed money does not buy quality ,where are the , not as good as it is
our ferret loves this rabbit it is a nice high protein treat in addition to his regular evo ferret diet the price was reasonable compared to our local pet store which does not often have this item in stock ,our loves this , great product
my son made this he did not have the patience to be precise about the water temperature and when half an hour before it was done it appeared not to have at all i for the worse determined to be i agreed to have a sandwich using the bread it was amazing apparently it during the baking or something br br great tangy flavor perfect for a meat sandwich imho and not heavy at all fortunately we had lots of deli meats since the whole loaf disappeared within the hour br br we ve had all but the bread so far i am sure that will be delicious as well ,fantastic , great product
these were great just as described used them for a bee themed party and now we use them as to go packs of honey for our coffee and tea ,great little treats , great for
this is not dust which is edible and made for baking do not purchase this product for such purposes ,not edible , not as good as it is
i was very happy with the quick shipping as i needed it for a school product for my daughter but when it came in the roof was broken and the corner of the house was broken i could not send it back as i needed for a project ,shipping , not as good as it is
small hard candy decorations hazard br br comes with everything you need except bowls an spoons br contains br cookie pieces br large bag yellow colored icing east to mix with just fork you add water slowly as to not get to thin br small white icing bag you add water slowly br green color to add to small amount of white br clear br plastic tips can save to reuse br small candy for decoration hazard br strawberry licorice rope br small tube of orange writing icing br hard candy decoration about diameter br gummy about tall br gummy patrick about tall br br icing set up hard so when you go to eat it has to be apart in pieces cookies do get a little softer in the middle br br make anytime of year leave off and patrick and cut out head so does not look like ,loved making this as easy enough to do by with any can do this , great product
this is not as easy as it looks does not came with enough yellow frosting and the frosting does not stick very well my year old did like making it though ,not as easy as it looks , not as good as it is
money each year with them this one also came broken i order a lot from amazon and things do not come broken i think only one time have i had returned something because it was broken in of orders but two of the same thing in a row i think it is the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped i will say most come ups and overnight comes fed but it is bubble wrapped very well i think the gingerbread is not good and cracks in shipping and breaks off the rest of the kit is very cute the first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box but the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags too bad but i would try something else stay away from this one ,not one but twice came broken , not bad but not bad
i was pleasantly surprised to find this item had been delivered the day after my order my delivery to date it probably helps my location is near everything looks just as described and pictured and i am very happy to have done business with this seller the gingerbread house was carefully packaged as not to harm the fragile pieces inside i am excited to give this item as a gift ,house , great product
these cookies were fun to paint but not too tasty to eat br the kids did not really care much but it might have been br more fun if they could have eaten them br br they really had fun coloring them ,fun to , good snack
i was disappointed in this product because i thought it would be bigger br also it did not come with enough icing i had to use my own ,disappointment , not as good as it
the whole idea of a ginger bread pineapple is really great but the sticker that says use by has a date on it if thats this is not good i think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration but my son is going to want to eat it the least the seller could do is to check the expiration date its right on the front of the box not happy at all ,cute item but , not as good as it is
this tea carries the flavor one would expect from the smell terrible it like a puncture and the only is that after drinking you discover that you are still alive br br well one tea bag was enough for me my mother in law said oh that smells kind of like wine okay kind of like wine with a hint of and a moldy aftertaste if she likes it she can have the whole box ,if i could give a rating one star , not as good as i like
this tea is the best tea i have ever had i first tasted it in and had to find it in the states i have it every morning ,delicious , great tea
i love the aroma and the taste of the fruit and vanilla combo and the addition of ginseng for an added energy boost rounds this tea out nicely for me it is a sweet tea which makes it a wonderful healthy alternative to desert after dinner br br i see that others did not like it but it is really a matter of personal taste different for different horses ,i love this tea to own taste , not as good as it is
the best chocolate in the world in this critic opinion is made in the united states and the best chocolate in the united states is made in california by the ghirardelli chocolate company it is surely the best chocolate that one can find in so many stores etc throughout the united states their actual stores are rare but kroger wal mart formerly and a long list of other grocery stores and many stock their products br br i have never encountered milk chocolates with caramel filling to the quality of these these are chocolates of you can eat them quickly or take your time and savor every moment of eating every one the choice is up to you ,there is , best hot chocolate i have ever had
this is a good quality brand of chocolate with many flavours of which this is just one very tasty and a fast delivery too ,caramel chocolate , great taste
my mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven they did not believe they deserved receiving these but i know they did deserve to receive these ,chocolate heaven , good flavor
this is the best caramel chocolate combination i have ever tasted the caramel is liquid and the ghiradelli chocolate perfectly do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight you will end up an addict like me br the ghiradelli product is far better than the caramello hershey product in every way the caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the ghiradelli squares and the caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste comparing the two is like comparing to myself in terms of unfortunately i am the caramello bar in this regard br at the very least try the ghiradelli ,heavenly , not as good as it is
of course we all know how delicious ghirardelli chocolate is unfortunately after i purchased two of these gift bags online i found them in a local store for half the price lesson learned ,great chocolate , delicious
this chocolate treat is a great gift and it arrived right when i expected it to i gave it to my girlfriend as a surprise gift and she absolutely loved it ,great item , great taste
are people really paying bucks for these chocolates go to any grocery store and by them for a bag wow ,is this , good
low calorie and satisfying these soups are a nice fill in when you do not want too much but do not want to be hungry for a few hours ,yum , good
this was really a disappointment while the products included are fine the real disappointment was the travel mug it is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it so it is basically just a cookie package yeah that is really what i want to use as a travel mug i agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store the product description says the tumbler is definitely a keeper what it is simply cheap packaging not something of quality to enjoy had i known that i would not have purchased the set i really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis i like the products inside and the basket is ok but really this what not what it appeared to be ,overpriced even on box , not as good as it is
it looks pretty but the contents are very minute and seem to not be of very high quality there is a plastic cup for the tea that looks like it came from a dollar store the basket is nice though ,even at seems a little overpriced , not as good as it is
purchased this as a gift for my mother when it was a lightning deal she was very happy and loved the basket she enjoyed the cookies and the flavors of tea that were included shipped quick and arrived when expected ,quick great basket , great product
received very quickly and extremely well packaged since this is a smaller sized basket it would be an adorable present for anyone who likes tea for self or just to have to hand very nicely with attention to detail ,basket makes nice , great taste
these small chocolate cups are a specialty party item that i have never been able to find in the past when i wanted them amazon now provides a link they can be used for what are commonly called jello shots and provide a solid edible alternative to small paper cups ,party item , good but not great
i bought these chocolate liquor cups for a party it was a big hit they are high quality and a good buy ,delicious , good flavor
great for serving chocolate liquor adds a touch of class to your event and you to host being able to eat the cup afterwards is just icing on the cake ,chocolate how can you go wrong , great taste
delicious chocolate cups each in its own aluminum holder i could not find these in any local store so was happy to find them on line br most people are of them so they are impressed when i serve them a little or other liquor in a chocolate cup after sipping the br liquor you can eat the cup what could be nicer excellent product ,chocolate liquor cups , good flavor
strawberry twist has a long lasting pleasant flavor sweet but not excessively so delivery is timely and price is just right to other trident flavors though spearmint is not bad either my next pick would be blueberry ,has a very good flavor , good but not great
trident strawberry twist sugarless gum is very disappointing both in taste and consistency the strawberry flavor is very artificial tasting and though i guess it is a good thing not very long lasting the gum also gets fairly quickly br br i chew a lot of gum but will not be buying this flavor again br br not recommended br br cfh ,odd flavor not recommended , not as good as it is
besides that mentioned in the title the only other i have about it is the price is hard to beat the taste is akin to a strawberry vitamin for those of you that have tasted them and taste lasts for not very long i would say on a scale of to with lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a also the taste really to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time ,good gum with gum for better bubble than other , not as good as it is
i love this flavor and i cant find it on the shelves anymore the gum tasted fresh which is actually way better than when i used to buy it in stores ,great gum , great product
if some other it ok to give give a suck review to this stuff because he does not like the taste i feel i must that in this as in all matters of taste de non est br br i really love this gum ok it does not really taste like strawberry but it is still delicious it has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through but then it gets tired stuff and br br you ll forgive the perhaps when you find as i did that this stuff is a wonderful aid by chewing this product i filled my with room air and so helped me lose in months br br also it does not lose its flavor on the overnight ,delicious and helps weight , not as good as it is
my father could no longer take care of his beloved year old cocker spaniel so i decided to take her into my family when i brought her to she had ear and eye she was also slightly overweight after a check up with a vet that out infection i decided to try royal canin based on the numerous good reviews within a week her ear and eye problems were gone and she dropped a good amount of weight this is going to be the only food that we will be feeding her ,perfect for , great product
our spaniel has tried several foods in her years and this is the only one she will eat by itself without any people food being added of course we still treat her occasionally when we went in for our month tooth cleaning the vet told us to take her home as her teeth did not need any cleaning for another months at least it is designed for their teeth and health needs and she loves it and it is actually cheaper here than at the fancy pet store what more could you ask ,my dog loves this food , my dog loves them
royal canin was recommended for my dog but since this line of dog food is specific to breed it was difficult to find in stores petsmart and petco carried the cocker spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio finding a larger bag has been a great deal my cocker loves the food too ,great deal , great product
this is food especially designed for cocker who have a range of health issues i have been using this product with three of my dogs and all of them are very happy with it it also is packaged very well and as a result stays fresh for a long period of time great product ,great food , my dog loves them
i tired many different dog foods over the yrs i have my cocker spaniel i then came upon this breed specific dog food figured i would try it my dog loves this food and always finishes his food i have used this for over yr now he has not tired of it i have seen a significant change for the better in him he is more active and doing well br br i only buy this brand food for him now br br buster gives it paws up i give it stars ,loves this dog food , my dog loves it
hot spots and she would just lick her fur off all these great changes in a matter of a month i do mix it roughly with naturals dog food blend they are doing great br br sept br i love this breed specific food however i just went to place my next bi monthly order and i am shocked at the price hike in just over a month i paid br on for a lb bag and here it is sept th and the price has is now a difference of in price this is a huge amount to go up considering that i am assuming this is a price due to the over i will look to my local vet for this product i can get a large bag now less at petco as well with the discounts they offer they will order a larger bag if you ask ,happy dogs , my dog loves it
fast and great service my loves this low fat dog food thanks arrived in great condition thank you thank you thank you ,fast and great service , great product
we are chocolate br br our nice owner bought this great food for us we love it very much i have gained lbs because i eat all of food when he is not looking our skin and fur is much better now too ,good food , great product
my year old cocker spaniel loves this food and it is good for him he needs to lose a few pounds and this is doing the trick glad i found it on amazon hard to find elsewhere ,happy dog , my dog loves it
my lb bag of oatmeal seemed like way too much but as time went on i found more and more uses for it i have so many recipes that i make weekly that i am running out this is a very high quality oatmeal and much cheaper and better than anything i have found in the grocery store ,great way to order , good
better than organic oats advertised elsewhere takes lots of water these are not minute oats so my oatmeal cookies come out right not all crumbly and soggy instant oats have their place but not in cookies ,good quality delivered on time edible , great taste
rolled oats is a delicious product i am using them to make a product designed to increase and the milk production in mothers br the oats were shipped to me in a timely fashion and the amazing thing is i only paid shipping for lbs of oats i encourage anyone who likes oats to order rolled oats their flavor is above all the rest ,review for , great taste
nice flavor not too bitter we really like this coffee we have been searching for a coffee that the whole family tastes and this is the one ,excellent , good coffee
the us made version of this cadbury chocolate has a distinct taste from the uk version of the chocolate which i have been eating since childhood i did not like this new taste to all my friends from india buy this chocolate if it is either made in uk or india otherwise you will be disappointed as i was ,very different taste from the made in or made in version , not as good as it is
cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured new zealand is uses more cream than etc this version by hershey is not what you expect from england or new zealand cadbury it does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently br br if you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non hershey version br br hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality cadbury chocolate to usa ,not like other , not as good as it is
my first taste of this tea saved my trip home from when both the hotel and a restaurant had stale powder in the tea bags how i needed my fix a stop with a giant and this chinese breakfast yunnan black tea set me straight br br other reviewers have said it tastes odd the flavor is strong and a bit smoky like darjeeling only like darjeeling or earl grey it has enough flavor on its own no milk or sugar needed but it is expensive by the box of teabags finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic it arrived promptly well sealed and true to the label unlike some loose tea that is actually cut up this has the whole leaves that ,great deal on great tea , not as good as i have
this tea has surpassed all other breakfast teas in this tea drinking household we love it and it really starts the morning off right perhaps it has more caffeine than our old favorites the taste is wonderful without any additions and it will remain our tea of choice in the morning and often throughout the day ,best breakfast tea ever , great tea
a href http www amazon com gp product b x numi organic tea chinese breakfast yunnan black tea loose leaf oz bag pack of a i brew iced tea in the refrigerator by the half gallon with this tea excellent the resealable bags work well and unopened they protect my large stash making it easier to manage my subscription ,great organic tea at a great price , great tea
the taste is harsh as it is a lesser grade of yunnan it is ok to drink but not to really enjoy i only make it for when i am in the hurry and will not be able to fully enjoy my tea anyway ,mediocre but cheap , not as good as it is
i have used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious consistently good quality black tea mainly i use it and several other numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha ,delicious and good quality , great tea
i grew up on yunnan tea as a child it was always my mother favorite so i was happy to find an economical source of it of a quality that was great for a large volume tea drinker like me this tea is my daily regular tea yunnan is nice in that it will brew dark so you do not need much at a time it is aromatic and flavorful without any additives if you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than earl grey this yunnan or a keemun may be a nice option to ,nice flavorful tea for the black tea , great tea
it always me that there are not dozens of reviews here the fine qualities of this tea i have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and i never get tired of it it is an excellent morning tea is smooth without being and is almost impossible to ruin by just use decent water i like a little stevia in it as i am a it brings out the natural sweetness of its slightly floral style i just bought another two pounds ,the best tea , not as good as it is
i hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent i decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste it is flavorful without being overpowering it is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced after the first try i have continued to drink it just as it comes you can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea ,great tea , great tea
i read the other reviews before purchasing am pleased that i did i have purchased other numi teas and gave generally been happy with all of products ,this is a very fine tasting full a great value , great product
to my mind a fine caramel should be creamy and melting these are grainy the flavor on these was fine although a little sweet to my taste ,not creamy , not as good as
having eaten and re eaten my way though all of the caramel range this remains my all time favorite and the one that usually gets the most rave reviews when i share them which is not an easy thing to do just try one and you will see what i mean i have been a caramel fan for ages and while will do in a pinch nothing has come closer to what my mother used to make than these they are chewy buttery and the little of salt are spectacular ok my mother did not put salt in hers this is an improvement ,this caramel is fantastic , not as good as you are
although i did enjoy the other flavor i ordered a tiny bit more the chocolate with walnuts one this was still a very enjoyable flavor wonderful service from including a hand signed coupon for a discount on future orders along with samples of a couple other caramel flavors i would order this or the chocolate and walnut flavor again for sure along with more of food gourmet salt ,great , great product
this is certainly the best caramels i have ever had i just wish it came in bigger pieces i finished the whole box in one sitting i will certainly buy them again ,where has this candy been , great taste
not my idea of a good caramel flavors of ginger and same for the chocolate walnut and orange honey varieties i missed the mix of rich buttery dairy flavor with sugar that i expect in caramels ,not for caramel lovers , not as good as
being an old with a i am pleased when the chemical is what they say it is this is what they advertized ,soda , great product
this baking soda works great for cooking or for health reasons i take it for acid indigestion and heart burn just a tsp in a half glass of water and it is gone i use it to make my body more so it is great for changing your ph level in your body ,aluminum free , great product
i recently started using bob red mill baking soda i am very pleased with it is performance and i can be sure that it is not contaminated with aluminum thanks bob ,this baking soda is the , great product
if you are concerned with an aluminum free product then this is the product for you too bad that baking soda does not in any form contain aluminum this is however a concern for baking powder which can depending on manufacturer contain aluminum save your hard money and buy bob red mill regular baking soda arm hammer is great for general cleaning purposes but for natural beauty and health care this brand is perfect br br just thought you would all like to know i almost fell for it myself until i did a little digging around br br p s so as not to let all of amazon com land feel i am one of those haters who do not really know what they are talking about i love bob red mill co and shall continue purchasing their excellent products ,interesting about baking soda , not as good as i be
would like to see is that the product is packed in a heavy paper while this may be a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight food grade plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag could be either a zip lock bag or a twist tie does not make any difference just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it br br this is a health and issue of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers very expensive and hard to find i am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food long term storage is a big issue with people like me br br ,excellent quality product fast delivery , not as good as i like
i am happy with the quality of the product and the price like the other reviewer i would prefer if there was a plastic liner to preserve freshness however i will continue to buy this product regardless as it is quality oatmeal at a good price br br edit i am on my th bag quality continues to be high ,good oatmeal i am on my second bag , not as good as it is
good quality oats package came on time oats worked well in recipes i will admit as a single person i bought these oats with my boyfriend for breakfast food it lasted us for the year br br otherwise it is an excellent buy ,loved the , great taste
i cannot eat these oats they have a funny taste to them my kids also think they taste funny my husband thinks they are ok so he has pounds of oats to eat on his own ,taste , good
i pocky got once at lucky and couldnt stop its like the chocolate is laced with crack the product is good the only sad thing is that it was shipped or stored in a hot room and the chocolate melted together partially but it didnt take too much effort to take apart the sticks br br great product and great price from this merchant ,awsome , great taste
of the many i made on amazon this past december i was most pleased with the pocky chocolate cream covered biscuit sticks pack of they arrived on time and they were a hit as a surprised gift be sure to keep them ,very happy with sticks , not as good as it is
got these for my kids as christmas stocking stuffers they love them as far as delivery the product came in good condition timely and was terrific definitely a good buy ,these are great , great
that when you open it properly the grabbing side of the stick is right at the top br br each of the packets has calories from fat and about mg of sodium so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option it does contain milk wheat soybeans and so if any of these are an issue for you then you will want to pass it also says on the packaging that the facility they are manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts the product does not use either of them but the is nice if you are particularly sensitive to either br br overall a great snack at a great price the pack really is of the packets so that is quite a few snacks one note if you live in a hot climate do not order them in the summer because they will melt together in shipping ,i love this snack , good but not great
the chocolate on the stick was all melted and all the sticks were stuck with the product and the concept is good but you will be better off buying it from a supermarket or directly get it from someone visiting japan ,chocolate was all , great hot chocolate
first of all i love the packaging making it but it would not have been a problem because i ordered it it winter and they were cold i also want to thank for the free sample of mi it was delicious i now love mi ,this item is awesome , great product
your mouth this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth br br personally i like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor i also have terrible self control so i buy things that come in small portions in order to a not eat everything at once and b avoid making the fridge a mess by it with tons of opened items i can honestly say that i will not be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because i and my stomach dislike it so much i will not change my original rating because that still holds true for the japanese pocky but if i were to rate only the thailand pocky it would be a the taste is not terrible but its definitely not to my liking if possible i will be some pictures of what i received ,great tasting snack if you get the , good product but
bought these for my daughter grad party as well as the strawberry she loves these things they are a great product ,great product , great product
everyone in our family except one really likes the taste of this it is addicting that includes our year old ,delicious , delicious
chocolate together like almond joy try the coconut chocolate ones they are really so good oh man hubby says the taste reminds him of the girl caramel delights cookies which are in turn similar to the old yes yes cookies from the or so br br anyway if you have read or seen with young folks eating those stick looking treats or seen of cute japanese girls at skinny little stick treats this is what they were eating fun treats br br however with this crazy hot summer i would recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall cooler weather you might get a sticky clumped mess of pocky sticks in this deep summer weather look for local stores that in japanese or and they will likely carry japanese snacks like these in south florida has them in a variety of flavors and fresh and not melted ,fun crispy sticks in chocolate special treat for fans but find local or , good for a little
pocky is an incredibly good snack but more than that i was impressed with very asia packaging i had ordered something as easy to melt as chocolate in the dead heat of summer on top of that the package of dessert pocky i ordered in degree weather melted into this liquid goo t t so of course i was expecting all the pocky in my boxes to be melted away but they took the special care to put the pocky in a box reading protect from heat and my pocky arriving in perfect condition well they did stick together just a bit i love very asia more than anything now ,yummy , good but not great
i think the pocky did not get stored the chocolate was falling off from the biscuit stick and does not taste as it should many of them stick together and whenever i want to split them up it just becomes very messy now i need to clean up my desk every time after i have it ,does not taste as it should , not as good as it is
these where great couldnt stop eating them br lowest priced anywhere and will buy even more next time br cant say enough about these they where shipped faster than what i paid to have shipped also br thank you so much ,great buy , great product
i had bought pocky when on vacation and enjoyed it but living where there are no asian stores i have to shop on the internet the guys in the family seem to like it better than the ladies for some reason for a bit of insanity search for pocky commercials on youtube ,good stuff , good but not great
the individual pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped ,sticks , great taste
had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging the picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie but when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter br br i really want to like this company they seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process that is why i have continued to try their products i bought their granola many times always wanting to like it but it is some of the worst food i have ever had the are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more for than people br br all in all i would not recommend enjoy life foods ,really wanted to like these , good but not as good as i like
this was the first peanut free product i bought for my son i thought they were tasty the kids liked them too for some reason they think they are strawberry bars i love the soft texture and the non crumbly state it makes for clean car rides since then they like the apple and chocolate bars the best berry is always left for last amazon has a wonderful price and i just wish it could be a subscribe item ,good berry flavor excellent price , great taste
i have recently stopped eating a number of allergens dairy soy nuts and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions unfortunately these were pretty gross miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry i threw them away i would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free ,the chocolate ones are much better , good but not great
safe the last few times we have purchased the bars all varieties they have been hard as a rock and my daughter will not eat them i have tried them myself and thought i might break a tooth i had them on subscribe and save which i have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat i agree with a previous post i want to love these bars and i love everything the company stands for and actually really like their cookies but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing i hope they address the issue and i will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture a total bummer they were better in the past but something changed with the taste along with their new packaging ,something has changed , not bad but not great
my son with multiple food allergies really enjoys these bars i find that they have a good berry taste they also have a nice ,good berry flavor , great product
i love them not too sweet but just right any allergy free food is great in my book hope non of these ingredients contains corn thats a no no for me too however i dont appreciate the fact that i opened my new box and the cut of it off if the size it less then so should the charge this will effect my decision in buying again i am not a toddler i need a real size bar please ,great taste but size it smaller , great taste
i was extremely when i opened my shipment of enjoy life on the go bars very berry carmel apple and cocoa the boxes are now a plain generic design you know the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper i then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes i still had at home guess what cheaper ingredients next i taste tested and let my year old help he would not eat the new ones and i cannot blame him they are oily and bland i thought enjoy life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good tasting product i was wrong in summary these are way too expensive to be made with low quality unpalatable ingredients ,cheaper ingredients quality , not as good as i be
refer to the picture i posted above the bar is half the size you think it is going to be it is literally a two bite bar very deceptive advertising that and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star my year old son ate one and did not like them i ate one and agreed as did my husband could not give it away everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as i am concerned ,not a fan , not as good as it is
with all the allergies in our family these ended up working out great we do not have any negative reactions to the ingredients and though we do not buy many pre packaged foods these work for on the go our family tried several varieties and i prefer the cocoa bars they are almost like a tootsie roll to me though i cannot eat tootsie rolls so this is a great substitute for that occasional craving my family prefers the very berry bars because they can eat those when they miss breakfast need a healthy snack or my son will take them on his cross country running meets they are very dense and filling not a soft bar and we always eat them while having some liquid to drink at the same time ,perfect size , great product
chicken breasts with potatoes for every meal so when i stumbled upon this at my local whole foods i was very excited to try it br br overall i really like them it is got pretty good texture taste and it is not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box which really is not that big br br i know alot of people complain about the size packaging and i agree somewhat but each bar is an ounce and calories on par with many other breakfast bars i like the berry flavor the best it is the closest to real non specialty flavor i am grateful for these bars because now i can several in my diaper bag and car and know that when i really need a quick snack i will not be left ,pretty good , not as good as i like the
my son has severe allergies this is an item he loves and is a convenience for me i feel good giving them to him and they taste great ,my loves them , great for
tasty convenient bars for people with celiac disease they seem to have gotten smaller over time but the taste and convenience outweigh the reduction in size and the price ,small but good , delicious
if you are looking for a great gluten free snack you will not be sorry you chose this product my favorite flavor is the apple and nut ,you cannot go wrong , great product
this brand of granola bars are really good the very berry are my favorite however the bars are almost ridiculously small yeah we are gluten free so our food is a lot more dense than other food but honestly can we not have normal sized good tasting granola bars they really are tiny so the taste is great but the bar is small ,yummy but small , great product
they are ok but my husband only eats them when we are in car we keep them there for a celiac snack hard to find when around he will not eat them otherwise they are definitely raspberry but are kind of dry br we have never tried any other snack bars so in all honesty they may be the norm i do not know br we do like enjoy life other products br they are gf have no msg or related products or ,be very berry , not as good as you are
great taste great ingredients great texture absolutely delicious they are a little smaller and you may still be hungry if it is for a meal i give one to my year old son for breakfast and he is still a little hungry for more either that or they taste so good he wants more ,highly , great taste
recently diagnosed a gluten intolerant i have been looking for products that allow me to a of my former life these snack bars fit the bill they have the mouth feel of a traditional snack bar and a pleasant tart sweet fruit flavor ,very berry snack bars , great product
my son loves these fruit bars they are smaller than your typical wheat fruit bars my suggestion it to get your child to like these first before you try the chocolate ones now my son favors them chocolate ones more than the berry ones ,great snack , great for
if you want a really good snack bar try these they are healthy and taste as good as any granola bar but without the gluten i buy these regularly ,great bars for gluten free diets , great snack
that colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks then scoop it up and put it in your mouth br br that how disgusting this bar is br br i have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful it has none i have done nutritional for years and watched healthy foods from bad to barely edible to excellent br br this gluten free bar is so bad i want to go to my local grocery store take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store perhaps if there is a trash just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product br br save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else br br enjoy life bars being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth ,absolutely , a great product
my brother bought me a pound of this coffee for christmas he told me that weaver was the original roaster for coffee he eventually split off and started his own roaster well let me tell you the stuff is delicious i have never been to a brand of coffee usually would buy the starbucks lb bag at costco or whatever looked good at trader joes but weavers is in a class of it is own i am to guarantee i can have this stuff delivered to me regularly try it ,fantastic coffee best i have ever had , good coffee
this is the best coffee we have ever had a light taste but very full bodied i was very pleased with the packaging having it resealable keeps it stay fresher much longer and unlike other brands this construction stays intact i must say you wont be with your purchase this is a must buy ,the best , best coffee ever
this is the best coffee we have ever had i run the american in and weaver was by far and away our most popular coffee hundreds of people come to the every day looking for american coffee and they were not disappointed we did a business this year buy it you will be so happy you did ,best coffee , best coffee ever
more than yummy out of the before the flavor and scent began to fade the white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and do not get bitter if for long periods br br i must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the of the flower jewels pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the rd or th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf better packaging might solve this br br if you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells or are entertaining and want a conversation piece then numi tea flower should be on your short list ,beautiful and a pretty good tea too , not as good as it
the first ball worked pretty well it just looked a little beaten up since then half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water all of them do after sitting for a bit if you do not mind the rate of failure the tea itself is pretty good and fairly of being steeped for a long time especially considering that it is white tea ,easily , not as good as it is
numi has a winner here with this tea my husband son and i often share this wonderful tea after dinner it is very pleasant and the reason they love it it does not turn bitter after longer steeping like other teas do ,wonderful tea , great tea
the product is all that it says it is which is why i gave it stars however i do have issues with the product me and my family members cannot take the smell the taste is horrible so i put it in a lotion cream and it on my skin this was a few weeks ago and though i have since changed my sheets the scent is still in my bed ultimately i stopped using it because it made me smell in a way i did not like it smells like an indian spice and while it did not work for me scent wise it may work fine with someone else ,i cannot the smell , not as good as it is
and i have heard all babies like carrots i do not know if they would like it without the carrots i have not seen this one lentils and brown rice in our local stores so i am glad to get it here along with some others we get this one with the subscription of course with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and we are so busy that it is great to get these delivered br br the packaging is excellent i have ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive broken br br ingredients per label water organic apples organic carrots organic brown rice organic lentils organic canola oil br br this has calories protein vitamin a vitamin c calcium and iron br br i m informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult ,our love this one with the the price is , not as good as the
flour not as good as brown rice though br br this is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters add apricot puree and there is really not much one could do to discourage babies after that i recommend this flavor brand br br ingredients per label water organic sweet potatoes organic apricot puree mechanically separated organic chicken organic brown rice flour br br the rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice color br br nutrition per label calories protein vitamin a vitamin c calcium and iron br br this one had the most vitamin a of all earth best jars i have tried i have been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult ,dessert to them but is it enough , this is the best
one for my twin month olds because it has such interesting ingredients particularly the zucchini and the garbanzo beans i like the fact that it is vegetarian yet i believe it has a complete protein since it also has brown rice this list of ingredients looks excellent and it is a green color naturally br br the babies liked it they have liked everything that has carrots br br i have the subscription for this one as i really like the ingredients and the fact that i am giving the babies food that is naturally green br br ingredients per the label water organic corn organic zucchini organic green beans organic brown rice organic carrots organic garbanzo beans organic canola oil br br this has calories protein vitamin a vitamin c calcium and iron i have been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult ,of broken jars great product though , great product
baby loved this one but as he has i had to cut this one out because it is too runny and if i have to move the spoon quickly out of the way of his hands it is all over i think they could use a little less water maybe a little more potato to make it more the consistency of the turkey dinner one ,good flavor too runny though , great product
spot with apples with turkey you can add cranberries if you want to take it to the next level i just cannot find non sweetened and non dried cranberries even at the better food stores br br apples carrots and turkey taste good to my month old growing twin girls babies love carrots since they are sweet to their taste so that made a great addition the whole barley flour the water to give it an acceptable consistency br br the ingredients per the label water organic apples organic carrots mechanically separated organic turkey organic whole barley flour br br in addition to protein and vitamin a it has calcium and iron br br i m very pleased my babies like this food and are being introduced to so many foods through earth best i have been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult ,protein and vitamin a , not as good as i be
my little girl cannot get enough of this i like that it is organic and contains fruit veggies protein and grains in one tasty meal i wish it came in larger portions since my month old always wants jars ,baby says thumbs up , great product
its my daughter favorite first and for me i love that i can get lentils there are not many stage or vegetarian choices ,earth best rice dinner , great product
wow i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars the other say they notified earth best about this in august and they are still selling it without checking or no more earth best for my little guy i am taking my business elsewhere and i am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars they gotta do better than this to get my business ,plastic in the food , great product
daughter does not like a lot of baby foods but will eat this one as other reviewers have stated it is a bit runnier that other eb stage foods so i add some oatmeal to it it is also a bit bland so i add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up as an added bonus it works wonders for her digestive tract she had problems with constipation for about months sometimes going up to days before we had to give her a and then i discovered that this food makes her poop every time i also started giving her a cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber i rated it instead of stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken i wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein ,my baby favorite nd food so far and great for , not my favorite
this is my son favorite dinner best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein vitamin a and c it is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it love love love this brand and flavor i think i purchased jars so far ,favorite dinner , great hot chocolate
i do not know how everyone else got these broken but when i received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap not a single jar was broken my son loves them and the price was great and i had no issues at all ,no issues , good for you
would be a quality product if it were not so thin nearly the consistency of soup it just makes too much of a mess no matter how careful you try to be ,too thin , not as good as it is
i would love to say that i have the time to make my son food everyday its not the case honestly i do make it most of the time but some days you just do not have the time energy to get it all done enter this product before i bought this baby food i read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it its like a dessert yadda yadda yadda the truth is is that yes it has a bit of fruit in it but its not sweet at all the fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you do not have to add anything else its a great product to enter proteins into baby diet the consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal to it also baby will not choke on it i highly recommend ,a great to start , i love it
we love earth best organic baby food but this is not the tastiest one i have tried it myself and think it is pretty gross but my daughter still eats it just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors it is got a decent amount of protein which is important for us as a vegetarian family ,good for you but not best flavor , great product
soft smooth texture my little one devours this one it is one of the best meat veg dinners we have found ,a favorite , good coffee
my will not eat this one who will eat anything the consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon ,runny and odd tasting , not as good as
my baby loves sweet potatoes i can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what i wanted to mix in there it was horribly runny like formula into his mouth ,too runny , great product
proteins but she did love this one the flavor is just right not too sweet or too savory and does not have a strong chicken flavor almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp thus it is a very good first protein to offer and good for picky eaters my and my niece also liked this flavor so it is a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you do not know a particular baby preferences br something i wish i had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other stage earth best especially for having chicken i added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture and she liked that just fine but it is an extra step however the runnier texture makes it for younger babies or those with texture problems ,great taste for a picky baby but very thin compared to others , great product
this is the only food my daughter will eat she really enjoys it the packaging is great never had any broken having ordered times ,great stuff , great product
my son loves the rice and lentil jars it is not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars i have it on order with subscribe and save amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged ,son loves it , great product
i have twin girls they both loved the vegetable turkey dinner it was one of their favorite baby foods great price ,love it , great product
i normally love earth best products as does my son however tonight after i would given him half the jar i thought i would try some since it was a new flavor and i realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it i was as this is my first child and i do not have any experience with this kind of thing i called poison control they said he would be ok and once i knew he was fine i got really angry i looked it up online and found that earth best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it do not buy earth best really disappointing ,found plastic in the baby food , great product
my son really enjoys earth best lentil he eats the entire jar for dinner and always wants more the product shipped very quickly ,my son loves it , great product
i introduced my daughter to earth best organic turkey vegetable dinner at months a bit early but she is advanced as she was weeks she loved it at first but i bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite i have tried some of it as well of all of them this is also my least favorite ,meh my daughter most everything else this is not thing , great product
we received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today i always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature i put them in a bowl and microwave for seconds and taste ok when i tasted this i made a face because it was so yucky i added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon to her credit my month old daughter ate some bites but not nearly as as the other flavors i like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein ,not as yummy as earth best other flavors , not as good as it is
i love the fact that there is turkey being offered this is my son nd favorite dish no issues with it and a good balance of nutrients ,son nd favorite , great product
only three jars came in a form edible to babies the rest of them were filled will a clump of mush that would not mix with the water it also had a brown color and not the brown like the jars that had the good mixture br pretty disappointing and a waste of money ,had to out of jars , not as good as it is
this is one of my son favorite baby foods it does have a bit of sweetness but not too sweet it is more runny than some of the other flavors so we use a deeper spoon with this one or add a little rice cereal to thicken it up ,one of our favorites , great product
for whatever reason our son really likes this flavor i am not a fan myself but i am not the one eating it any time i can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting i am a happy mom ,our baby likes it , great product
the rice and lentil dinner is our son absolute favorite i do not know why but he gobbles this up every time he enjoys most of the earth best foods and we have only found a couple he does not eat anything with too much apple which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar ,our baby favorite dinner , great product
my month old absolutely loves this one by far it is her favorite jarred baby food i like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food and i am not ready to introduce her to meats yet br br i do subscribe save which brings the price down to jar that is a fair price not an amazing deal but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store the bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find i have to go to whole foods my regular grocery store and target carry earth best but not this blend my daughter likes it so much though that i would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices it is a good one ,my daughter favorite food , great product
i always try the food before i feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good my daughter loves it she gets all excited when i make it for her ,yum , great product
solid food he was so picky we tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he would actually finish the whole jar i did not expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it but i guessed it wrong br now he is month old and he is a pretty healthy eater his current favorite seems to be tofu but he still loves corn zucchini brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this i highly recommend to try this baby food br br also earth best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well my son does not really like any snacks from gerber brand but he likes most of the products from earth best their foods taste great even for us adult and so good for you too ,the only baby food my son ate , great product
little baby picky will only eat this sometimes this one is more watery than the others so keep that in mind reviewing baby food is since all children are different so i hope letting you know the consistency and texture help ,a little more watery than other nd foods for , great product
this tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too he is constantly his face around every time we pop open one of these there is absolutely nothing bad to say about these i know some people have complained about the poor packaging but i believe that must have been fixed b c i have not had any problems at all in fact they securely bubble wrap these then place them in an air box and it all arrives perfectly every time ,calories of , great product
i have month olds and no time to write a great review but they like all the flavors the textures are great and the jars open easily great on the go snack ,organic and tasty , great snack
my son started eating this when he was around months old he is now months old and it is one of his favorites unfortunately they do not carry it at the local grocery store they carry other varieties of earth best just not this one or his other favorites spinach potatoes and spaghetti with cheese they do carry it at some of the whole foods so i buy them there i am so glad to find them on amazon i get tired of up a little jars at the store br br we use this as a base and mix in other things bits of cooked broccoli small pieces of meat i have also started adding spices to introduce him to new flavors ,one of my son favorites , great product
my baby loves rice and lentil and is one of her favorite things to eat if we are going somewhere i will not be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold ,great , great product
my daughter loved this stuff it is all natural and made very well good to mix with other things as they get older too beats gerber ,they make the best baby food , great taste
my daughter is baby food but will still eat this we tried rd foods on her and she does not like the texture of them this is really good for her and she likes it so we keep buying it ,a favorite , great for
my son loves the best earth baby food and his favorite seems to be the vegetable and turkey he smiles at every mouthful br br i would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way all the food i feed my son is through earth best ,product , great product
to be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible up all night screaming from gas pains garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies ,the beans in it give horrible , not as good as it is
i usually make my baby food it is so easy steam fruits veggies and puree but sometimes i do not have enough time to cook and i buy earth best baby foods baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but did not like this one she refused to eat it when i tried it i understood why i would not eat it myself either it tastes nasty my poor baby immediately i made her a homemade potato zucchini asparagus puree and she loved it i would not recommend this flavor ,baby did not like it , great product
my six month old baby loves the earth best nd sweet potato chicken dinner it is his favorite he seems to love all the earth best nd foods fruits vegetables and dinners the consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat not too thick not too thin ,my baby favorite dinner , great product
this is my daughter most favorite baby food by far this is the only ones she will eat and rarely will eat the other kinds however the taste is very bland for me as an adult at least after you put the portion in the fridge it may become sort of watery at which point i throw it out it is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has especially zucchini br i had to update my review today because i saw little pieces of thin plastic in two jars of this baby food plastic in baby food i notified earth best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing but i am not giving my baby this food any more even though she likes it that is it for us ,baby loves it but there is plastic in it , great product
the earths best he eats the most this one is a little thicker than his original chicken sweet potato favorite which is very runny ,baby likes this one , great product
i would continue to buy but i am moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars too many they like all the flavors though great textures too ,organic and tasty , not as good as it is
i did not eat any but my baby liked it she said it was savory but sweet and it reminded her of fine dining in tuscany also i like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste i just learned this and am telling everyone only glass forever and if you do not recycle then you and i have nothing in common and you should stop reading here it is not even a hard thing to do anymore nobody else in my building and it drives me crazy you just rinse it and put it in a different and still put it out on trash day stop being lazy ,my baby liked it , not as good as it is
i just wanted to post here that i found small bits of plastic in this food as i was feeding my month old plastic in food baby food so please be careful if you buy this or are considering it br br my daughter loves this food it is actually her favorite this is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over months ,and beware of plastic in the food , my cat loves it
pretty good product the taste is not the best but it is definitely not the worse either it gives a pretty smooth energetic kick ,energy , not as good as it
i am a true seattle coffee addict and i have never had a better coffee candy ,the best , great coffee
sent this basket to my father for his birthday he said the fruit was very fresh and sweet happy with this healthy purchase ,tasty fruit , great product
this fruit gift really was the perfect gift everything was fresh well packed and tasty looking and the people that received it assured me that it was quite tasty tasting too and tried the chocolate covered cherries ad was surprised at how delicious they were so thank you i needed something in a pinch and it came even earlier than expected so thank you again san francisco ,beautiful fresh and it came , delicious
i got it for my girlfriend for her birthday the fruit actually tasted fresh and yummy i love dark chocolate so i loved the dark chocolate almonds next time i will give the organic version of this product to someone close so they share with me ,fresh fruit dark chocolate , good
as a child my memory was drinking sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my i have never seen it in a tea bag before i found that to get the taste i remember i needed bags per cup the bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that i will buy again and again plus the shipping time was great ,tea bags , great tea
i grew up in and lived in the woods where trees were plentiful i would dig tender roots or bark a few trees for a delightful tea i purchased morning tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product not a good bargain i switched to extract ,tea , great tea
i ordered this on line and received it in just a few days the tea is excellent and the price was right for me ,good tea , great tea
i purchased this tea for my neighbor as a present she has been looking for sassafras tea for a long time i did not realize it was so hard to find she absolutely loves it made a great surprise christmas gift ,hard to find tea , great tea
i heard some great things about sassafras and wanted to try it i was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated i am actually gonna order the pack and continue drinking it over time do not trust the fda ,better taste than i expected , not as good as it is
bought this for my dad for about years he would complain to be about how he has not had this tea since he was about finally after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed i bought him the tea so he would shut up ,lovely , great tea
i started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form after several weeks of i called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea i was told is was sassafras concentrate i looked online and found it at amazon com as i was ordering it i also saw the sassafras teabags i thought i would order a box to try i was very dissapointed it did not taste like the flat i was expecting it was more like black licorice which i hate with a very mild undertone it also did not have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root br br i ve never had real sassafras tea made with the root so i do not know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not bottom line i will not buy the teabags again ,k , not bad
great tasting tea i have been looking for a good sassafras tea forever finally i will be ordering this product again br thanks d ,great product , great tea
i did not care for this product at all i thought it was the same tea my sisters and i use to drink when we were in school i found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree ,tea , great tea
i purchased this because i read that it was a natural cure for hives um how about not it did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful luckily a co worker of mine loves this stuff reminds him of his grandmother and i gave it to him yucky yucky stuff ,the most awful taste , not as good as it is
you prefer the unsalted variety which can be hard to find br br one thing to keep in mind though is the expiration or best by date for example if you order these in april and the batch you receive has a june use by date it may be a stretch to consume the bags before the seeds start going rancid on you since they are roasted in oil and unsalted these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety even if refrigerated upon receipt br br amazon does not seem to specify use by dates for the food products they sell so it is a for the i am assuming that amazon will not ship stuff that has expired but they probably ship out the oldest stock first and the use by date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice ,these are good but , good but not as good as i like
i love panang curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it so decided to try making my own and with this product i get exactly what i want hot tasty panang curry adding lots of fresh veggies tofu and brown rice and it is very hot did not have to add any spices at all great product will purchase again ,great product , great product
i purchased this for a friend who loves to cook only to find out that i paid times more than what i should be for cans is highway robbery now that i know that i can purchase one can for around now as far as the item itself this brand of panang paste is excellent the beef panang dish my friend made using this paste was as good as the ones in the thai restaurant i would recommend the paste but not the price ,great paste but way overpriced like more , not as good as it is
best paste i have tried so easy to use just saute you meat add veggies paste and a tin of coconut milk quick and tasty i am on weight watchers and tried using the light coconut milk instead of the full fat it works for the panang paste especially if you add a heaping tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter but the yellow green and red are spicy and need the full fat coconut milk to balance it out ,so easy to use , great product
omg i would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal is not even a strong enough word a horrible horrible mistake an expensive mistake they advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why i bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when i just wanted plan peanut butter cookies however when i received them i found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but i thought okay i will try them and omg i almost threw up from the taste horrible horrible medicinal taste do not buy if they had a zero before the stars i would rate it a zero instead of star ,omg do not buy , not as good as i like
this gravy mix is excellent except do not use water where called for use milk instead and it makes it better ,wonderful gravy , great product
nothing easier nothing better even beats grandmother white gravy recipe already peppered for you you do nothing but mix it with water takes only a minute or two i highly recommend this gravy mix it will not disappoint ,best white gravy , best popcorn ever
i have used pioneer gravy for a number of years it is very easy to make and tastes great also goes very well over mashed potatoes meats etc try it ,gravy is great , delicious
its great to be able to get sugar this way its not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your body and i am helping the fair trade farmers it is a good thing all around i am happy i can get it in amazon ,sugar , great product
so i thought i would give this a try both my wife and i were pleasantly surprised with the taste i do not think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable i bought my first pack at my local grocery store for about that seemed a little high but i figured i would check online to find the best price as i started all of the online prices they are charging about bucks for the count i would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper so you do not have to do the math per single online price shipping not calculated in looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier you can get a case of boxes for no sales tax and free shipping sounds like a great deal x singles so per single the most expensive at all ,more expensive , not as good as i be
i do not think these coffee bags are as good as fresh ground fresh brewed coffee but they taste far better than instant coffee at work we have a water cooler with hot water dispenser this brewed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee i highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but do not have access to a coffee maker individual wrapped and sealed bags allow you to take one tiny tea like bag with you in your pocket or purse to your early morning ,very convenient and far better than instant coffee , not as good as i like

of many years since i did not know how many cups a day i would use i wanted to avoid the fuss of a coffeemaker i do not particularly like instant coffee i was delighted to find these folger bags br br they brew a very nice tasting cup of coffee i am not any kind of coffee expert so i do not know what special terms might be used all i know is that if i let the bag for a bit more than a minute it sure tastes good thanks to my very much better half i have also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffee br br very convenient very easy very tasty i intend to take some of these with me when i travel as an alternative to the in room coffee makers or vending machines br br ,an excellent cup of coffee and easily , great coffee
we cannot have any kind of coffee maker at work so we are forced to buy at the in house coffee shop or starbuck across the street in this economy no one wants to pay those high prices so we started a coffee club of us buy these coffee bags and separate creamer and enjoy fresh hot tasty coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices thanks folgers ,very convenient , great coffee
these are great for at work just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee this is the best tasting coffee it is easy to make without a mess ,great taste , great product
fast easy and definitely delicious makes a great cup of coffee and very easy to make good purchase will continue to order from here br ,delish , great coffee
i gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit and i am glad i did it has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma it has a nice reddish color this tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea i have had and i look forward to experiencing any of the health benefits of rooibos that i have read about ,new to tea , not as good as i like
i tried this before having normal red tea so i waited to review the flavor still rings in my head it is than rooibos tea and less the color is that of muddy water and it has the and of it as well well worth every penny ,tasted better than loose leaf , great tea
i previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price i decided to give pure matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive the quality of pure matcha products surpasses that of all others i have tried stays fresh has a consistent texture and tastes great both the quality and price are better than others that i have purchased for the same quantity i highly recommend pure matcha and will continue to purchase ,best quality and price , great product
this is the very best marinade you can buy as far as i am concerned of course everyone to his or her own tastes but all in all i think anyone will like it i give it five stars ,the best , great product
this is a great product for those looking for an msg and gluten free product and is also lower sodium than any other marinade or soy sauce out there it does not compromise of taste either i use it as a soy sauce substitute and have found it to have superior taste and it looks and acts just like any good marinade should if you are celiac or gluten intolerant or even just watching you salt intake this product is a way to have your steak and marinade it too ,gluten low sodium and msg free , great product

so far i have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing my and i use them nearly daily and i just picked up more it goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick br br the sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears it is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use we love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice ,best all around hot sauce , great stuff

this sauce is so good with just about anything i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles it has a good burn with a strong flavor im hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon buy it you wont regret it ,this sauce is the , great hot sauce
not hot at all like the other low star reviewer i got by seeing habenero in the name and the oz size some people might like the flavor citrus y and it has some fish sauce in the mix according to the ingredient label but if you are looking for hot this is not it ,not hot , not as good as it is
i have to admit i was a sucker for the large quantity oz when shopping for hot sauces but now seeing the size of the bottle it reminds of wing sauce bottle sizes plastic bottle it does have a convenient squirt top but overall not very hot or tasty and made mostly from jalape ntilde os if i had seen the ingredients list i would not have bought it br br water br vinegar br brown sugar br lime juice br fish sauce br cilantro br habanero br garlic br spice blend br salt br potassium br xanthan gum ,not hot not , not as good as it is
i never in my life tasted such a good babka its crazy good this is the real babka that my gram mother use to make ,best , great taste
i am so convinced these are human animal crackers they look and taste exactly like human ones yes i tasted it and they contain sugar which is not one of the last ingredients in the nutrition facts either so ill just give my dog very small amounts ,my dog loves these but , great product
i have a whole box of peanut butter dog cookies and she wont touch them she loves these and begs for them so it was a good buy she is a little and they are not too big for her mouth about per box ,loves them , great treat
these little animal crackers taste good my doggies like them but i will not be buying again they are like the human animal crackers have flour sugar other bad stuff for dogs i will continue to buy the healthy treats for my doggies which they also love without sugar you might want to try wellness blue buffalo natural balance zukes just to name a few ,not healthy but they taste good , good for you

i purchased these little treats as stocking stuffers for our little friends both loved these treats we had to finally buy more since they liked them so much ,the puppy dogs love them , great treat
these are just like the animal crackers we eat the price is great and my little guy loves them ,a great price , great
the smell at first was just like a bed of fresh roses even though the rose content is very minimal i found the smell overwhelming i did not like that this brand of spices does not have a seal in place and only a on lid there is no shaker lid either you open it and it i am how only a few minute pieces of roses could produce such a perfume odor i hope it is not chemically enhanced with the lid being loose and not sealed i have doubts about the safety of the product ,smells like but no or , not as good as it is
time and shipping was charged for both items even though they arrived in the same box there was not even anything fancy about the packaging br br edit okay these actually bother my stomach a little after one truffle the package was not shipped with an ingredients list and i had to go to the company site directly and find a well hidden and hard to follow ingredients page to discover there is a lot of ingredients including high fructose corn syrup for a box i expect no corn syrup i also do not expect propylene glycol in vanilla which i expect to be vanilla beans and not artificial which sometimes comes from the of i am disappointed in the ingredient quality br br http www com ingredient info br br review goes from stars to i would make it but the extra star is because they are quite delicious ,delicious goodness , good but not as good as you are
ive been craving some jerky for a while so i gave this one and some others on amazon a try this one was very and a little too sweet for my taste not going to buy again im still on my search for the salty dry version im after ,a little too sweet , great taste

owe it to yourself to try one of the many other from amazon or better yet single boxes from a local health foods store if you have one and see what you prefer i eat the bob red mill product available on amazon and one of my local grocery instead of this and am much more satisfied i have not tried but i am not crazy about the idea of the fruit flakes and the products are too fruit and nut heavy for me the other products are a hair more expensive than the but i am willing to down an extra or so per breakfast for a far superior product br br i m surprised quaker does not sell a muesli product given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the u s you would think it would be a natural fit for them ,nothing like , not as good as i be
recently purchased this cereal assuming it would contain nothing but healthy ingredients then i read the label and discovered it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup ,contains fat and high corn syrup , great taste
i bought this product online because although it is a kellogg cereal i cannot find a retail store which carries it and incidentally i would like to know why i called kellogg and they could really give me no good answer and suggested i try another product of theirs which i found not as good as this i appreciate that amazon offers this and i will continue to order it by the way it really keeps me regular better than any other cereal try it you will like it ,hard to find product , great product

i ordered the white christmas christmas eve and christmas morning blends last year for the holidays and fell in love with the christmas eve it is the smoothest of the bunch and has such a wonderful flavor i use it for iced teas all year round i can honestly say that i never got into tea that much until i tried stash teas i sent the licorice and lemon flavors to my father and he called me to ask where i would gotten it because his neighbor wanted to get some for his wife too once tried you will be addicted visit the website for lots of tea related bits and these make perfect hostess gifts over the holidays along with a plate of cookies ,best tea ever , great taste
this is my very favorite tea of all i drink it year round and never get tired of it like i do of others it is good any time of the day not too strong but still nicely flavorful with a good balance of minty spicy herbal y ,favorite tea , great tea
christmas eve tea which does not actually contain tea is not just for christmas eve although if you are it does the stress christmas eve is good any time i do not know anyone who does not like it and have often given it as gifts it is especially nice in the winter when mint teas are a little too and do not produce the same level of cozy comfort as christmas eve which is a soothing combination of spices and mint it is almost as comforting as a cup of warm milk but without the calories ,makes everything better , great tea

land where this sugar is grown la sugar cubes are made from african grown sugar more specifically sugar grown in and or the also the cubes are than many sugar cubes i do not know from a scientific perspective how this is but the cubes are not regularly sized but are large and shaped and heavier than cut cubes by other producers br br the flavor is a rich distinct and more molasses y flavor than other brown sugar cubes and is somewhat darker as well i wish i could describe the flavor better but it has been several months since i was able to find a somewhat affordable supply btw now that this product is being sold with free shipping via amazon prime i just purchased several boxes it is a much better deal as of the date of this review than it was a few months ago recommended ,worth the cost to the unique flavor my favorite sugar , best water ever
we love these sugar cubes in the office they are not your grandmother sugar cube they have a appearance can sugar cubes be considered and we combine them with the white sugar cubes from la ,best brown sugar , delicious
love this for the raw sugar cube is not as sweet as the refined sugars and more rich in flavor ,perfect for espresso , great product
it is a good idea to have raw sugar type cubes but this was x the cost of granulated raw sugar ,too pricey , the best
due to my husband and son to eat gluten cornstarch is used very frequently in many gluten free recipes i am very concerned with the use of gmos in corn especially and my family increased consumption of it i wanted to find an affordable gmo free cornstarch product to use in all my baking rumford natural cornstarch is the one i have been using it for months now with great success satisfaction ,product free , great product
to produce so it can be priced with other brands br and still be touted as having been made from with non genetically modified corn br and just on because i cannot afford to throw it away and did not want the hassle of returning it br br i am very very with amazon incorrect listing of the product which was brought to their attention when i purchased it in february and so far nothing has been done br br although calcium sulfate is considered a safe food additive it is basically the same thing as of paris and if you use too much of this product basically the same amount as i had previous used of pure corn starch the very stiff in the bottom of the cooking container i make pudding in pyrex in a microwave and usually stir it only every seconds will remind you of damp ,this is not the product that i received the product may health for some , i love it
if you love garlic i recommend this flavored oil it is true to its name i was not expecting it to be so strong so if i use it for cooking or dipping bread i will mix it with some unflavored olive oil in the future ,very , great product
these things are awesome perfect size truly wafer thin consistent thickness of dark chocolate over minty interior they are like what would happen if you could run a over a mint i first tried them when i was living in germany years ago and to this day no other mint comes close and the ones disgusting go for the original you will not regret it each mint is in its own sleeve so you can pass them out without ever one elegant and delicious love them ,hands down best mint ever , good but not great
love these mints they melt in your mouth and taste better than any others i have tried just wish they were not so expensive you cannot eat just one a couple they are delicious ,the best mint , great snack
i got it for my girlfriend very good stuff now everybody in the house eats them very quality if you are into chocolate and mint ,delicious , great
a friend favorite candy is after eight but they are not available anywhere in my area i could not find them on line either amazon com came through these are imported from england and the most delicious peppermint these are so thin with a smooth mint cream center and a dark chocolate shell if you just want a little taste of mint this is for you really special with a cup of hot coffee ,to find , great taste
might fuss with the dried vegetables in there but they do not specifically target the vegetables to leave behind br br the quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list only one ingredient that animal digest makes me cringe a little the girls do not mind it a bit for goodness alone i can heartily recommend this natural food but the price on it is relatively high ray dry dog food for example is about half the price of farm stands selects and buffalo blue is about the same price for a household like ours with three dogs the farm stands selects is too pricey to feed the girls exclusively we would feel to mix another good but less expensive food with it for those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue i say you cannot go wrong with farm selects ,great ingredients , my dog loves it
you will not find a better loose green tea for the price i was able to get free shipping as well since i bought it with something else that over this is the tea used by many japanese people do not fall for those high priced organic green teas produced by american companies they are good but you are not getting anything better than ban tea ,great price great quality , great tea
this is the favorite green tea in our household been using it for years was happy to find it here on amazon otherwise we had to travel about miles to an oriental grocery store to purchase it cannot even buy any leaf tea of any kind in regular grocery stores any more by the way ban in japan simply means common or everyday tea not ,good , great tea
i love this tea it is so flavorful yet there is no cut grass or off flavor as with some green teas it is so mild that even left steeping it does not become bitter it has a very mellow flavor that my kids enjoy too it great without sweeteners br it is a loose leaf tea and when steeped the leaves long and slender a little tea goes a long way enjoy ,excellent green tea , great tea
i have been drinking this green tea for sometime and was purchasing it when i was going to every summer this year i stopped going there and did not know where i was going to buy my tea until i spotted it on amazon and purchased it i was so pleased that i could get it so i am now a happy camper once again ,enjoyable green tea , great tea
this is the real deal loose green tea and roasted brown rice not in bags originally known as the peoples tea for those who could not afford better very popular because of its mild flavor you can drink it all day long like i do you will not be disappointed ,excellent , great tea
g is the way to go when you want the benefits of gatorade without quite so much sugar as i am in a pre diabetes state these days i am drinking this type of gatorade instead of the regular gatorade which has noticeably more sugar in it the really good thing is that this still carbs and electrolytes after i exercise without putting unnecessary extra sugar into my system br br g comes in flavors including fruit punch and grape br br if you are on the go the advantage of these bottles of gatorade is this because the bottles are smaller you can carry them with you much easier than if you took the regular larger size bottles of gatorade g br br i highly recommend this drink if you need extra carbs or electrolytes after exercising it them very well without the extra sugar found in regular gatorade ,an excellent alternative to regular , not good but not great
all my fault i thought this would be a carton of boxes of cereal instead it was box of cereal for who sells cereal for this price plus shipping i feel stupid buyer beware ,cereal , great product
this is not jerky this is processed hard like a rock very greasy and stale smelling of something that you cannot break into anything smaller than inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat the dogs lb dogs that will eat anything were not impressed it was hard to chew and it sounded like they were crunching rocks most of them it out after a few chews left it there this would be the first time they would not eat something in their entire lives these dogs will work for lettuce where is a zero star button ,awful , not as good as i be
i ordered both the beef and turkey flavors my dogs would not even take these in their both flavors were very dry and had no real aroma to them try a small quantity first i donated the entire order to the humane society ,no , good but not great
this does not on the product but my took them and left them laying on the carpet normally with chicken or turkey snacks they go nuts i donated both containers to the humane society i would try a smaller quantity for a first order ,not for my dogs , good
this is not jerky this is processed hard like a rock very greasy and stale smelling of something that you cannot break into anything smaller than inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat the dogs who will eat anything were not impressed it was hard to chew and it sounded like they were crunching rocks where is a zero star button ,awful , not as good as you are
my partner is very happy with the tea and is feeling much better since starting to drink it br she has been drinking it both hot normal and iced chilled and likes the refreshing nature of it ,it is awesome , great tea
this tea won an in the usa and i know why mandarin silk loose leaf oolong tea is like the name suggests silk silk on your tongue a tea that has a warm relaxing taste that makes you feel wonderful well done art of tea ,awesome , great tea
in they had shipped the coconut creme and mistakenly it with this mandarin silk tea by accident i contacted amazon and they refunded the silver needles and told me i could dispose of the mandarin silk oolong as i saw fit well since i am never one to turn down tea i chose to dispose of it by well drinking it br br this is not a bad tea first off i do not have too much experience with but i do like the flavor of this however i do not taste too much of the mandarin it almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea and it has a similar light green yellow color i drink it with a little honey br br all in all it is a decent tea i do not think i will order it again but i will certainly finish off this tin ,it is decent , not as good as it is
these are identical to jay hot chips are they made by the same company they have a slightly sweet taste with a nice bit of heat definately not overwhelming heat on a heat scale of i would give these about a regarding the texture these are not kettle cooked chips so they do not have much crunch they are comparable to regular lays chips for about a bag they are a great deal ,good taste just enough heat , great chips
i first had these uncle ray chips a few years ago while traveling out west i them down on amazon and recognized the name they are just as good as i remember smoky sweet with just enough kick and there is adequate seasoning on all of the chips each bag also has a little story of uncle ray that usually has some moral message or they are pretty funny but not intentionally my only problem with these chips is their texture they are a bit thin and there is not much of a crunchy texture otherwise these are good chips and well worth trying out ,great taste okay crunch , great chips
i am from michigan but have a vacation home in canada i have always been a fan of the primarily canadian product ketchup chips uncle rays is a brand i have seen around there frequently since this is such a hard to find product i expected to pay big bucks to buy it online imagine my surprise when i found these chips on amazon for a little over a dollar a bag cheaper than the retail i would pay in canada unbelievably delicious ps the dill pickle chips are really good too ,deal on a hard to find , great chips
mine came with stickers to sell them for but they cost more like so if for retail that is not much of a mark up i bought these for myself so that does not really matter and they are cheap similar to lay but cheaper unlike other these seemed to taste fresher and the convenient size stale chips great product great price ,no more stale chips cheap , not as good as it is
i am not a potato chip addict but sometimes like them as a snack br br i chose these because i would never tried them before br br they are delicious zesty slightly sweet and spicy it like a combination of sweet and tart at once the oils in these chips are better for health it is hard to put the bag down br br they are made in michigan and contain no trans fats that is good enough for me try them ,and , not as good as you are
these are some of my favorite chips on the planet they are light crisp not too greasy the flavor is very love that great chips just hard to find ,sooo good , great chips
these chips are really good they taste better than other name brands they are cheaper too they are not too salty like other brands the flavors blend really well just the right amount of sour cream and onion flavor with a little salt mixed in once i start eating them it is hard to stop lol br br i will definitely be buying these potato chips rather than another name brand not sure if i can state the name brand or not ,these are good , great chips
bags of chips were open when i received the shipment i am hoping that the chips were br blew open during shipment in flight no more chips for me through amazon otherwise br the chips are good to eat and very salty ,open bag of chips , great chips
not as thick as kettle chips we have had in the past definitely more like a potato chip and the college crowd loves it enough they feel more gourmet when eating these the flavor is not heavily garlic while you can easily taste the cheese ,gourmet , delicious
we have ordered uncle rays bbq chips many times before always been pleased except this order just not the same br seasoning as usual generally lacked much for taste not sure if they have reduced the seasoning in their processing but out of case we bought we have opened and thrown away bags already very disappointed with this order ,without much taste , great chips
i have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since i was a kid and spent my summers at my in canada this is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available i recently got back from a trip to where i ate at least a pack a day i decided i really wanted some around and was happy when i found these on amazon unfortunately the flavor is nowhere close to the brands i have tried before there is a sort of smoky barbeque sauce thing going on not that they are as good as bbq potato chips which i love they just do not taste like ketchup i tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me then just threw them all out yuck ,these sure do not taste like to me , great taste
i thought they were very good chips delicious and as soon as i run out i will be ordering more very soon ,great chips , great chips
after reading all the good reviews on these chips i have to admit i was disappointed perhaps i just ended up with a bad batch but i could barely taste the vinegar and there seemed to be far too many burnt and i mean black chips in these bags hopefully the other flavors are better but i am going to stick with other brands from now on ,where is the vinegar , great taste
these are hard to find but worth the trouble very tasty and very reasonably priced love the product and received very quickly ,potato chips , good
i love uncle ray potatoe chips they have alot of spice on each chip they taste spicy with a tang of sweet when i order a box i pass them out to friends who love them my husband my kids and i eat a whole bag at a time i limit myself to ordering only twice the salt content makes me blow up but i still love them ,chips , great taste
i love old dutch ketchup chips but they are no where to be found in the us and pricey on i tried but they were dull very but not the tangy ketchup bite that old dutch has makes your mouth hurt in a good way if you eat too many uncle rays are decent more of a kick many loaded chips which i like still not the addictive bite i love so if you love these may be too much for you if you love old dutch give these a shot i am still on my quest for something equal to old dutch ,not quite old but much better than , great taste
were out of the salt and vinegar which is the only flavor i eat i had never even heard of uncle ray let alone tried them but the price was reasonable and it helped me qualify for free super saver shipping i am happy to say i was very pleasantly surprised with these chips somehow or another even though they just seem to be in a normal box when i opened that first bag i had a nice mix of big chips and little chips the salt and vinegar blend well so much so that the flavors sometimes sneak up on you it sometimes seems that with the first crunch you taste salt and the second crunch gives the vinegar in any case they are terrific i was a little reluctant about buying a somewhat large quantity of an unknown product but i am very glad i took the chance ,tasty chips , good chips but not as good as you are
it is difficult to purchase no salt potato chips at most retail stores so i ordered a case of ounce bags of uncle rays they are great not oily and they taste great you get the potato flavor instead of just salt i will be buying these from now on ,great chips great flavor , great chips
we can rarely find these potato chips where we live so i decided to find them online to satisfy our cravings we cannot be happier with the ordering from amazon the chips arrived fast and in a box that protected them from excellent and will be ordering again ,bbq chips are the best , great chips
these had heat and had good enough coating of the seasoning the first cases were amazing best i had ever then they and tried cases and they taste either like plain chips or slight hint of seasoning on them what a shame they seemed to cut back on quality to save money bad uncle ray ,they were so good more people bought them and now meh , great chips
the uncle ray bbq potato chips are comparable to lays or most commonly available chips in local markets the bbq spice a bit too much the one pound bags of about half broken chips i will not think about buying these again even with the discounted price and will pay a bit more for a much better kettle fried potato chip ,good chips nothing special , great chips
for the worse is to be true for us this shipment of chips are awful bags are extremely so was expecting to be stale however was not so cannot not explain the semi flat bags chips seem to be the bottom of the flakes you know when you try to salt your food and the top comes off the seasoning on these chips is like that it appears that the top came off a full bottle or these are the bottom of the crumbled chips where the seasoning has covered the chips too too much we just opened three bags just now because the first bags was awful opened second bag awful opened rd bag also was awful left with more probably not edible bags the chips really appear to be the not so fresh burned bottom of the get rid of leftovers very very disappointed will not buy again ,please t waste your money , not bad but not great
of the health benefits he is gotten especially from the ocean fish and tuna that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding also with this food he does not drink much water but still goes alot so i feel good that he is getting plenty of fluids in his diet my only complaint with this brand and why i only give it stars is that it has little pieces of potato and whole peas in it which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful which i do not like given the price not that big of a deal but it is a minor that i have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily in case you are wondering it is approximately to whole pea pea size potato bits per to can ,good brand of food , cat food
who does not like vegetables that are portable and at a great price cannot beat the convenience at about cents per package ,reviews for my favorite , great product
i love the metallic and sheen colors in a photo the items with the silver and gold look real the sheen really the color up a notch ,love these , great taste
ordered these for my daughters wedding cake overnight so that i would get them the next day br they came four days after wedding br but they are nice ,lovely , great taste
some crushed powder br br this being a white tea delicate and subtle and the required to use but they may not apply in this case i found the added flowers to be a little too strong to overpowering for my taste the lychee and aromas can be an acquired taste think of sweet green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma if it is not love at the first sip give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors or not br br ingredients br br organic fair trade certified white tea br natural lychee flavor br organic flavor br contains caffeine br br the somewhat off balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer time will tell but at this time stars meaning it okay seem to be the fair rating ,quality white tea with added flavors , not bad but not bad
as soon as i opened the teabag envelope the smell was truly divine nasal candy as good as the bag and the lingering scent on the envelope smelled the tea proved to be rather bitter i may have steeped it too long so will see if the bitterness steeping less however as i prefer milk or cream products in flower teas the bitterness was soon with a little soy creamer and an enjoyable cup was had lychee is truly a wonderful flavor for tea i suspect the flowers added to this lychee tea may contribute to the bitterness in the straight tea will definitely reorder ,smells like heaven , not as good as i have
if you are looking at choice tea you are probably already aware that this extraordinary company was a pioneer in the use of organic fair trade ingredients for tea br br but choice is also innovative both in design and in creative ingredient combinations as for design lychee white is part of choice new line by an innovative biodegradable pyramid shaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves as for creative ingredient combinations this healthy white tea is enhanced by the of natural lychee flavor and sublime organic blossoms the flavor and scent is one to savor and celebrate ,and taste , not as good as i be
sent very tea is delicious will continue to use this company with great enthusiasm ,one of the best , great tea
i loved this tea it is refreshing and delicious with or without sweetener a great buy i would definitely recommend this product ,delicious , great tea
boxes under each for all cherry great buy i could not find all cherry in the store and do not really care for the other flavors ,all cherry i could not find it in stores , great product
almost blow pops for less the cents each these are great for my children and a trip down memory ,who could say no to a pop , great product
be careful i ordered a pack of my says pack of but i received only stick ,pack of , not as good as
even though the item says pack of i only received one i called them up to see where the other were and they said that amazon put it seriously they are a refund but still i wanted which is what the item says and instead and only getting the should we just not trust what is on amazon now ,not pieces , not as good as it is
this salsa is definitely one for the books a perfect blend of the pepper and seasonings that made this the perfect dip for half time grown men crying because it is soooo hot is a small price to pay for this in a jar perfect for my cream cheese dip too a across the board ,salsa review , great product
this salsa was delicious it was very spicy as i am sure you have guessed but was also pretty tasty it was a bit sweeter than i prefer my salsa and given the price i do not think it is something i would eat with any frequency but definately worth the novelty and if sweet and spicy salsas are your thing you just might end up loving it ,spicy , great taste
nice combination of ingredients so that it is very hot yet still has great flavor it has a little added sugar which adds a nice bit of sweetness to the mix for the hotter salsas you really cannot go wrong with this this is one of my top four favorites which include mrs hot salsa screaming and pain is good ,one of the best , great taste
i am very to spicy foods and this has a very rich flavor half the bottle was devoted to given people my not so hot salsa reactions amazing worth the money as for me eating it the title says it all ,the mouth is strong the is , great stuff
lives brand and flavor are something they all like the price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free br br i also buy the iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as down with water in another bowl is something they really love again no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now br br if you do try this or switch your cat s over be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust in the end i think you will be very pleased with the quality and price br br also we used to take in foster cats and fed them this lives brand and they all did very well ,my cats love it , cat cats
my cats favorite cat food he is very and will not eat a lot of different cat foods but he loves this one ,cat food , cat cat cat food
i used to buy this at target but it is cheaper at amazon br br my cat goes crazy when i get out the bag so i know she loves it cheap to boot also br br i do not really stress out about which exact ingredients are in cat or dog food i figure it is all pretty decent so why not save a little money ,cat it , cat cat food
there are kittens that started hanging outside the house and i started feeding them rather than buying the smaller bags this is a great value for multiple cats the kittens love the food and always look forward to eating it shipped right to your door cannot go wrong with that ,great value , great product
i purchase pound bags of lives daily essentials a month for my daughter cats they love it she says they often around the carton and wait for her to open it they know what is in there and cannot wait for it to be opened if the cats love it we love it is not that how it goes ,daily pound bag cat food good food good price , my cat loves it
my cats love this food for the money it is a great product i get it every month the cats love the flavor ,great deal , cat cat cat food
as the ingredients contained in this food are not the optimal food sources essential to a cat well being i do not actually feed my cats this dry food br br corn is the first ingredient which is a food my cats really do not crave there is a meat source as the second ingredient but unfortunately it is a by product although there are a couple of other meat sources listed in the ingredients the addition of artificial preservatives and coloring make this cat food a less than food staple for any cat br br however the amazon price is good and with amazon prime day free shipping directly to work this is a very convenient food for the shop cats i feed while the ingredients are not the best feeding it along with canned food it is a balanced diet and seems to keep the shop cats healthy ,low quality ingredients but , cat cat cat food
i have cats that i and released they still hang around our so of course we feed them they really like lives and i believe it is good for them being old and my husband it is so easy for us to have it delivered right to our door step instead of with the bags at the store and when we get home i am very satisfied with the product and amazon the subscribe and save option is even better as i do not have to remember to order it ,cats love it , cat cat food
my two cats love this cat food more than the kirkland signature brand it is also very cheap and affordable cat food at walmart i would recommend this cat food over meow mix or friskies any day get lives dry cat food it is one of the better brands out there ,cats love this food , cat cat cat food
one of my kitties is a complete snob when it comes to food and she loves this great product to buy ,hard to please kitty loves it , great product
my cat will not eat this food i do not know why but it was a waste of money i was looking for something cheap so i guess you get what you pay for ,my cat it , cat grass
i love these pop these are rather small pops about the size of a tootsie pop they come in many flavors i think this bag is great in the long run just think halloween ,i love candy , great
pops are the best they come i lots of kinds and tast really good ,the best , great taste
this stuff is great if you are looking for a non alcoholic vanilla extract yes this is really a vanilla extract not just a flavor like the essence stuff i read somewhere on the net that the only reason they cannot call it an extract is because it was not extracted by alcohol so they have to call it a flavor br the smell and color are gorgeous plus its fair trade certified the texture is a little bit like honey i think it is the glycerin br br going to buy again for sure ,non , not as good as it is
not paying attention i thought this product was simply vanilla extract when i purchased it tried it in my coffee and got a shock yummy i had to go the bottle and realized my yummy mistake i wonder what glycerin is what it is made of is it a fat br at any rate it is delicious ,yummy , not as good as it is
i like the fact that this vanilla flavor has no alcohol in it so i could add it to my baby pancakes it does not taste the same to me as the regular stuff it is rather bland in my opinion ,bland , great product
i prefer the taste of this over the alcohol based vanilla extracts particularly in items and beverages it has a fairly thick syrupy consistency ,tastes great , not as good as
raw organic fair trade tastes great what is not to love my hope is that as more people buy their amazing chocolates that the price will come down a bit ,raw organic tastes great , great taste
i just received these today and was very disappointed to find that both of the were broken and as a serving cooking plate they were busted in half they were packaged in one sleeve of small bubble wrap in a shallow box with no other protection or packaging in the box i went online to try and return them and they are not for return this is the first return i have ever tried to do in over years of purchasing items off of amazon to the of several orders a month and yet the one time that i want to return a defective product i cannot do it i will be much more careful about what is for returns and what is not in the future ,arrived broken and is not for , not as good as i be
excellent in cereal or on top icecream i use them in my ramen noodle hot sour soup as well very very good almost a lite peanut flavor not too much salt very lightly seasoned a must try for anyone wanting a low calorie addition of into diet even the dog loves them thinks they are some special treat ,like light flavored peanut , great taste

very disappointed with purchase the dates were so dried up where it tasted like instead of dates must have been sitting there for a long long time ,up , good
i ordered three of the trays being a date nut and found that two were old or stale i admit to not checking the out of date on the exterior package but still dried out fruit the last tray was fresher but the experience was at that point i am disappointed ,dry , not as good as it is

bought this for my mom for her birthday she was dying to open it so we could all try it it was nice and fresh and everything tasted great wish i had bought one for myself ,nice and fresh , great product
these dates were absolutely delicious i was a little bit worried because the one product review that it had was only one star but as i looked at all the other date reviews the trend seemed to be bad reviews in the fall i had these delivered mid january and must say they were quite exquisite many thanks for a great treat at a large dinner party ,absolutely delicious , great product
this tea is a new flavor of black tea by tazo it is better than some other brands but not even close to being as good as their old flavor of black tea with citrus which they took off the market i do not think this tea is worth sending away for because you can buy it locally in most grocery stores ,just ok , not as good as it is
expensive but worth it and ive tried every iced tea out there lipton is pretty good too but this is the best and many other iced teas like bigelow are terrible but this is great like the coffee shop ,best iced tea , great tea
i have nine cats and they are crazy about these kibbles the last thing you want is lbs of cat food the cats hate but i will be buying them more of this ,cats love it , cat cat cat food
this vendor is she ripped off her from other and claims them as her own she has no conscience and i would highly recommend that you do your purchasing elsewhere ,off all of their from other , great product
i have used your product for years and find myself in a town where they are sold only in very small bottles i am used to buying your product by the half gallon and would like to make my purchases online i have tried using other products which pale in comparison to your original barbecue sauce ,the best , great product
if you like soft licorice these cats are not for you br br a perfect anise y balance of salty and sweet these little licorice kitties are perfect you pop one or several in your mouth and let them melt a bit before you on your flavorful chewy journey br hard exterior lasts forever if you suck on them licorice br br very fresh super fast shopping too thank you guys ,perfect for hard licorice lovers , the best
at a sitting for my fix okay sometimes if it is a superb book d br the last time i ordered it they were generous and added a pound of their premium chocolate as a thank you for being a customer that to find their particular product because i do not live near one of their stores and unless i visit say st louis where it is i have to mail order anyway i prefer my licorice hard and let it in my mouth so when i get an order for lbs i leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off that makes it last longer in my mouth and does not affect flavor but that it personal mouth feel preference it without problems so i will just have to go back to that and pay for my pleasure and stock up licorice gotta have it ,not as good as french long , the best soda ever
very firm small pieces with an intense licorice flavor i love black licorice and have been trying different gluten free options i will be ordering more of this one ,licorice flavor , delicious
i do not know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough ,kind of stale , not as good as
this was a disappointment i use other products from this line manufacturer on a regular basis i bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid stevia in my purse the first time i went to use it the liquid was a dark color almost black and i had to throw out the latte i was trying to sweeten all the manufacturer other liquid products are clear and in fact this is clear liquid it must have been outdated spoiled i had already thrown the packing out so do not know how it was i tried calling the amazon supplier but the call rolled into voice mail it is not enough money to spend time following up but it was disappointing ,must have been , not as good as it is
cans are lined w material that contains bpa which means the effort to grow the tomatoes was a waste of time br br i did not see the liner when i opened a different can from the same case i am scratching my head ,a , not as good as it is
the ingredients are simple and pure and one of the few brands that does not add unnecessary additives generally i like to make my own sauce from scratch but this is my second choice if i am short on time its taste good and not artificially sweet i love the products including the tomato paste ,best thing to fresh , great product
these are the best canned tomatoes i have tasted they have a fresh flavor similar to home canned this is my second time buying a set they are a little more acidic bright and have a flavor than other tomatoes comes with a basil leaf in each can note the oz tins are a better value than the oz ones ,excellent , best popcorn ever
these diced its just mush but i like the no bpa and would buy again for that reason but dont expect diced ,ok , good
i have been eating these since about years old and are my favorite chips in the world just dont eat too many of them ,too addicting , great chips
themed shower the arrived packaged well but i noticed the box said they are from oriental trading company if i wanted a cheap product that i knew was low quality and from china then i would have bought them directly from their site at for of them however from the picture these looked well made the picture is very and so is the description they show same colored lollipops mine came in a variety of colors they also gave that the lollipops were x i noticed they looked a bit small and when i measured they did not even come to long not any of them even though they are all this was very disappointing since i planned to stand them up in a of lemon drops overall i am very disappointed in this product and the seller for not being honest about the product they are providing to consumers ,false , great product
i purchased these to give to children who come to my place of business when they arrived it says clearly on the back of the individual wrapper made in china no way i am giving these to children if they were manufactured in china following the whole pet food the fact that these are made in china needs to be much more clearly ,made in china , not as good as it is
i ordered lollipops to use as party favors only to be disappointed that the front and back of the candy had writing on it so i them using clear bags purchased from also a few were cracked or broken so luckily i ordered more than enough they are so adorable ,mini , not as good as it is
i used these and a bunch of other colored lollipops for a friend birthday and she got a kick out of it she had been complaining about feeling old so we threw a kid themed party she had a great time i do not think it is possible to eat one of these lollipops without feeling like a kid ,very cute , good but not great
i used these lollipops for a candy princess costume for my daughter they came in perfect condition and exactly like the picture shows they do come in a group of such a great value i was extremely satisfied ,perfect , great taste
i purchased these for my candy buffet at my wedding and i am not impressed at all i could have saved money by ordering them directly from oriental trading company which is clearly where they came from they look cheap and they are not as colorful as shown in the picture the oriental trading company information is on the back of the wrappers on the lollipops most of the lollipop sticks are bent and two lollipops arrived broken the box only has lollipops but in the description it says there is i would have expected that if i knew they were coming from oriental trading company but that is not in the description so i feel ripped off ,not what i expected , not as good as it is
i had purchased these to go along with a costume for halloween they shipped quickly and were packaged securely with bubble wrap none of the lollipops were broken in transit br br it turns out the costume i ordered from another seller did not fit at all and was made of very cheap material so i could not even alter it to fit since i had to return the costume i requested to return these as well i was immediately fully refunded without even being asked to ship the lollipops back so the five stars are so the amazing service br br now i think we will hand out the lollipops with the rest of our halloween candy which i think the kids in our neighborhood will love ,great service , great product
i bought these lollipops for my daughter rd birthday they are super cute and the kids loved them definitely met my expectations ,loved these , great taste
these lollipops are not as pictured they came in assorted colors some really not the rainbow shown in the picture they are also completely flat rather than being the rolled old fashioned candy style so they look cheap i need them for a birthday party and i was really disappointed when i received them ,not as , not as good as it is
five stars however at first lick the lollipop has a slightly off taste but this goes away after a minute and is not or disgusting in any way i quite a bit at the reviews of individuals because the lollipops are made in china i am not dead dying sick good enough as well the text on the wrapper is fine i was not by it and i am not afraid to share i would only them if they were for presentation rather than eating br the colors are not as as in the picture and the are not glazed so they do not have that shiny look that many others have none of mine came broken and they were well wrapped i am happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all minus the few that i share with friends but i would try something different next time ,slightly taste to with but i cannot eating them , not as good as i like
i used this for my daughters candy land birthday party and the kids loved them they are not full size but they are still sooooo cute ,great for party , great
bought these for a birthday and they were perfect all arrived and wrapped really well super cute and perfect for year olds ,fun stuff , great taste
i ordered the lollipops for party favors at my son st birthday party the lollipops are inches and i used inch thank you stickers on them so cute the description states that lollipops are included in the order i ordered boxes and only received lollipops in each box i contacted the seller customer service i received a response and right away they promptly corrected the order i was pleasantly surprised to receive another full box of and not just the i expected the lollipops are wrapped in bubble wrap out of three boxes only one lollipop was cracked not a big deal to me since i did receive an extra box great lollipop at a great price ,very cute pops , not as good as it is
i opened this product to find that the lollipops were all broke i was very disappointed they did not package this product in a way that would help keep it from breaking you are better off buying them from a store around your area ,shipping , not as good as it is
that this is considered a toy i bought these as a decoration for a themed baby shower and they arrived in perfect condition i used them in surrounded by colored crinkle cut paper and used as on the buffet table lots of compliments i have kept them and plan to use again for future parties these will not be consumed so no idea how they taste ,small , great product
got these as part of a party favor for a rainbow birthday party so i have not actually tasted them the lollipops are cute the wrappers have writing on them which i wish they did not would have been much without the writing they are a bit smaller than i expected just slightly larger than a regular lollipop and a few arrived broken but really they were well packaged and looked cute for the party ,cute small a arrived broken , not as good as it is
these arrived securely packaged not even a chip on one lollipop they also tasted really good and looked very pretty at my sister baby shower i would buy these again for myself and suggest to future buyers ,great product , great product
anyone who has been on a low carb eating program for any period of time will tell you that it gets boring we are new to the dixie carb line but i was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent taste some of the other low carb lines like have a terrible aftertaste or require the user to have a great imagination yes this is really supposed to be a chocolate bar but the dixie carb items are great easy to make nice portion size great taste and no imagination required it really is a muffin and no sugar alcohol my only issue is that they are a little pricey otherwise perfect ,muffins , not as good as i be
i am going to guess that yuck did not mix it up right because frankly these taste surprisingly good considering they are supposed to be lo carb they are easy to make and the non diabetic in the house thinks they are just as tasty as i do i do agree that the price is pretty outrageous though ,excellent product , not as good as it is
this muffin mix is awful all you taste is flour and sour cream which is used to make these it just tastes i have tried and tried br there are no good tasting low carb treats esp for diabetics ,yuck , great product
i spent the first five years of my life in brazil and my american parents both spoke and introduced me to brazilian food and culture this is one of my favorite foods ever and the lingering memory i have of brazil fluffy moist and made out of tapioca flour these little rolls are nothing like american cheese bread seriously they aren t its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven and they are just as fabulous cold br br is the best maker of the dry mix and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy delicious treat or side dish they never turn out wrong ,favorite thing about , great product
i made these recently for a holiday party i have never seen anything go so fast br br they were very easy to make just add a few ingredients mix and throw them in the oven i will definitely be buying and making these again ,delicious and easy , great product
these are not as good at houston grill but they tasted great the texture is different but in lieu of having these on a daily basis i have found something that i can make i would surely recommend these to ,love , good
since being gluten free i have tried all types of gf breads and they are all very expensive who knew that the had the bread game on lock with this inexpensive tapioca version of cheese bread it is custom which is probably why they are all so skinny lol but i loved it and will be ordering a whole lot more ,i was to eat bread again , great product
my item got to my house on time and i was surprised on how well my package was packed i recommend this store to anyone ,service was good , great product
these are tiny packets i bought them thinking they were the regular size and are not my kids love the product but this particular package was expensive for tiny packages i sent them back ,mini mini is right , great product
in this case they are not unhealthy fillers and these are very delicious our kids just love them we serve one ball as a serving as that is the perfect healthy carb portion for a meal piece has the following nutrition just in case you are wondering br br calories br br fat br br trans fat br br sodium br br carbohydrate br br protein br br for our dinners we try to keep our carb side to under fat carb this fits perfectly the taste is superb baked in the oven they come out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside all with no grease we now keep these on hand instead of french fries i know they cost more but they taste better and they are so much healthier we wait for one of the sales and buy several boxes at a time ,yummy , great taste
perfect year round with just about any meat dish these omaha steaks twice baked potatoes are a gourmet delight the consistency of the whipped potatoes is smooth and the little bits of bacon peppers and cheese add to the of flavor they cook easily in either the conventional oven or on the grill when wrapped in foil go ahead treat yourself ,the best twice baked you will ever have , great taste
several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks i am a person who loves to grill and do so about nights a week so i know a little about meat and how to cook it first this is not high end dry aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher the steaks are about a pound after shipping and the high prices the hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry i am so disappointed in the quantity and quality i really have no words to describe how disappointed i am with this whole deal to top everything off i received a e mail coupon for off my next order so the coupon that i purchased was more than on line deals wow do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store ,over way over priced , great product
these are actually very tasty pure potatoes with a great texture and no nasty filler stuff no bacon no cheese just tasty potatoes they cook well in either the oven or microwave i add a touch of either salt pepper or seasoning to spice it up i rated out of stars because they could be a bit bigger portion however this item is a fairly good value for the money ,i like these , not as good as it is
these are actually pretty good little potato puffs and best of all no cheese unless you like that sort of thing which we do not so it is nice to actually find a potato side dish with no cheese in it br br anyways these are surprisingly good and they toast up nicely in the oven in like minutes worth it for ,actually pretty good , not as good as it is
they are more potato in the shape of a ball rather than au but nevertheless yum yum yum ,yum yum yum , great product
not happy with the product once they were cooked the potatoes were flat and did not look any thing like the product picture that was seen the shipping cost as much as the potatoes did ,not like the picture , good
i love to order these type of cooked potatoes and they are so great with a steak ,now this is my kind of potato with , great taste
i really like this product it tasted great and only took a few minutes to make in the microwave ,tasty and easy to make , great product
very good side dish easy to make easy to eat as others have said needs a little spice but other than that they are delicious ,very good , good
i was surprised at the size of these potatoes i have bought them at my local grocery store before and was disappointed that they were so small these are perfect tasty cook just right love em ,tasty and perfect , good but not great
these potatoes are good but i do not know if i would get them again the garlic taste to me was off and strong and i love garlic hoping i just got an off batch ,yum , good
excellent and tasty though i thought not enough garlic so i added more when i order garlic i guess i expect more of it but perfect if you have guests as it will never anyone omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers a company hard to find anymore ,tasty , great taste
we had these along with omaha prime both were great two where plenty to fill up made them in toaster oven in less then minutes ,quick easy taste great , great product
no of trans fats which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes also no high fructose corn syrup which is another on a food product like this and is always a plus if you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example chances are the butter used sour cream etc will be full of chemicals trans fats high fructose corn syrup these not so much so there is a definite degree of quality with stuffed baked potatoes each potato does have grams of saturated fat which is the but that is obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon cheese and sour cream i was also expecting there to be no fiber but it turns out there is grams of fiber per baked potato half another plus overall the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy being made with quality ingredients ,a , not as good as i be
these potatoes are really very good my husband and i both love them and way too easy we will be buying more of these ,so good , great taste
i got these in the mail today i know right sounds so weird to say i got in the mail haha come in dry ice cooler and were in box all in their own lil plastic bags just stick them on a baking sheet for min at degrees when you get them out of the oven you smell the cheese and it has nice crunchy outside with creamy potato inside if you want the best side dish to your steak or other meat hey could even use for breakfast with some eggs and sausage your choice this get a for taste for presentation buy these now great price too thanks for your time and thank you omaha steaks the best at great prices ,these are the best , not as good as i be
so so good delicious easy to prepare food i would definitely order again had a gourmet taste and took only minutes to get ready yum ,so good , great taste
i like em but nothing unique about the flavor basically saves you from having to make them at home a little pricey but for a treat what the heck ,tasted ok a bit overpriced , great taste
they taste pretty good i eat one of these with some of the poultry selections from omaha steaks it makes a great meal ,they are pretty good , good but not great
these potatoes are pretty good they can be eaten alone or served with a meal really like potatoes and this is an easy choice ,easy for a single , good
very good transaction and omaha food was sent properly i already left one feedback ,chicken and baked , great product
these potatoes are very good along with all their steaks and hamburgers i would definately recommend omaha steaks to anyone looking for a gourmet dinner at a reasonable price ,baked , great taste
i am a big fan of energy bites and the peanut ones are probably my favorite they are reasonably priced and a great snack think of peanut m m and a coffee all at once since they taste so good it is very tempting to eat the whole box they claim it is a lot of caffeine but it does not feel like more than a big coffee or a large energy drink so i usually give in to the temptation br br i highly recommend these ,big fan , good but not great
a diamond would be cheaper to ship than a car i do not buy from any supplier that ships by price br this item is then you pay for up to for shipping no way i would pay that for one jar ,shipping by price not weight , great product
where is the ingredient list for this product thought all foods were supposed to have it would never buy any food without first knowing what is in it ,what no ingredient , not as good as it is
sell a variety of plants and ice cream that was about a year ago and unfortunately the place is now out of business i was getting low on it and was glad to find it here on amazon as i could not find anything even close at any grocery store in a mile store were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice i told them if they carried it they would sell a lot br br i have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor cannot be beat it is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine i prefer the roasted over the cold pressed but both are great in their own way it is nice to be able to pour or spray br br bottom line if you are a garlic lover buy this ,great product this is real garlic juice , great product
it is a great product especially if you like garlic no need for slicing which is a good thing when your right side is just garlic too not an oily salty product just plain or roasted garlic and it lasts a long time too ,garlic , not as good as it is
i love my garlic spray so much that i ordered more i grow garlic but i do not even bother them anymore not with this product there are cloves in every bottle thats a lot of yummy garlic ,garlic juice , great product
i love the taste of real garlic not the granulated or stuff these are great flavoring agents especially for popcorn as a liquid in and rubs love the choice between roasted and raw and a little goes a long way i first bought this product years ago despite using one or the other at least once a week i am only now needing to replace them br yum ,now a , great product
i had heard about their prickly pear tea in a and decided to try it since i had not had any since i was in arizona it was better than i remembered i tried it first hot and then used the remainder for ice tea and both were really good the company delivered super fast too which was great i recommend this tea highly particularly if you like prickly pear teas ,delicious tea , great tea
loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form this tea is black tea with prickly pear flavor the shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea if there is a prickly pear component it is all but when i drink it it just tastes like regular black tea very disappointing ,cannot the , not as good as it is
butternut mountain maple syrup is the real deal the grade b is wonderful on pancakes or in coffee just about on anything you would like sweetened br delivery was timely and the product came as expected i recommend this ,syrup , great coffee
i just received my shipment and could hardly wait to try this product we love which is what we call them instead of stickers because they can be removed so easily my daughter designed signs to be printed in reverse to use on her car windows they printed beautifully we have the print shop program i am going to have a lot of fun with this product because there are windows everywhere and other like tv and computer ,wow make your own , great product
this was a really good idea and the final product is outstanding i use the on my car window and everybody asks where i bought the i made two thumbs up ,great product , great product

frosting the first time i used this frosting i was disappointed but a year has gone by and i thought that maybe i had gotten a bad container i really should have thought twice about buying it again but i wanted to give pillsbury the benefit of the doubt boy was i wrong in doing that both times that i used it the frosting pretty much off of the cake my cakes were definitely cooled i had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers after it in the fridge i began to ice it sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake again this product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting the recipe needs or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together shame on me for trying it a second time ,horrible , not bad but not as good as it is
excellent product crab cakes made with lump style has been a family tradition during christmas holidays for over years local grocery stores do not carry lump style and only offer fancy minced crab meat which is ok but not as as lump style ,delight , great product
i bought this because of the good feedback and bad luck that i have had with canned crab i was hoping that this product was different than previous canned crab that i have had alas it is just a little better unfortunately canned crab just seems to be not very good and i have to stick with fresh expensive crab ,just ok i that all canned is not that great , not as good as it is

this is a wonderful and very handy product i am thrilled by all the yummy ways this can be used my aunt who lived in for years said they used it all the time and loved it ,wonderful product , great product
br i do have one caveat about the product but it is about the recipe given not the spice mix i think the amount of it is suggested you use grams is too much and you can easily use grams instead also i think it is easier to mix the spices and first and cover the chicken or vegetables with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while frying br br to make vegan you can substitute vegetables for chicken coconut milk for yogurt and safflower or peanut oil for br br overall this spice mix makes the tastiest i have had outside of a restaurant and even some of them and the price makes this an incredible deal there are bags per package and there are packages so this makes large batches for with free shipping i will definitely order more when i run out ,makes excellent , great product
i love this tea it has a mild flavor and no caffeine the only problem is that the string comes from the bag after about a minute in hot water this does not happen once in a while it happens nearly every time br br triple leaf tea please fix this bag issue it is frustrating to the point where i may look for a similar tea from another company ,good tea bad bag , not as good as it is
this tea is so helpful for congestion and it tastes great too make sure you let it steep as long as the directions say it really seems to help you to feel better ,great tasting tea for cold , great tea

i have been feeding liver biscotti for years i was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my dog additives can be a trigger and liver biscotti filled the bill the ingredients are top quality the bite size bits are perfect for training and do not up your the bite size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds which is a problem with other treats and for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities there is an anti recipe recommended ,healthy non just the right size and delicious , great product
this is an excellent training treat for every day it is not a high value treat used for more challenging training situations nor is it so bland that it does not serve as an incentive it is a good size though it does make some crumbs plus liver biscotti is fun to say ,good training treat , great product
my dogs love this treat when my oldest male was younger he would sit down stand up go down roll over etc and do every trick in his before i even gave him a whenever i pulled out a bag of the liver biscotti my female also loves this but she is a little less silly also this has never upset their stomachs nor caused allergic reactions i finally had to find a place that sold this in bulk i e lbs bags since i was going to the store all the time to buy more of these i also stuff their with a combo of these and their regular kibble and some pumpkin and freeze it i highly recommend this treat ,my dogs love this treat , my dog loves these
our dog loves these treats we sprinkle a few into his regular dry dog food and he gobbles everything up as fast as he can we also use them as rewards for good wonderful nutritious really good to have on hand at all times ,the best dog treat ever , my dog loves these

as another reviewer mentioned these treats are crunchy i like them for reasons my dog cannot just them down she has to chew them so they last and i like that the may be good for her teeth the treats are small but again are crunchy i m glad i found these she loves them and i like giving them to her ,great treats , great for
i have two dogs that absolutely love these treats the lb bag size that i purchased is very convenient and long lasting the vendor that i purchased them from is very several emails were sent me on the of my order and it is upcoming delivery the price was extremely reasonable the best part is the fact that my pups adore these treats and they are good for them to nibble on throughout the day a guilt free doggie reward ,excellent dog treats , great treat
our water dog has been trained on these bite sized little treats he loves them and will do anything for them good dog ,treats , my dog loves them
i do not mind paying a lot for a quality treat for my dogs as these are but i have a real problem in companies who price on shipping charges its obviously not enough for them to get the amount of money which is high for the treats themselves they have to also make money off me for shipping charges there is no way that it cost them to ship a lb bag of treats to me dollars would be fair and accurate this is the reason i gave it only stars instead of ,a great treat but way overpriced shipping , my dog loves them
our four dogs love this stuff this bite size treat is a perfect size for training the dogs like the crunch it is shaped like a small square there is enough in this huge bag to make little gift bags for friends with dogs ,our dogs go crazy for this , great for
the ultimate treat for dogs of all sizes our dogs are absolutely crazy for liver biscotti we love the size of this treat it makes it very easy to use them as daily treats and not worry that you are over feeding the size is also great for using as bait for showing br br we love the fact that all natural ingredients with no preservatives are used all you have to do is open the bag and smell what is inside it smells so good you might be tempted to try one too br br we love the pound bag having multiple dogs this bag really is a cost saver you will see significant savings over buying the small oz bags br br it also makes a great gift for your dog loving friends spread the joy of liver biscotti ,in our house , my dog loves these
a fantastic product for pet treats great smell and has freeze dried liver treats beat by and owner of fussy ,rich j , my dog loves them
this was very pricey for what is essentially a small bag of hard crumbs br maybe my dog is just spoiled but she treats these like third class treats it is definitely on the bottom of the doggie treat more often than not she will simply walk away from these glad other people like them but i will not be buying them again ,waste of money , my dog loves these
i was just around on amazon when i ran into this add for beer nuts when i noticed someone had left a review it was pretty funny being the beer lover that i am i had to try them well they are here now and i cant drink beer without them they have a story on the back about how the guy got started in the and soon his beer nuts were in bars around america see why they are pretty darn good ,u me into it beer nut , best ever
i used to eat beer nuts all the time as a kid sorta like honey roasted peanuts but more unique flavor if you never tried em if you like honey roasted peanuts you will love these ,beer nuts , great taste
great product wish they were still available in bars and stores have given cans to several of my golf buddies and they agree with me i am just glad they are still available on line ,likes beer nuts , great product
some reviewers must have a short memory i have been eating beer nuts since childhood and the ones i ordered tasted like they always have sweet and salty bought them locally until i could not find them anymore great product and price for oz cans ,just as i , not as good as it is
after a second purchase of a oz beer nuts peanuts pack i can level no complaints the shipment again arrived without any adverse settling such as clumping inside the cans although the flavor may be a bit than my childhood memory of them this may be instead to the taste buds of a middle nonetheless everyone i know who has tried this product likes it either as a stand alone snack or as an to a couple of beers beer nuts is a tasty if winner ,mild sweet and salty blend , not as good as i be
this is the second time ordering beer nuts i can not find them anywhere in local stores the shipment came cans per order and cans were damaged called amazon customer service and the next day another cans appeared at my door br br the nuts are always great unless can is damaged and nuts are stale but the customer service was the shining star thank you will order again ,great customer service , great product
my husband is a beer nut lover looked in many stores br and could only find small bags love these large cans ,hard to find beer nuts , great product
i am years old and i have eaten these nuts for many years the ones mailed to me are very tastey the only problem is that they were around and a lot of the red skins came off and went to the bottom of the can no big deal but it would have been better if they had stayed on the nuts i will order from amazon again ,beer nuts , great product
not always available at our local stores i love them they are especially good watching football with you favorite malt beverage this is a good deal and super fast delivery too the nuts were fresh and tasty as always ,the best , great
these are the long time classic not as sweet as honey roasted peanuts these have just the right balance to go with a nice cold brew amazon price on these is really great ,salty with a hint of , great taste
i remember well the beer nuts i used to savor those were the days of the big type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness with a salty tang i remember so well these nuts i now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of beer nuts in any way yes there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real plus these nuts are simply the common inexpensive spanish peanuts in short i would just ask beer nuts what happened ,what happened , not as good as it is
i ate beer nuts all through my childhood years and into my after that you could not buy them in upstate ny when a great friend of mine said he was looking for them i checked out the net to find them on your site br they are horrible what a they taste more like spanish peanuts with out the salt the beer nuts i remember where sweet and salty just like the label says these peanuts are bland bland bland ,beer nuts , not as good as
the flavor of the old beer nuts is almost entirely gone the beer nuts are now just plain spanish peanuts with a slight flavor hardly noticeable extremely disappointing ,the flavor is gone , not as good as
it is not the best way to buy beer nuts br br perhaps the product had been exposed to high heat and a whole lot of shaking most of the coating and flavoring was off of the nuts even though the individual cans are sealed it is like the nuts had been sitting out in a bowl for a long time on a hot day ,not my best experience , not as good as it is

yes it is expensive but it is worth it i have yet to find a marinade that stands up to this one add some crushed garlic sauteed onions and vegetables of your choice then mix it all with this sauce and whatever meat you choose i prefer using the resulting marinade by adding some fresh rosemary and lamb for two days you will not believe the and you get at the table worth every penny ,expensive but worth it , great product
it is not a traditional bbq sauce in terms of flavor but you could easily use it for that it is very thick and has a strong not too hot but hotter than most spicy bbq sauce and it is made from much better ingredients than most bbq or sweet hot sauces it tastes very fruity rather than sugary sweet it would be great on almost anything grilled or stir fried and it is incredible in pork and beans do not let the price scare you away from this outstanding condiment ,one of the best sweet hot out there , not as good as it is

i have tried a couple of different powders but this one is a step above the other ones the richness of the bean has a dark smooth flavor within the powder it is just a better product ,awesome , good
i use a lot of raw cocoa for my power protein drinks with the high price of cocoa on the market this is an excellent price especially for an organic product the cocoa is less tasty than my regular brand but does very well for the price my main complaint is that the product came in a sealed plastic bag with no label i would like to see an organic label as well as the nutrition info for the product ,the price is right , great taste
love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with vitamins a d and the x factor read weston a price and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot plus cacao the and sorry i am bit but you know it makes you feel good and happy br also process it with evo coconut oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil i often toss in soaked dried nuts and dried fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars just process in batches so it is kind of like those bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw br go for it buy this huge bag share the goodness and you will be healthier and happier for it i guarantee peace be with you ,not what i ordered amazon , great product
this cocoa powder has a deep fruity taste i highly recommend it i recently bought a blender which means that i now make smoothies a day this cocoa powder plus some almond milk frozen fruit yogurt and a dash of maple syrup makes an excellent milk shake disclaimer i like of all chocolate so take this positive review with a grain of salt ,great tasting cocoa powder , great product
this was my first time ordering raw cacao powder and i was pleasantly surprised the item was packed and shipped and i love the resealable bag i initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and i did not taste anything i then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetable fruit juice which normally tastes like bananas i was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a chocolate shake this is one of the best deals you will find online on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great this is one of the healthiest foods in the world and i recommend this seller if you are looking to purchase it ,and organic raw powder , great product
it goes well with other flavors such as almond extract if you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of almond extract your icing will have no equal in chocolate cake i personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake the acid helps to and flavors i like making cake with cake flour which is about has about wheat gluten and rice flour the reason for this should be obvious the heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough br br raw cocoa powder is rich in such as and and has been shown to low density and in a variety of models human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases high density and levels although the drug companies having to understand the mechanism in which this happens ,raw , good but not as good as i be
this product described as organic raw cacao powder from is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder i have had the taste of this product is definitely not as good this product has a bitter muddy thin taste as compared to the fuller richer taste of the real thing from other vendors as soon as i tasted this product which is for the trash bag i understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors it is nowhere near as good spend a few dollars more and get the real thing ,poor quality product , not as good as it is
this powder and this company are both superb there was a small problem with the order and they it in such a manner that i will be a customer forever ,the best , great product
this is a very tasty cacao powder it arrived in an bag does not have an organic or product description but it seems to be the real deal good flavor similar to or better than name brand powders i have purchased in the past will definitely purchase again ,super delicious , delicious

wonderful product br br all the bread mixes i have tried on amazon are not disappointing br br will be back for more they will make great christmas presents ,great , great product
i figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be this is it if you are of a certain age over or you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon this cannot be found in store bacon anymore modern bacon is thin lightly poorly smoked even the so called gourmet bacon this is the old fashioned flavor and thickness of bacon the way it was in the good old days arrives nice and cool in an ice pack cheaper if you buy the pack ,what bacon is to be , not as good as it is
these are thin crisp fragrant cookies and are very delicious and tasty they are excellent with a glass of cold almond milk or hot herbal tea my choices if you like ginger snaps you will love ginger snaps ,delicious , delicious

gluten free diet you for those treats like licorice and malted milk realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be in the near future we need to alter our expectations for this treat br br i had tried this company raspberry and strawberry pretty good although not easy to chew think not real licorice you understand but pretty good as an alternative br br so i thought i try these too how bad could they be i found them pleasant to chew not tough at all but the taste nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful br br so i am stuck with packs br br see if you cannot find a source where you can buy just one pack to try out your tastes may be different than mine and you might enjoy them ,got a cold with a nasty , not as good as i be
after finding out two of our family members have celiac disease we had to give up licorice and cherry nibs candy tree organic cherry bites have no sugar and truly the cherry nibs with gluten after a year of not having the real thing my husband candy tree are actually better ,better than cherry the ones with gluten , delicious
this licorice has very good taste my daughter is on a gluten free diet and she loves these cherry bites ,candy tree organic cherry , delicious
maybe these a better when they are very fresh you could ruin dental work if not careful chewing these they taste great ,a little to hard , great taste
wow this was the first licorice i would had in two years after being diagnosed with celiac disease that was one of the hardest things to give up these are nice not exactly like the real thing but close enough there are many companies that call their product licorice but they are merely rip of dots candy i e nothing like real licorice very gooey and stick to your teeth these are quite firm more like older licorice but still a great chew it satisfied me and my craving for real licorice ,gluten free , the best
gluten free foods tend to be extremely expensive when compared to regular foods this licorice follows that trend for the times when you would like to treat yourself candy tree organic licorice is a tasty and safe treat for gluten intolerant people amazon seems to have the best prices on it too ,gluten free licorice , great for gluten free
this dressing became an instant favorite of mine it is fat free without losing the flavor alot of other lose alot of flavor in their fat free versions and that only makes you have to use twice as much wish bone is now my only choice for ranch dressing my husband does not usually go for fat free or diet anything but i put this on our salads and he didnt even know ,instant favorite , great taste
if i had not purchased this salad dressing myself i never would have guessed it was fat free served it with fresh vegetables during thanksgiving pre dinner and it was a definite hit with the guests too ,thick and creamy nice flavor , not as good as

i bought this for my husband since he loves ranch he uses ranch dressing with everything before i bought it i read a review that said it taste good of the fat free well my husband had it and says it is aweful i guess to each his own everyone tastebuds are not alike someone else may like it so i am not going to discourage anyone from trying it however i had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes ranch in the family does not like this one i guess he needs the fat ,sorry taste is not pleasing , not as good as it is
want to taste something different then you are coming to the right place i just love the smoothness and flavor of the ranch get on your horses or and order some today ,great fat free , not as good as
this is a very smooth tea from tea i was so excited when they came to and i bought a bag of this tea to make at home it has an chocolatey flavor but not overpowering it is a great tea for everyone including people just starting to drink tea i love it in a latte i just microwave some milk and use that instead of water ,delicious tea of almond and chocolate but not , great tea

these little are tough to find so i was happy to get a big pack at a good price online my daughter is content with these as a reward for doing something well and at calories a piece not all that unhealthy ,great product and good price , good but not great

i bought them for a friend because she loves the cherry ones and they are hard to find i kept half for myself i admit gone in no time ,delicious and hard to find , good for you
everyone knows what a tic tac is but let me tell you something if you like orange tic tac you are going to love wild cherry tic tacs very cherry flavored with just enough of a mix of sweet and sour do yourself a favor and try some ,yum , not as good as it is
i love these wild cherry tic tacs and they are impossible to find in stores i am so glad that i can get them from amazon and the price is excellent they are a great low calorie treat and i will keep buying them from amazon highly recommend this purchase ,great tasting little treats , delicious
i low orange and after reading reviews i decided to try these and there almost just as good orange is still my favorite but cherry is pretty close ,good , great taste
these are one of my favorite flavors of tic tacs the flavor is a true sour cherry and quite intense you really get a lot of flavor out of one calorie treat which can satisfy for quite a while ,cherry good , great taste
since husband quit smoking many many yrs ago he took up the tic tac habit with cinnamon tic tacs they no longer make cinnamon so he has tried the wild cherry and they are ok ,solution , great product
very nice product br full of quality items not the cheap candies like other baskets ,basket , good

i love sorghum flour it is mild in flavor and smell it is easily mixed into flour blends for gluten free baking too it is one of my favorites along with sweet rice coconut and almond ,another favorite , great product
i buy most of my flours from bob red mill in the pack boxes if only because having all the bags and boxes the same size makes it easier to store them it is good flour and the bag a good size for baking for a small family also a good shape that will stand up on the counter while you scoop flour out of it ,good flour for gluten free baking , not as good as it is
my sister is to wheat so i make her a lot of gluten free foods i searched local stores and could not find sorghum flour so i looked on amazon and finally found it it was all packed wonderfully and arrived perfectly fine and i am already using it ,great for gf baking , great for gluten free
i love baking with the bob red mill sweet white sorghum flour i use it in many things but i tend to lean toward sweeter treats such as cakes and muffins i make a crumble topping with this flour that my family and guests beg for i would highly recommend this flour to any baker even more for the gluten intolerant ones i use normal recipes and just replace the wheat flour it always turns out fantastic ,perfect treat , great product
i am a big fan of sorghum flour for my baked goods it gives everything a bit of especially cakes and adds an extra bit of sweet to the baking i highly recommend this for baking flour mixes you may not want to add it to savory recipes though because of the light sweet flavor ,best for , great product
spectrum naturals walnut oil refined is a very mild oil i cannot detect any walnut smell or taste any walnut flavor at all maybe that is what you want in some cases though i was hoping for a more nutty flavor like raw walnuts br br it does have the advantage of having higher omega content than most oils also most oils that are high in omega like fish oil and flax oil have a strong taste which you probably do not want on your salad br br unlike some of spectrum oils it is not organic ,oil , great product
great product br br the stevia powder will not raise your blood glucose level and it is all natural br br use very sparingly since it is much sweeter than sugar br br tastes more natural than artifical sweeteners and is healthy to use since it is an organic natural sweetener ,white stevia oz , great product
too crazy about the during taste either br br then i tried nunaturals this product is awesome and like no other stevia i have tried it is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste unless you put in way too much a common mistake by people new to this it comes in tablets and in powdered form in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings it also comes in alcohol free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor unlike aspartame which becomes even more toxic when heated stevia can be used in baking nunaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that since i am a raw i cannot tell you how it tastes but i am sure it is good judging by their other products br br thanks to these great products i can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets ,great taste safe natural , not as good as i be
it stars if the product labeling did not try to hide the fact that it is just not very potent for about to the cost of this product you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a low cost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead or just use them full strength which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia br br in case you are wondering where i got the by mass value from this is how i calculated it on a precise scale i found the density of this product to be grams per teaspoon the label says it contains mg per tsp thus tsp has mg stevia extract in mg mixed powder the concentration mass comes to mg stevia per gram of product or percent by weight pretty weak stuff but still much sweeter than cane sugar ,only stevia extract but very good flavor , not as good as i be
i used to use agave nectar and honey even though i picked organic there was still more sugar than desired after i put in my recipes i actually got due to the sugars in those products br br but this product is great i use it in my protein shakes smoothies and baking recipes muffins breads and it is awesome br br i make a chocolate milkshake and this stuff really rounds off the edges br cottage cheese br chocolate protein powder br cacao powder br almond milk br nustevia powder br br just need maybe cup of each ingredient and cup of almond milk and it takes just like a sugary chocolate milk shake ,my new favorite sweetener , great product
this is the best tasting stevia powder i have tried most other powders have a weird after taste but this one doesn t i recently bought a lb bag of it online and i am making my way through it ,best tasting stevia , best ever
cutting sugar out of our diet we went to splenda then finding that it was also unhealthy and baking with it made foods flat and dry we went to stevia no calorie powder after much research proved that stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no bad health effects the trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste i also found that using a stevia that has an ratio is the best tasting and this is the best that i have found because of using very small amounts this jar lasts for months this is also the best price anywhere is a trusted vendor as is amazon ,get healthy live better and longer , great product
is truly a guilt free sweetner br br of all the brands i have tried nunaturals is the best it dissolves easily in ice tea and it does not have any bitter taste br br i keep the packets in my car and my backpack for when i eat out i use the stevia baking blend to replace sugar in all my muffins and cookies and this is large oz jar the best size for use at home i keep a tsp measuring spoon in the jar to spoon it out br br i have given up all artificial sweetners i no longer drink diet coke and wont until they make it with stevia instead of splenda br br if you have not used stevia before i urge you to try it if you have used other brands and did not like them try nustevia and you will be impressed ,an excellent alternative to artificial , great product
this has been the best tasting stevia i have tried i also think this is a better value than some of the others i really like not having to open all the packets when i make a gallon of tea ,best tasting , best ever
if you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea you can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the stevia powder br br unlike artificial sweeteners stevia is never bitter and will not leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth the packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods br br by using a low calorie calories sweetener with only gram of carbs you will be ahead of the game every single time you use one packet of stevia you are using less sugar and you will not even miss it br br the rebecca review ,look for the , not as good as i be
this was my favorite stevia product and i had it on subscribe and save until i customer service about nunaturals gmo use yes nunaturals uses gmo products so i have canceled my subscribe and save order and am now using a href http www amazon com gp product b u stevia clear liquid extract ounce container pack of a ,used to be my favorite , great product
maybe my tastebuds are different but i bought this at a local store and i am not completely sold on it i tried it in my tea and it did leave me w an aftertaste just like most sweetners ,meh , great tea
i hated stevia and it is licorice taste until i tried nustevia since that day i have almost completely eliminated sugar in my drinks i like that it is a plant based product and not no after taste and you need very little to make anything taste sweet ,is great , great taste
not taste good i am a for my diabetic dad and once i discovered this product i was hooked except that it is hard to find where i live when i found it at amazon i put it on auto ship so i do not run out the price has gone up a lot since i first found it on amazon however it still costs more in stores if and when i can find it there i make with this which i keep on hand at all times in a gallon container of water i add cup of lime juice and tbsp of stevia powder it is refreshing and almost no calories and no chemical aftertaste my dad uses the stevia in his coffee and his oatmeal i have not tried cooking with it although i know they make one designed for baking which i will possibly try this winter ,i love this stuff , best i have ever had
the nunaturals white stevia with maltodextrin several months ago as i am trying to cut back on sugar and artificial sweeteners the first morning i tried it in my coffee and hated it it tastes just as bitter as equal or sweet n low i decided to give it another try that same day in my lemonade and it was absolutely delicious i have also tried it in hot tea and it is bitter but wonderful in iced tea so i think hot drinks bring out the bitterness in stevia all in all i am glad i bought this and also a box of the packets which are very convenient on the go i have tried many different brands of stevia but so far this is the only one i have not thrown out i also tried truvia not a fan it makes your coffee or tea taste like licorice ,tastes great in iced , excellent for the price
if you are trying to get off sugar this is the product for you i has a great sweet taste without your insulin and no bitter aftertaste great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy i love this product ,great product no bitter taste will not your , great taste
i have tried various brands of stevia but i always come back to nunaturals i buy the ounce container because i use it to sweeten everything if you have a sweet tooth as i do but do not need the added pounds then this is the ticket for you i drink a lot of tea and this is my sweetener a lot of other stevia brands leave a bitter after taste but this is the best that i have found to resolve that problem highly recommended ,great taste and calories , great product
if you need to cut down on sugar this is the way to go i love stevia in my iced tea and it is great on your cereal also great stuff ,than sugar , great tea
i started using nustevia several years ago back then i had to purchase it from a health food store thanks to amazon i can now order and have it within a few days i never run out as for the product it is the best i have tried several stevia products but they have an after taste not with nustevia please try if you t ,best alternative to sugar , great product
i was looking for a healthier alternative to splenda and equal nustevia taste great and this container lasts a long time ,great taste and great value , great taste
stevia is pretty much the only natural zero calorie sweetener there is but most of the time the powdered stevia is so bitter not nustevia nustevia has absolutely no bitterness and tastes exactly like real sugar it is amazing add it to plain yogurt you have an amazing guilt free dessert breakfast side dish snack add it to tea coffee recipes anything it is a truly magical product and it is cheaper in the oz container on amazon than anywhere else they also sell it at but it is for oz also for drinks i highly recommend the extremely potent liquid stevia as sometimes the powdered version takes a while to dissolve in iced beverages it eventually does dissolve though ,the world best sweetener , great taste
after years of using synthetic sweeteners like equal and sweet n low i realized their long term effects and wanted to find a good alternative nustevia was a lucky it has virtually no bitter it is all natural and i have been using it exclusively for more than a year now it works in both hot and cold beverages and comes in bulk and in packets for portability i have not used it for baking and probably will not because the chemistry of most recipes depends on sugar or something similar to get a good effect however for daily use in beverages this product is very good ,best stevia product i have found , great product
i was quite skeptical about stevia at first but tried it with another brand and thought there was not much difference in taste and i felt better about using a more natural product than the other artificial sweeteners out there i then started looking at getting a bulk container and happened upon this product i now have purchased this same product times and am quite pleased the product is a bit more concentrated and we are using less of the product in our drinks and cooking than other competitors br br the deliveries are always quick and we have not had any issues at all with the product or packaging ,sweet stuff , not as good as it is
we love this and use it as a sugar substitute in just about everything beverages desserts cooking it is not at all bitter even in hot drinks like coffee for baking there are good substitution online that tell you how much stevia to use per cup of sugar if you need to replace the bulk of sugar in a recipe you also have to add homemade apple fiber to make it work my kids do not notice the switch and i feel good about using it because it is all natural ,great product , great stuff
i am so happy i discovered this product i had tried several other brands in extract and powder form and nunaturals is by far the best virtually no aftertaste quick dissolving and convenient it is also very economical at cents a serving i use a teaspoon measuring spoon and it sweetens my coffee or tea perfectly do yourself a flavor and get this stevia powder you will be happy you did ,the best i have ever had , best tea ever
i discovered this product a couple of years ago and really liked the taste in coffee tea and on fruit and oatmeal it was a lot less expensive in the packets then but i have switched to the large oz container and the price is very good i do not use sugar and this helps me have the sweet and not the increased blood sugar yeah ,best taste ever , great product
i love this stevia i have tried many different kinds over the years and this one is my fave goes great in my coffee and tea i have this one on auto ship and get one a month makes it pretty cheap too ,great product , great product
i have tried every brand of stevia on the market and this is hands down the very best out there i use nu naturals nustevia for all sweetening purposes it can be hard to find even in health food stores and the ones that carry it usually charge a premium i was delighted to find it on amazon com for a very reasonable price even less when obtained through a standing order ,sweet , best ever
this stevia is the best tasting we have ever tried it also mixes into beverages more thoroughly than some others the service from this buyer was prompt the product arrived on time and in excellent condition would order from them again and recommend them to others linda ,the best stevia , best ever
i ordered this after having much success with their liquid products it is not bitter at all and has a very fresh clean taste to it i have baked with it used it on the stove and in my oatmeal and hot cocoa when i run out i will be ordering more ,love this stuff , good hot cocoa
nunaturals stevia is the only sweetener that i use in my beverages and cooking i have tried other brands and this one is the best it has not any odd taste and tastes better than sugar to me i buy the large ounce container and it lasts me for months i only wish they would put this in more products sold at the grocery stores there is a soda that has stevia in it that i purchase at a health food store called zero and it comes in different flavors it is great and i do not have to be concerned about the sugar content that is in traditional sodas this product is great and i think is the best of stevia products on the market ,the only sweetener i will use , great taste
i find that this jar product works better for people without as much in their hands vs using opening sweetener packets this product works well both in cold hot things like homemade lemonade in coffee easy to open lid product dissolves more easily in cold liquids than many other types of stevia ,great sweetener , good stuff
i used to buy this product in this size at a health food store in florida for dollars where i moved to in ny i could not find it in the stores so i looked online with shipping costs it still cost under dollars br br i use this product in tea and coffee and i like it better than real sugar i do not find it bitter at all even when i put a little too much in ice tea sometimes i forget it is not real sugar when it is in ice tea i especially like that it has no other additives for texture or taste i have used it in baking simple pound cakes and cookies and they were good ,best stevia product i ever used , not as good as i be
love sweet things and without them i do not think i would have been able to stay on the low carb diet i have been unable to eat sugar for a long long while i had previously switched to natural sweeteners like honey and agave but when i discovered they were not on the low carb diet i would switched to i had to find something else to use as a substitute nustevia products are what i chose i tried several other types of stevia but nustevia products seem to be the best so far the bitter aftertaste associated with most stevia products is almost completely absent from nustevia products br nustevia white stevia powder is super sweet so you will have to use it sparingly and one bottle lasts a very long time br i m very happy with the product and will be buying it again and again ,satisfying , great taste
the first time i tried this product was years ago at the restaurant in las vegas having a cup of tea with some friends we all how delicious and tasty it made our tea we have been using it ever since a little goes a long way and i use it anytime i would use a sweetener since the artificial sweeteners are so and unhealthy and i have a sweet tooth i felt this was a safe alternative not only is it safer but there is no aftertaste and does not raise your blood sugar level this particular stevia has absolutely no bitter taste to it i have tried others before and since and there is no comparison ,the best stevia , great product
very happy with the product in a taste test for the price it ranks very high delivery was prompt and as expected ,great inexpensive , great
love this on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and or even dill great way to enjoy caviar and not break the bank ,great red tasty and on , great product
roland red caviar is excellent the price is good and affordable it makes a good presentation for company and tastes very good i purchased many items from amazon even large ticket items and i am very satisfied with the products and service ,another great experience with amazon , great product
i bought this pack to have some inexpensive caviar to use for garnish over the holidays the other night i decided to go ahead and use one for some dip it was so bad i could not believe it it was not spoiled it just had an odd flavor with a terrible aftertaste it did not even taste like caviar i threw the jar away ,worst ever , not as good as it is
this stuff is not bad at all but you know how you can just eat spoon after spoon of really good caviar without toast points or crackers or anything this is more for sprinkling over fish dishes morning eggs or a salad all in all for the price it is pretty good ,great as a on your , not as good as it is
i use red caviar in a couple of dishes and this brand is as good as any i have found though the red coloring is perhaps a little much ,little , great product
i ordered this for gifts around christmas time i actually was hoping to use it for our christmas day meal two out of the four jars i ordered were rotten and inedible i never did get to try it and i was very annoyed and disappointed ,disappointing , good stuff
this stuff sounded perfect way too much red and no taste according to me and my friends who tried it kind of salty basically i would stay away from it i am tempted to toss it out but paid too much to feel right about it ,too much red and too little taste other than that it is great , best ever
because they brought bagels to america without which we never could get maximum level of enjoyment out of this delightful low cost caviar caviar for breakfast we use the small soft plain bagels cut in two upon which we smooth a bit of cream cheese then a nice ring of caviar in the center of which is colorful and delicious cut up hard cooked egg then add a perfect cup of coffee this is is best done on a week end so it can be ever so slowly no stress involved pure luxury yes yes yes yes yes ,all the , good but not great
not knowing what to expect i decided to take a chance since it was not that expensive i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the caviar i put this stuff on just about anything i could and it was amazing i do not know too much about caviar but for this price i do not think anybody can complain ,every , not as good as it is
this is a joy to serve on my mini potato pancakes with sour cream and then a teaspoon of this caviar on top soooooo tasty and pretty for christmas thanks for offering it ,wow a great deal love love love it , great product
caviar taste awful maybe it is because i bought from a cheaper brand or maybe because is just bad no matter who you buy it from or how much you paid for it why do people like to waste money on these things ,yuck , not as good as it is
all of the roland products are top quality roland caviar is the real deal unlike some other brands that are really made from seaweed ,great price quality , great product
if u have not tried this u r missing the best thing u could cook for your family i give this stars ,the family loved it , great coffee
cooked in healthy coconut oil that is why it stays crunchy will not give you side effects of vegetable oil oxidized cholesterol and free when you eat foods fried in canola soybean or corn oil ,best for on the snacks and health , the best
thought these were the larger sized ones you see in stores but i was mistaken these pops are about inches long and a little less than inch wide flavors are comparable to flavor ice not necessarily better my wife and i enjoy these throughout the year instead of ice cream but we can only find them in our local grocery store during the summer months glad we can get them via amazon these were on sale for per box of with free shipping so i think we got a good value without the sale pricing i am not sure if we would choose these over another brand but if they do go on sale again we would probably buy them again not bad just a little small eat two ,smaller than expected , not as good as i be
these are a cheap alternative for summer when everyone wants a cold treat superior flavor and size than the ice case ,the price these are great for all even a much better than the smaller , great for
we first tasted this coffee in the hotel coffee shop in costa rica while on vacation we bought a few bags and brought them back home with us costa rica grows arabica coffee beans fantastic we enjoy good coffee and it is best in the morning it is strong flavorful full bodied and not bitter in our cup drip coffee maker we use two rounded scoops about tbs when we finished the last of the coffee we looked on amazon and found the exact brand we had purchased in costa rica we bought four bags and will be getting more ,coffee , great coffee
forget starbucks peets or anything else this is the real deal like a good vintage wine britt coffee is truly gourmet with no after taste i am really fussy about coffee and generally avoid it but after a trip to costa rica fell in love with the beverage again you have to use a french press to get the full favor so throw away those other coffee making your beans deserve the best your taste buds deserve the best too no i do not work for britt and did not get paid to say this but if you guys at britt read this send me a sample or two ,tasting coffee , good coffee but not a great price
this coffee is the smoothest dark roast coffee i have ever tasted and it was a pleasure to sip this full bodied coffee before breakfast and after dinner ,coffee from amazon com , good coffee
i love this coffee like the other reviewers i took a trip to costa rica and was immediately addicted to this bold flavorful coffee i am a cover lover and have tried many different brands only to find that britt is hands down the best i have ever had i brought back one bag from costa rica and have started ordering my supply because i cannot go back to other bland store bought coffees definitely worth a try you will not be disappointed ,best coffee ever , great coffee

my husband and i took a vacation to costa rica and had a wonderful time the whole time we were there we drank there britt dark roast and loved the taste there was no bitter after taste plus i normally drink decaf and noticed with the britt regular dark roast it did not bother me at all i do not have to order decaf anymore and can enjoy the regular i now order it on line and find it to be the best tasting coffee i have ever had br thanks for growing the best coffee beans in the world ,happy customer , good coffee
great tasting one of the best i have ever had the problem here is the high shipping costs ,great taste , great taste
my husband and i fell in love with cafe britt coffee while we were in costa rica upon our return we were delighted to see that we could order it through amazon com the coffee is easy to drink not bitter or harsh and is a great way to start your day highly recommended ,fantastic coffee , good coffee
i used to use this coffee after we visited costa rica and gave some to my aunt she thinks it is the best coffee there is so i gave her some for christmas it is excellent ,my favorite , great coffee
i first tried britt dark roast when i was in costa rica it has a lot of rich flavor but it is not bitter at all i have bought br it by the case ever since it is really no more expensive than those gourmet brands you find at your local store this is br simply the best coffee i have ever had and i have tried many supposedly special ones over the years ,excellent coffee , great coffee
i would never have ordered this had i known i was only going to be sent and one of them was open and leaking powdered spice out i complained to amazon and i know from experience that they always have awesome customer service since i just got my package today and just opened it now i have to wait a bit to hear back from them on this issue will keep you updated i just wanted you guys to know that even though it states packets it is not must be a misprint double check with amazon before you order this what sounds like an awesome deal is a meh deal if you are getting only of them ,not only , not as good as it is
i used super gold luster dust to create the most exquisite chocolate leaves for the cake at my son wedding by using an to lightly coat the molded leaves with luster dust the result was beautiful in contrast to food coloring the luster dust on easily and imparts a metallic color and sheen the containers are small but the product goes a long way making it extremely economical to use a href http www amazon com gp product the step dynamic a powerful for successfully growing your business a ,cake , not as good as it is
i have used this product multiple times in fact i purchased four tubs of the gold and silver luster dust each five years ago and i am just now running out i use this stuff to all sorts of things for themed including an entire roast duck and then using vodka onto it the clients thought it was food it looked so beautiful i cannot recommend this stuff enough ,the inexpensive alternative to leaf , not as good as it is
i purchased this item for a cake that called for gold dust never thought i would find it but im glad i did when i sprinkled it on it looked like a shining star the container is small but it will go a long way worth buying ,star , not as good as it
this product allows me to make some really big when providing spiced nuts at gatherings the fact that the gold spreads so easily allows me to use just a little but show off people are amazed that this is edible gold ,is awesome , not as good as it is
i found this product doing a search for edible gold leaf i decided to purchase after reading rave reviews about food items that were created using it however it is clearly marked not to be consumed and for decorative use only so this is a misleading product ,not edible , not as good as it is
point it is medium br br are you just thinking about trying a hormel for the first time ok then just remember these reviews on amazon particularly food reviews are all simply opinions of customers no scientific analysis intended i hope br br compleats are quick easy except for the plastic off the top and generally edible there is not a whole lot more to say about them i eat them because i am an old guy living alone and too often i am just lazy these do come in handy for a quick light meal light depending on your appetite and the size of your tummy br br this is a good one to lead off with if you are just now getting into compleats just note that in my opinion it is middle of the road for the line not a lot of flavor but goes down ok ,it is fast it is food , not as good as i like
i have tried several of the compleats line including this one and they all have one thing in common the picture on the box looks like a lot of food with a moderate amount of sauce on it but the box actually contains a moderate amount of food with a lot of sauce on it br br the chicken and rice flavor has some shredded chicken with rice carrots and peas and a whole lot of flavored sauce it is very salty but not lacking in chicken flavor the texture of all of the ingredients is decent neither too firm nor too mushy except for the ratio of sauce to solid food being too overall i would say it is fine in a pinch these shelf stable meals are easier to find than most but if you have other options available these are only fair to ,not bad , not as good as it is
these treated dinners that do not need freezing are a great convenience i have tried quite a few of the hormel compleats and this is one of my favorites home it t and it is a bit too salty but for a satisfying meal in seconds it is hard to beat the only reason i have given this flavorful decently chicken filled dish stars instead of is because the rice is white we all know by now that whole grains are healthier so until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice i will mark them down ,tasty quick meal , not as good as i be
i subscribe to several hormel compleats this is definitely the best flavored dinner i have tried i am planning to double my subscription ,i am a fan , best ever
like the majority of other meals in the hormel line this one is excessively salty that alone is tolerable though if only the meal was not in sauce this ends up being more like a soup than a rice meal which is an utter shame because everything else is fairly nice and the amount of sauce ruins it br br but it is very quick and easy to make and fills you up so even a blah meal like this fits the bill it is not my favorite of this type of meals but i would not turn it down for lunch one hungry afternoon ,great bad , great product
me and my wife have tried a wide range of the hormel compleats and this is by far the worst tasting one of the bunch i could complain about the lack of chicken but the horrid taste even br that minor drawback i know its a cheap meal but i do expect something at least a little edible if you are looking to the compleats then go with something at least worth you money pick up the far superior tasting spaghetti or turkey dinners and feed this thing to the family dog ,not very good , not as good as it is
not so sure about this product chicken and rice is not really what there is sure there is some chicken and some rice but mostly gravy all in all i still like it ,chicken and rice , not as good as it is
not bad but like others say a bit too salty i do notice a strange after taste tho i like better and will not buy this again ,thick soup , not as good as
this is a soup rather than the meal on the outside there is very little taste and very little chicken it is mostly rice in a weak chicken stock thickened with potato and corn starch br br it is not bad if you want a light convenient snack br br the chef meals are tastier and more substantial and also more convenient because you just have to pull off the lid which comes away easily with these hormel compleats you have to pierce the top first and then peel it off afterwards which is not so easy especially as it is hot ,not a lot of flavor not a lot of chicken , not as good as it is
these dinners are as close to perfect as can be found here in the quick easy and delicious ,are simply wonderful , good
i am not so sure why the other guy did not like this so much i love it in fact it might just be one of my favorite foods around it is tried and true rarely cooks wrong and always good to warm the belly and soul i only but this flavor it is so good why from it i have tried other brands before bit makes the best ramen noodles in all of time ,the best around , great stuff
this is ramen a cheap easy and fast noodle meal that is pretty cheap its got its pros and cons but mostly its pretty alright the chicken flavor is good some people find it too salty i like it as is the price here on amazon is comparable to some groceries when its not on sale higher than others still if you are like me and want to avoid the stores as much as possible maybe paying a more for is not such a big deal nutritionally its pretty meh you could do a lot better but its also a versatile base you can always add lots of veggies meat other spices pretty much anything to this to it up and make it a better meal option we keep it in the house for quick lunches when no one wants to cook a meal just for themselves ,okay price fast easy , not as good as it is
a good lunch for me being easy to make cheap and the chicken flavor is one i remember but i havent had it in a long time its one of the only flavors sold in stores where i live i made some recently its better than i remember salty but good this is one of the more flavors i recommend not adding cups of water i added a bit more than cup and it was perfect or seems to be the perfect amount i like eating it as a soup so i dont pour out the water you can add things to ramen like meat eggs or vegetarian protein and frozen veggies to make it a more filling meal or eat it plain or dont use the seasoning packet and add your own seasonings whatever you like this is a great product i recommend if you want easy cheap lunches ,good , i love it
this is a classic ramen choice our kids love this when we are we have a case of this on hand a bowl some water and in the microwave and we have got our instant meal we break up the noodles while still sealed in the package this helps the kids not make a mess when trying to eat them they do not seem to of these and we are not overly by the nature of the just add water product we each had our ramen eating college days these also make a great item to have on hand in a desk drawer for the days you forget your lunch etc at work just make sure you have a pack of paper not save the bowls and some fork spoons in that drawer too ,a good choice , great product
if you want a hot meal with no effort that is this is the way while cooking noodles microwave left over meat hot dog sp also microwave a spoon or two of vegetable left over frozen canned after noodles cook add season packet pour over meat veg after a minute pour some of the liquid out you have a wonderful meal with less sodium because you poured it out college kids live off this meal because it is cheap quick and can all be done in microwave if need be you can get a case of libby peas from amazon for about since you are using only a spoon or two lasts a long time ,fantastic hot meal , best ever
a bit dry but still good they may be perfectly all right i just thought the noodles were hard and dry br i m still enjoying them ,chicken , good
the taste is not good at least is not good for japanese and chinese br its taste is basically sort of american japanese taste br plus the price is not competitive br br i d suggest never buy it ,not good , not as good as it
i ordered this pack sampler and i have to say that i really do like the flavor of the donut shop pods they are mellow smooth and have virtually no bitterness i just cannot believe how fresh they manage to keep their pods i give them four stars because i prefer freshly roasted and ground but to date when i am in a hurry in the mornings which is most mornings i reach for a pod of donut shop ,so far are the best pods i have tried , good but not great
with this spice mix you can the taste of your favorite restaurant stews it is potent so do not use too much it smells heavenly perfect for both meat and bean stews ,taste at home , great product
if you like garlic this is for you i have been making this as a dip with greek yogurt and reduced fat mayonnaise i usually add chopped spinach to it and serve it with and chips i have gotten rave reviews from my friends my only complaint is that it consists of dried vegetables and a powder and it is difficult to make sure they are equally distributed when measuring it out ,yum , great product
i have been eating the mcdougall right foods for a few years now and this is by far the best it takes exactly the way the name suggests it tastes great with cooked vegetables such as broccoli and and it is very easy to make the only problem i have with it is that the noodles are not thick enough for me but i think one time i let them sit in the microwave a little longer and they became thick other than that i would recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy and who enjoys noodles and peanut flavor ,yum yum , great stuff
span class tiny length mins br br span skip the thai go for this br edit this soup has moved up to the spot when i in dr mcdougall today i am glad because i want to order this for a while and do not want this soup to be seen as by right foods dr mcdougall ,why is this soup so , not as good as it is
i love the mcdougall asian eacute es and although i have not tried all of them this one is amazing it has a really flavor that you would not expect in a product containing only grams of fat per serving i would imagine these would make a great dinner added to a pound of mixed stir fry vegetables i am buying a case now to test just that the peanut flavor is strong enough that i bet it would among a fair amount of vegetables or tofu when added so you would not get very noodles and dry veggies br br i recommend this product the best tasting peanut noodle you will be able to find for only grams of fat ,one of my favorites , great product
this is a very tasty item my wife does not eat meat and had to stay br in a hotel for weeks during a training she i had this shipped br to her and she raved about the great flavor and wanted more ,love this , great taste
sure i could have gone on a food at the local grocery to find a similar product but i do not think i would have found a product as good and tasty as dr mcdougall the noodles are quick and easy to prepare and above all else tasty enough to satisfy my appetite i was surprised that there were enough peanuts in every bite just like at a thai food restaurant overall i am pleased with my order and the quality of the product ,quick easy and tasty , great product
these are super tastey i would definitely recommend the only reason i am not giving stars is because i wish they were bigger d ,yum , good
super tasty quick meal it is a bit small but perfect for a lunch on the go definitely not going to help you with any dinner hunger though br br the sodium is a little higher than i would like but i really cannot beat it for and efficient ,love it , great taste
i like the concept and i like asian food but the roasted peanut noodle variety of this mcdougall entree does not have enough peanut flavor for me sauce is rather thin too and the flavor fine just not sure i could it as peanut i will try a different variety next time i think ,it is ok , best ever
tastes great price is okay received in timely manner but two of the soup packages were bent hope the price comes down ,in delivery , great taste
the soup standing time will be almost over it needs a few minutes to thicken up take a tablespoon of the broth and a tablespoon of water add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl toss the veggies in the liquid and microwave for about minute seconds when through dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious healthy meal the men in my office come around when the aroma of the soup comes out of the microwave several are now also fans despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan when i am enough to remember to wash and bring it in i add a spring onion on top i just use an office scissors to cut it if you can afford the calories a few drops of toasted sesame oil is a nice addition as well as is yummy ,great for a healthy hot great tasting vegan meal on the go , great for a great price
of the noodles i guess i was hoping for a bit more than ramen with peanut sauce br br i only gave this three stars because i thought it was a bit of a let down i liked it but i did not love it as much as i should have given my love of peanut sauce i would maybe buy it again at a grocery store if it was on sale but i certainly do not see myself buying them in bulk from amazon my go to desk drawer food is still annie noodle soup bowl the calorie count is pretty similar i think annie is like or so but the texture of the noodles is far superior because they use the vacuum sealed pre cooked noodles however if you are not in the mood for soup these peanut noodles may be a better way to go after all ,cup of , not bad but not as good as it is
first time i have tried this item it is just ok the broth is tasty but the noodles are pretty bland to me ,not bad but not too much flavor , not as good as
the noodles for this product are what make me gag i am not a fan of this meal at all and i lt asian food for those looking for a delicious snack who are not already vegan i would either a go try first or b skip buying this package as it is not delicious ,not good , good for you
i read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy decent tasting cup of noodles needless to say i found this not to be true first the consistency is gross and second the taste is awful maybe i am just not accustomed to eating crap think twice before ordering this product i wish i did ,horrible , not as good as it is
these papers are great they leave a delicious strawberry taste on your lips even the glue tastes good ,delicious , great snack
these smell so good and are cute and a great size with a in the middle to help roll and holds together really well with tasty glue definitely recommend smell like strawberry bubble gum does not really affect flavor too much but better than plain ones and very sweet box says printed with soy so it is clean and i do not have to worry about ridiculous chemicals for the ,great , good but not great
love this soup i have been eating this soup for a long time i have tried several different soups with these same types of ingredients and this one is the best by far however i will not order it from amazon again i ordered a case two different times and the first time of the cans were dented the second order the worker delivered it to me in a plastic trash bag because cans were busted open the other cans were dented with the labels coming off of them because of getting wet from the soup that had leaked from the busted cans it was a huge mess to clean up they need to package items better amazon did issue a full refund but after having out of shipments being damaged i am not willing to order soup or any other food items from them ,love the soup , best ever
this coffee supposedly is premium it tastes watery very thin not good at all maybe old br not sure it was a waste and i am using it line the bottom of my sitting and trash cans and on to absorb the smells so i used it but not to drink do not buy ,weak coffee not good for a premium product and price , not as good as it is
excellent very nice rich and creamy with the nut in the middle delish ,chocolate , good
if you want a good quick cooked sauce without excess acidity these are the ones to use the real san marzano beware of ,best of the canned , great product
these tomatoes have a deep and rich flavor and a nice acid to sugar balance though you may need to enhance this when making a sauce it is pretty obvious when you pull these tomatoes out of the can that they were picked at their due to their deep red color and soft texture many tomatoes advertise themselves as san but since sm is a type of tomato they could have been grown anywhere not these these are sm tomatoes grown in the san marzano region of italy in perfect for growing tomatoes i have no with cento i just love a perfect tomato sauce use these tomatoes be sure to not cook the sauce for more than minutes and you will see what i mean even using fresh locally grown in season tomatoes i have not been able to get the depth of flavor that i do with the ,best sauce canned or fresh , great product
i wanted to make authentic italian pizza at home so i ordered this and flour these tomatoes are amazing and taste just the tomatoes at our favorite italian pizza restaurant the label says there is basil in it but i did not detect or in taste any basil this stuff is awesome i ordered another cans shipping kills though ,pizza , not as good as it is
my sister and i did a blind taste test with these to see if the price was worth it and we could not tell the difference between these and the two other brands i had on hand i would not buy them again ,we could not tell the difference in a taste , not as good as it is
as i was growing up my mother always made apple sauce cake for every birthday and special occasion after i was diagnosed with celiac i began trying to make a cake that was like the one my mother made after years i gave up trying then i saw this mix in the store years ago and got very excited with the when i make the cake i the mix recipe a little i add to the dry mix cup coco cup chopped walnuts and raisins i use large eggs cup apple sauce cup of oil and cup water instead of what is listed on the bag this cake and the chocolate cake mix also made by are our family favorites this includes my husband and children who are not celiac and are very picky eaters ,spice cake , great product
i served this wonderful cake at a christmas party at my house as the only celiac in the crowd i decided to wait until the others had tried it before that it was gluten free everyone raved over the great taste the package included directions for making the mix into a carrot cake which is how i served it my own two boys said it was the best cake i had ever made including the traditional wheat flour cakes i sometimes make for the rest of my family it was moist spicy and rich it reminded me of the cakes my grandmother made when i was growing up and she was a terrific cook i highly recommend this one ,can this really be gluten free , not as good as i be
this product arrived with the seal in place and in good condition after nearly months in iraq being able to shake pepper out of this thing and smell it in the air is heaven compared to the tiny little pepper packets they give us that have little to no taste i really do love the smell of this pepper and it tastes great you may be better off buying it in the grocery store and not paying for shipping if you can manage that though ,smells great , good stuff
not wanting to pay per pound at the local for black jelly beans i came to my favorite online store amazon with free shipping i could not beat the price i went from paying per pound to per pound i was afraid that maybe the good deal meant that they were stale but to my suprise they were fresh and delicious i bought them for my mother for mother day because she did not get a chance to buy any for easter with pounds i had plenty to share with my friends too ,delicious black jelly beans , great product
these jelly beans are wonderful they are smaller than regular jelly beans but that does not take away the flavor i would these to anyone ,fantastic , good
years before giving up on sugar and honestly have never had any with this good a flavor also their customer service is excellent i needed to contact them and they were very and also willing to do just about anything to make sure even one customer is happy something lacking in most companies these days br to compare i tried a couple jelly belly licorice ones and to me they had a fruit flavor that was just wrong not enough of a licorice taste is less expensive this way and superior in every aspect of a licorice jelly bean this is a large quantity keep that in mind when purchasing either have a lot of jelly bean lovers in your life or a large family or collection of friends to share with unless of course your sweet tooth will not stop and then just savor them all yourself br enjoy ,best licorice jelly beans ever , a little too sweet
i never got the product and complained about the non receipt so i bought some in the store ,i never got it , good
soy milk is scrumptious and this variety has some extra nutrients added it is a great nutritious high calcium no cholesterol product at a great price buy a case ,scrumptious , great product
makes nasty loose poo the dry food does the same thing i have tried the adult version and the puppy version and both gave my adult dog and my puppy super soft and stinky stools ,makes nasty loose , my dog loves it
this product is very good it goes a long way but quite as good as the one at dd good product not the less ,very good , good
i have purchased locally many other flavors of da syrups and ordered blueberry online to try it because it isnt available locally and i love blueberry well this was a disappointment to me very very sugary sweet with little blueberry flavor not to mention i paid x what i would pay locally br very disappointed ,sugar free syrup , not as good as it is
i am a big fan of most of the freeze dried fruit and veggies they are crunchy and flavorful and have nothing added the tomato are extremely dry and tough more like old sun dried and for me they are only good when used in cooked dishes i do appreciate that these are organic ,just ok , good
i absolutely love the just tomatoes slices i thought the bits might be good for soups etc but they do not seem to have the same sweet flavor of the slices i will these up but go back to the slices on the whole a great product ,prefer the whole , not as good as it is
i toss some of these in soups or hydrate in a bit of hot water and add to salads or salad dressings they add a nice somewhat meaty flavor almost like bacon bits but healthy to almost any dish ,nice to have in the , the best

i cannot believe i am the first to review this great product br br we have been using a href http www amazon com gp product b earth best organic infant formula with iron ounce canister a which is also a great product up until our little started showing signs of lactose intolerance after with the pediatrician we started searching for a suitable alternative br br soy formulas are being offered as the lactose free alternative by many our first preference was non soy alternative we also wanted a natural organic product free of those nasty chemicals and ingredients after a considerable amount of research and shopping around we found this was the best choice out in the market that was both lactose free and natural organic br br our little one also took to this formula very well and doing a lot better on this formula ,a great product , great product
you can find this pack for dollars less at com no reason they should be charging this much ,buy , good
lactose free baby only formula an instant hit my son loves it he gobbles it down all oz in once shot before with the similac soy he would have to take a break in between my wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy well if adults like it i am sure babies would too i am very happy thus far with our choice we were going to get best but read that the way they extract their dha is not ideal glad i realized that so far so good we always thought that our baby would be stuck with soy formula thank to the similac recall and some good old fashioned parent we realized that is not the case i am happy about that since soy can cause some problems babies and adults alike thank you baby only for making an excellent product ,best organic milk out there my baby from soy , best baby food i have ever had
when my daughter was an infant she was allergic to something in my breastmilk and was put on which worked wonders for her allergic for my son we were therefore very careful when it came time to picking out a formula to supplement breastmilk his stomach does react when i have accidentally had more dairy than i can tolerate so my pediatrician recommended a lactose free formula especially given our asian background i wanted something organic not soy lactose free and with as clean of a label as possible and this formula all of those my son did not like it at first but now he easily between and formula he has not been gassy nor spit up on it i really wish amazon stocked it ,we are a fan , great for
i love pasta but it does not love me i just do not seem to be able to digest it but this pasta not only tastes great it is so easy to digest and as an added bonus it is healthy low in calories i have now tried every version of this pasta they are all amazing some reviewers complained that the pasta is too firm but that is not the case you simply need to cook it a bit longer than regular pasta then it is light as a because of how wonderful it tastes because it is so light you would think that you were eating homemade pasta almost hard to that this stuff comes out of a box ,absolutely awesome , great product
i eat this pasta every day without guilt i love this pasta i maintain my desired weight without any problem you have to cook this pasta a little longer than normal pasta but it is every bit as good ,pasta lovers , great product

i love this stuff and only get it through amazon it arrived on time and good condition and i enjoy it ,great calorie , great product
just a quick note a very good friend of mine who also weight issues and love pasta turned me on to this product we bought a box at whole foods and i was impressed by the taste but especially by the low calories and high fiber content amazingly it is about cheaper at amazon than at whole foods and being an amazon prime customer saved me on shipping br i ll be back for more soon i love quality and a bargain ,real pasta with half the calories and most of the taste , not as good as it is
love this pasta i mix this with regular pasta for a meal half and half love the lower calories and the fiber content ,great pasta , great product
my husband and i have been on a low carb diet for two years and i miss pasta most of all we have tried other low carb pastas and were not crazy about them but we loved fiber gourmet the taste is between white and whole wheat pasta unlike other low carb pastas we did not experience any side effects in terms of digestive issues if you know what i mean i cannot wait to try other products from fiber gourmet ,fabulous , great taste
love this pasta does cook up a little firm cooked it a bit longer had it with very good my husband could not tell the difference so i know it is good he is very fussy ,light , great product
i tried them many times and simply could not get the same pasta eating experience i eat half the box at a time which is about ozs and it is so filling i cannot eat more if i wanted it keeps me all night i do not even get the urge to snack this is like a miracle to me even my children who are the absolute eaters in the world love this pasta and will eat it in substitute for the real and unhealthy alternative the other reviews are absolutely correct in that you should cook it minutes longer than you would cook other pasta or even what the box says i am not sure if amazon will like this comment but it is much cheaper on the fiber gourmet web site at about double the amount for the same price on the day i am writing this review ,italian pasta lover this stars , not as good as i be
i am on a low carb diet and have lost pounds i was so tired of eating meat all the time but too nervous to splurge on pasta until i came across this product on amazon i cook it a minute or two longer than the directions and top it with full fat greek yogurt and cheese and one serving is so filling and yummy definitely my cravings and am now on subscribe and save my hubby and son love it too ,fantastic , great product
i do not know how they do it but this product is too good to be true half the calories of regular pasta wow ,fabulous product , good but not great
great product recommended by dr oz we love pasta but not the calories this is much better than whole wheat ,pasta , great product
i brought a box with me to visit my daughter and family br we all fiber gourmet light very much ,i thought it was , great product
it is a good tasting product it does not raise my blood sugar as much as regular pasta but you still cannot eat a whole box and expect your glucose levels will be normal ,light ounce boxes pack of , not as good as it is
first of all it is wonderful to have these pods delivered to my door free of charge on auto delivery they are cheaper than the cheapest senseo pods that i have found target walmart but check out the weight of coffee per senseo pod vs this particular baronet coffee pod not all baronet pods are this weight however so check out the products carefully i guess i had better mention that the coffee flavor is great one order is for three boxes of these pods ,i will never go back to senseo pods as long as these are available , great coffee
this coffee is absolutely horrendous i cannot believe it has any favorable reviews and agree with the other reviewer who positive reviews were written by employees i cannot stress enough how bad this coffee is it does not even taste like coffee the best way to describe it is a cup of chemicals i am really bummed i cannot returned this a complete waste of money it all went in the garbage ,disgusting , not as good as i have
coffee than the senseo pods making for a better stronger more flavorful cup of coffee i use these in my melitta one one also love that each pod is individually packaged so they stay fresh they come in a stand up box dispenser which is nice too i cannot understand the other reviewer here who did not like the coffee i love this decaf it really is the best pod i have found also the value here cannot be beat comes boxes in each order so in each order you get pods and baronet has so many flavors do check on the other baronet flavors though because all the baronet pods are not grams and all the pods do not come individually packaged stick to the gram individually packaged pods you will not be disappointed i get three different baronet coffee pod flavors all on auto delivery highly recommend yum ,big pods great value delicious decaf coffee , not great flavor
the flavor of these pods is horrid i ordered them only because senseo was out of stock for so long and i needed some decaf pods and these had received a couple good reviews which i now suspect were written by baronet employees i have never tasted such awful coffee before a big yuk for baronet ,these are absolutely , good coffee
i am enjoying this coffee but the vanilla is a little overpowering the strength of the coffee itself is very good i can use one packet to make oz cups with the senseo coffee maker so it definitely saves me money plus it is just so easy to make coffee and clean up in the morning ,nice maybe too much vanilla , good coffee
i had been using a href http www amazon com gp product b senseo decaffeinated coffee count pods pack of a in my a href http www amazon com gp product b hamilton beach personal cup stay or go pod brewer a although the senseo coffee is very good i wanted some variety this is what i found and its excellent the vanilla flavor is rich and most importantly leaves no after taste i drink tall cups oz so what i am doing is using of each type the vanilla is strong enough that it still tastes great the senseo decaf is a little cheaper so i do that as a cost saving measure i also signed up for subscribe and save to further reduce cost if you like vanilla coffee and have a pod brewer i am confident you will love this coffee ,rich and flavorful , great coffee
so many different flavors to choose from i ordered this brand for the first time and the taste is wonderful it was the only decaf french vanilla i could find i have decided to switch from my old brand to this one ,great taste , good flavor
this by far the best pudding mix you do not see this on the store shelves everyone seems to just buy milk chocolate pudding and i guess most do not like to cook pudding on the stove it is best when pudding is cooked cooked instant pudding does not equal this ,great dessert , best ever
how come you sent me instant choc fudge pudding br the order told you to send me the cook serve choc fudge pudding br you show the picture of it br why could not send it to me br it makes me wonder if i should order anything else from you br ,serve , not as good as it is
my honey has a serious sweet tooth which i by preparing him a weekly dessert martha white muffin mix is very convenient to prepare because it only requires one half cup of milk which i toss into my cuisinart and la six beautiful muffins with virtually no prep time they are moist delicious and ,quick easy and delicious , great product
i followed the easy instructions and these turned out delicious i ate them all there were only of them i mixed cup of milk into the dry mix and slowly mixed it together i poured the mix into my sprayed cast iron cup muffin pan i cooked them in my small oven and they cooked up nicely they were moist on the inside the mixes were very fresh smelling and had a freshness date well into the pouch is a nice tough plastic one and will keep the mix fresh it is very easy to open also ,easy to make , great taste
we love love love these muffins they are moist and delicious we like them best the day you bake them the nd day they do dry out a bit but are wonderful if you pop them in the toaster oven for a few min to warm them up then they are good as new our only complaint is that they are difficult to find but def worth every penny ,best muffins in the world , great taste
this was my first time muffin mix as well as baking muffins to me the muffins came out a little dry but tasted great and the people i shared them with said they were good too i will more than likely purchase white muffin mix in the future the muffin mix came at an excellent price and i cannot complain br thank you amazon com for having most everything under the sun for sale ,white chocolate chocolate chip mix , great product
i tried the martha white fudge chocolate chip cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies i have ever made either there is someone on the staff of martha white who has a sense of or their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation i wasted my time a lot of money on chocolate and pecans and my effort martha white either needs to this recipe or take it off the website so no other will waste her money and time on these worthless cookies my husband picked up one on his way through the kitchen and within two seconds he came back in and threw it in the garbage ,worst cookies ever , delicious
i brought bottles one i carry in my pocket and the other for home i fell in love with this while on vacation in just a couple drops does the trick packs a ton of flavor but not too hot that it overpowers your food ,love it , great product
good product and decent shipping however the price was and i later found the same item in a local store for what a ,good but way too expensive , not as good as
that it is only a taste of thai is quite accurate cartons are fancy but big for the amount they hold it is definitely enough for a meal but if you are looking for a full carton of food to eat you had better grab two it is tasty enough for a meal but if you can get yourself to an authentic asian supermarket i guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price ie boxes of noodles for and i am not talking about cup o noodles or things you find at american supermarkets but overall my husband and i being the noodle that we are did enjoy these as something new for the palate however we will probably opt to order thai for fresh noodles next time we have a craving ,not bad but it really is just a taste of thai , not bad but not great
it is like eating a large box of paste i enjoy the flavor but i usually cook them and then mix with something else i am eating as it is a no go straight out of the box ,good flavor but , great taste
i simply do not like it it is easy to prepare but when i eat it i feel that i am a lot of artificial ingredients i cannot even finish one fourth of it ,artificial flavor , good stuff
overall this was good but not great the ginger sauce seemed like it need an extra something to get it a fourth star i think i was expecting a little more ginger taste i would buy it again especially if i can find a good way to punch it up just a little more i may try that egg tip ,needs a little something , not as good as it is
the taste of thai coconut ginger noodles are really yummy the coconut and ginger flavors are very mild br br each chinese shaped box conveniently serves as a container one box makes enough for me to have very filling lunches or for my whole family to share as a side dish the kids always at the opportunity to have these br br the only negative thing i can say is that i wish there were not so many separate little seasoning packets to mix in plus the noodles a single combined spice packet would be easier of course one benefit of multiple packets is the ability to leave out a certain spice if you are not fond of it but i like them all ,really good , not as good as it is
we enjoy a taste of peanut noodles they rock that flavor mmm so we decided to try these um ginger not so much nothing really these from any other noodle flavor and the ginger is a bit overpowering br br take this review in stride though if you are a ginger lover and i am not talking island here then these may be right up your just a bit outside for me though if i may mix my ,not so much , good but not great
chance of br br while the coconut ginger variety tastes good it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual taste of thai i would recommend the thai peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced thai flavor and highly recommend the a taste of thai peanut salad dressing added to salads meats or the peanut noodles for a very spicy thai experience br br overall for the taste and quantity the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal speaking in terms of price wal mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper compared to the subscription price but do not seem to carry the coconut ginger variety at least not at the store near me br br if you have not tried this brand of instant noodles yet i think you will be in for a treat ,more than just a taste of thai , not as good as i like
i really like this soup it is mild and i do not like anything that is to hot it is just right has a good flavor and is something i can take to work and pop in the microwave i would buy it again and again ,taste of thai coconut ginger soup , great taste
this is quick easy and portable and i think it tastes great it is my favorite flavor ,delicious , great taste
i bought these at walmart for less then dollars a box there over a box amazon for box of six then you need to add another dollars to your order to get free shipping i would not buy these again could be better if you added chicken or an egg like other reviewers mentioned my box does say gluten free so maybe there are versions ,okay in a , not as good as it is
a year or so ago i use to buy these quite often because they were gluten free last month i decided to order some again and this product no longer says gluten free on the packaging and contains wheat i did not want them to go to waste so i ate one anyway i became very sick i do enjoy this product but will not be purchasing again because of the wheat just a warning for those of you who also have issues with wheat gluten ,now gluten , great for the price
thanks for the egg tip it works very well and really helps this product nevertheless i ended up giving away three of the six containers because i was not thrilled with the nutritional information ,not bad but i will not , not as good as it is
it is very tasty and very easy to make if you are in need of a very quick filling meal and it needs to be gluten free this works out great try the thai peanut one too ,great gluten free quick meal , great taste
we ordered a pack of these and ate through them very quickly my husband and i both like taking them to work for lunch here is my recipe so that i get more protein i a fresh unbroken egg into the box before i leave home in the morning then i add the egg to the water before i cook it at ,easy and delicious , great taste
very tasty gluten free option my kids loved it as it was not too spicy ,gluten free goodness , great product
the thai coconut ginger noodles are quick and easy to prepare you will be with delicious noodles to enjoy by yourself or share as a side dish with another noodle ,tasty and easy , great taste
i liked this so much that i re ordered and will keep br br re ordering ,quick yummy soup , great
much packaging for my liking too many things to throw away and i agree with a previous reviewer that they are kind of big cartons for how much they hold inside the container are packages one for noodles and three for various seasonings then you have to add water they give you a fill line but it is kind of then microwave for minutes then stir then microwave again for one minute the one from trader joe only has two packets one for noodles one for sauce and no water involved just microwave for minutes and you are done and those are a lot tastier i did not like the texture of this thing everything clumped together too much and it really did not have much taste especially considering the three different packets of seasoning i put in time to try a couple of the other brands of these things ,eh , not as good as i like
i bought these for my son to take to work for lunch apparently his co workers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again maybe it was a bad batch ,horrible smell , good for you
i do not plan on reordering it but it was definitely edible and filling since i added chicken ,for a box it is okay , not as good as
resemble thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste plus the noodles stick together even when prepared as suggested and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them br br also the nutrition label is misleading i am dieting and read labels very carefully this says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs oz half a cup i figured as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving that after adding water there would be one serving per package not so one package is actually two servings or over calories this is far more than any other pre packaged noodle meal i have seen br br the excessive calorie content might have been ok had the product tasted good but it doesn t i would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess ,tasteless , not as good as i like
this is a great and delicious way to eat food at home just melt the entire packet if you like it spicy into two cans of coconut milk in a pan then add your favorite meat and veggies i usually use chicken strips and a bag of frozen asian veggies ,yum , delicious
while the restaurants always do it best these curry are pretty tasty it is easy to use fast and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice for those of you scared of something spicy you might use a little less but for most it is just right and for those that like it you can add a little crushed red pepper since the coconut milk has to be added separately you can also control the fat content you can go light or go with the much creamy stuff i find the green curry is a little sweeter than the red and panang and is maybe a little less spicy ,tasty and so easy , great taste
much hotter than your normal green curry one pack makes many servings ,hot hot hot , great
used to use another brand that changed in a jar but this is so much better has a very pleasing hot spicy taste with a hint of lemon lime and a good amount of heat it is a little too salty though if you like to use a fair amount to spice it up we wish it had a lower sodium content while made from scratch with fresh ingredients is always better this is the next best thing really good with chicken beef pork tofu and veggie dishes quick and easy to make good for you meals we do not like the packaging and wish it were in a jar but other than that and the sodium content we like it will buy again ,very good thai green curry , not as good as it is
second order very good hot which i like but best to sample as per your preferences ,curry paste , great taste
i was really impressed with this there are many flavors and quite a bit of heat with this and your favorite brand of milk you can make some great thai at home ,of flavor very spicy excellent , not as good as it
different flavors for different people not everyone is going to like this just as others like me will love this coffee br br it totally subjective br br i give it stars i enjoy this coffee a lot and the price is very reasonable in my opinion it my local big box grocery store ,house blend is good coffee , good coffee
i was at a star hotel and was served this tea during a meeting it was fantastic i asked the if they could get me the name of the company but they were unable thank goodness for amazon i was able to find it it is the best i have had in many years it arrived on time and very securely packed ,my order , great product

this stuff rocks i have had it at two different and i just love it it is tart and really unusual a real treat ,good , great
this is my husband new favorite tea i am not huge on hibiscus but this does taste good i am sure we will be buying more ,new favorite , great tea
nice tea i can steep up too times it has a strong cranberry flavor probably would be good as a cold tea i recommend if you love cranberry ,nice tea very strong flavor , great tea
i found this tea years ago while staying at a resort in washington br br i absolutely love it it is herbal and helps me to relax with its very flavorful taste and color great for as well as the sinus soothing beautiful and delicious br br i have ordered this tea every year from amazon com because the price is amazing and well worth it likewise i have given it to others as a gift when i can afford to br br this tea is wonderful with honey sugar sweetener or just by itself a must purchase for every household also great for on the road for tea drinkers ,best tea ever , great tea
love it love it love it both me and my year old drink this herbal tea quite often very tasty ,delicious , great product
this is very good tea in an elegant a little pricier than some but produces a wonderful flavor whether you are drinking it hot or cold ,delicious cup o tea , great tea
found this product for sale on vacation in north carolina and loved it great maple flavor walmart sold it for for the oz pack wish i would have bought some more while i was there because i am not paying for what walmart can sell for that is just robbery very disappointed in for their insanely high price if price was reasonable would love to buy more and rate much higher ,product is great price is , not as good as it is
i had high hopes when i ordered this tea as years ago in san francisco i used to buy a lovely rose black in which was my favorite tea ever unfortunately this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine i prefer the opposite a full bodied tea i can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof but for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch this might be a good choice ,lacks , great tea
when the costs per pound are the same my dog likes both harmony and newman my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase br br update last batch of harmony farms i ordered had a rancid oil smell when i opened the bag and the pooch would not eat it as readily as he has in the past he would not eat for a day and started checking out the trash i subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods cooked brown rice etc as mix ins to encourage him to make it through this pricey bag not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home but the texas heat can make anything stale rancid yucky quickly i probably should have called customer service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the hot weather here definitely hot weather alternatives ,high quality my dog and my does too , good product but
wrong that the recurring ear infections were caused by an allergy to corn which turned out to be the main ingredient in her food sorry i will get off my and address the issue at hand i found this food by accident the only type the store had was the weight loss formula turns out my dogs love it i have not seen them so and full of energy i have got a and two jack mine are not the off the wall kind mine are mellow laid back kinda they gobble this stuff up and seem to stay full no more begging in the kitchen than normal everyone skin seems smoother eyes are brighter heck i think i will go have a bowl all i can say is if you are looking for a good quality dog food this is the one for you you will not be disappointed ,this is great dog food , great product
had skin problems with a coat when they started to feed her harmony farms she became an eager eater more happy and and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up i m thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food which i think was iams other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time now and they had all been feeding their dogs premium top of the line dogs foods and paying top of the line prices harmony farms products are very reasonably priced not the cheapest dog food on the shelf but in my opinion you are buying the best quality food on the market so it is an incredibly good deal it may also mean you make fewer trips to the veterinarian office i and my friends are so happy we have found this food for our dogs ,i would give extra stars if i could , great for the price
had been feeding my dog beneful which is basically just junk food i switched her off immediately around on amazon to find an all natural food and this fit the bill shipping was free which was awesome and my dog loves the food i worried about that b c i have switched her before and she is been and i have had to top with gravy etc br br do your research it will blow your mind what your pets are eating in regular grocery store dog food it is typically a high ratio of corn which is a filler if you want your pet to live a long and healthy life what they are ingesting should be high up on your list i am glad to have the knowledge now and i really wish i would looked more into this with my two other dogs years and years ago ,awesome ,

i purchased this because of the good reviews and the great ingredients no doubt about the quality of the food and my month old puppy loves it but i realized this does not have dha that helps to develop brain function also the kibble might be little big for a puppy so i believe it is a great food for an adult dog but i would not recommend it for a puppy ,great dog food , my dog loves these

it health wise it has healthy fats and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn and digestion wise the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food we have two dogs we adopted from a shelter and while at first one of our dogs would not eat the food he had worms though so who knows what junk he was eating before he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon he came to love it now they jump when it is dinner time our dogs are happy very healthy have shiny coats and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food we get it on subscribe and save and we usually go through bag p month for reference we have one lb and one husky ,the best food for dogs , great for
months and has a finicky stomach if he eats too fast drinks too fast or eats anything out of his routine he would bring it back up he also would not eat more than a few nibbles at a time the nd is months old and came to us with severe diarrhea vet food did not fix it either he would eat anything and everything if we let him within a day of both dogs being on harmony farms no just a quick switch both dogs digestive issues are gone my oldest the finicky eater is eating his meals without or hesitation my youngest has solid regular bathroom breaks and has been able to relax his water intake as a result they are both more relaxed br we purchase at our local grocery store here in ny for about lb for the price ingredients and results you cannot beat it ,different issues for different dogs , great for my
i read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup br they will not touch it even if i mix it with home cooked food br br they like the dollar store dog food better than this br br amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name ,no good , my dog loves it
these chips are wonderful my kids and i all loved the salt and pepper br each oz bag was calories lots of chips for the calorie count ,yummy , great chips
great packaging and item is just as described will purchase this item again they were shipped very fast and efficient ,great item , great product
just to give a little background i ordered these because they were a great deal for a box of single serving chips and i thought i would give them a try the variety of flavors in this package was great and i enjoy most of them these chips leave a lot less mess than your average bags of potato chips and there are very few crumbs in the bag it is apparent these are not prepared like normal chips and the result is a differently textured chip it will be a personal taste as to whether or not you will like the taste and texture but i would highly recommend trying these out ,excellent chips , great chips
got this item on a one day only sale on amazon love having the single serving portion as i am following ww plan only points plus per serving tasty and on the same line as the special k crackers the variety is nice to have and the box will last for awhile cheddar and bbq are my favorites try them ,perfect for , great product
i discovered pop chips awhile back and fell in love with the bbq flavor whole flavor and satisfying snack or chip alternative hubby is a teacher so he gets lunches made most days with healthier and tastier options than what is offered at school br br since i mix up his sandwiches offerings from week to week i thought the variety pack would be different for him he gets his crunchy fun and does not realize the pop chips are not as bad for you than the reduced fat kettle chips he was getting score plain are fine vinegar pack a tart punch and he really likes the salt and pepper flavor single serve size does leave you wanting more if consuming solo but gives a good amount when enjoying with a sandwich ,variety pack , great taste
i really liked these chips as did my entire family i wish you could pick and choose the flavors in the variety pack i would love to try the sweet potato and chili lime and leave the salt and pepper behind ,loved all the flavor except salt and pepper , great chips
these popchips were something i wanted to try because they were baked the barbeque ones were okay but the rest of them were terrible ,chips , great chips
i like these pop chips a lot but not all the flavors this variety pack makes a good sampler of the various flavors and then you can purchase the flavors you like these chips have strong flavor and are not greasy they are fairly filling and make a great snack they are pretty like most chips so do not take em to the local theater br br these came well packed and they are in stay fresh packaging i can attest that they do keep well for a pretty long time as i found a bag that had gotten pushed behind some other things and after several months it still tasted fine br br these are a pretty good size for a quick snack quality has been consistent over several different batches i really like the texture and crunch and love the lack of ,good as a pack of the flavors , good chips
these tastes good if it is not fried not bad for you and tastes good then why not eat them of course not a lot at once but these are great healthier snacks ,these tastes pretty good , not as good as it
i bought two bags of popchips at whole foods original and barbeque and loved them when i went to amazon to order lots more i liked the idea of single serving bags rather than the larger ones which i would consume too quickly i knew i was taking a risk but when the order came i really disliked about half of the flavors in the assortment in addition only the original and barbeque nutritional values calculated at the others were all i still like popchips but will only buy bags of the flavors i know i will enjoy eating and not have to choke down i recommend that you try a bag of each flavor before you spring for a volume order ,did not care for the variety , great taste
i had only tried the barbeque and sea salt and vinegar flavors that were available at my local target in oz bags i am so glad that i bought this variety pack not only did i discover other flavors that i enjoy but it is single serving size so it is better for portion control i love popchips and i find them way more satisfying than ordinary potato chips ,beware these are addicting , great taste
i like these chips a lot now i have a whole pack this is how i get my chips on while i fish ,yum yum love me pop chips , great chips
something that i had to have for my lunches i love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet i have not found a flavor i did not like being from england i am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as i would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors i cannot complain i also love the fact that fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack my only issue now is that i have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as i do i have now had to go to a box a month but even then i am not sure i can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can ,cannot the taste , i love these chips
good flavorful chips too bad the selection does not include jalape ntilde o or garlic packaging is difficult to open but they fresh ,great chips and tasty too , great chips
these are a great alternative to traditional greasy potato chips great for people that are dieting but still craving a salty crunchy snack they are light and crunchy and they taste really good i was afraid they were going to be like the rice cakes and soy chips but they really taste good the original flavor reminds me a lot of the munchos chips the original flavor and salt vinegar are my favorite but they are all good my least favorite is the cheddar just because it is an overwhelming cheddar flavor i do not like cheddar but most people really like it i have purchased these several times now and i will continue to do so i highly recommend this product for anyone ,delicious alternative to chips , great taste
for all of you potato chips lovers who are trying to eat healthy these chips are a great alternative no they are not like fried but the flavor along with the calorie fat benefits make this a great choice i liked having the variety pack for the opportunity to see which flavors i would like as it turns out i like them all but i do have my favorites like bbq salt vinegar and plain so being able to buy them is an added plus i have already placed two orders since my initial purchase ,great alternative , great chips

i agree with many of these reviews the product tastes good not fantastic but good i do not like real greasy potato chips and prefer baked lays however if you do enjoy real greasy potato chips please see the review pringles and very funny br do buy these if you like an salty snack but do not want to devour a large bag of fat filled chips do not buy these if you are looking for a healthy alternative to chips eat a banana or apple instead and not those apple chips or banana chips because they are high in sugar br if you do get the big box just put it some place inconvenient like the where you will have to some energy in order to get them and if you do bonus you just energy and maybe a chip or two ,pretty good not healthy like an but , i like the chips

popchips is a new product for me ordered after seeing an ad in weight watchers magazine loved the product packing was perfect shipping went fine no complaints with this order at all probably will order again soon ,popchips review , great chips
i have to watch my calories but i tend to not be very successful if the food i eat is tasteless i have enjoyed all six flavors of these popchips and feel great eating them at calories per bag my favorites are sour cream onion and the sea salt and vinegar flavors in fact they are so good i just want to keep eating them and have to resist opening a second bag because that really defeats the purpose i like the variety pack and it is not a bad value ,do not the by eating two bags at once , not as good as i be
the product is exactly what it is to be tasty not yummy but good i received the product promptly i ordered cases and will eat every package ,great for diet , not as good as
i love these chips they taste so good i am on a low cal diet and they are perfect the individual bags keep you honest thank you popchips ,best chips ever , great chips
these are delicious my husband and i just love them especially the bbq and salt and vinegar flavors i like the individual packages it is a wonderful bargain when you get free shipping ,pop chips , delicious
i am a i have to have something during the day to crunch all other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on popchips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too i highly recommend them all but the salt and pepper are my least favorite ,a yummy alternative to high fat chips , great chips
these are the best snacks for me as i am a band patient they fill u up just enough and the small bags are perfect size ,yummy popchips , great snack
yum i had tried the original and the bar b q and really liked them so decided to get the variety pack for whatever reason the pack is cheaper then the the flavored ones do contain a yeast extract which is similar to msg and gave my grandmother a bad headache so if you know anyone that has a sensitivity to msg do not give them these these are tasty and a nice substitute for a greasy potato chip but they are not filling you are better off eating a granola bar ,taste yummy but watch out for extract , great product
a dream for those on weight watchers who love potato chips the individual serving bags of pop chips are only points and taste delicious ,love pop chips , great chips
these are a great size and healthy they satisfy the craving for something crisp and are reasonable calorie wise ,pop crisps , great snack
these chips are great substitute for the usual high calorie ones offered i keep them on hand to aid in my weight loss venture ,great product , great chips
i bought these and tried each flavor i could not even finish any bag but the barbecue i really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross and the texture is really like on a chalk board to me how is this the best selling item amazed to each his own and enjoy but if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind ,did not care for these only liked bbq why these are best , great taste
i cannot believe these are actually decent for you they taste awesome i love these chips they have great crunch and a great amount of flavor i am addicted to these and so is my boyfriend who hates anything that is healthy i recommend these to all my friends i am on the auto refill program but keep having to reorder early since my keeps eating them all ,omg so delicious , great chips
i am on weight watchers and these chips are only points and they taste great i like every kind i use the plain chips to dip with my salsa i would recomend these chips to everyone weight watchers or not ,great chips , great chips
this is a great product i was a chip a holic and knew i needed to cut back on them then i was introduced to pop chips i have found my alternative these chips are great low in fats but high in flavor i a mixed case with multiple flavors and was not disappointed with any of them consider this product for your alternative to the high fat chips available everywhere i am sure these will catch on and become a big hit ,great product , great chips
saw these in whole foods and thought they looked interesting did not care for them instantly but by the time the first bag as gone i have a husband and kids i was hooked wanted to try other flavors and this is a great way to do it personally i like the plain and also the salt pepper my kids love all of them though and while these are not fruit veggies i feel better about giving these to them as opposed to standard chips ,they grow on you , good but not great
we received our assorted single serve packs today this is the first time we ordered popchips they taste so good we are already down by packets between adults and kids br please bear in mind that these chips will in no way compete with regular fried potato chips the low calories per bag is very much a part of why they deserve stars i am sure we will be ordering more yay to finding a new healthier snack alternative ,yummy , great chips
i hesitant about ordering this product simply because i never ordered snacks of the internet so after finally decided to order it it arrived within days the flavor is awesome just like what i hoped for if you like health food or like potato chips but hate thinking about how oily they are after eating them then this product is for you if you are happy with the regular potato chips and does not care about the the oil and calories then stay where you are those chips have so much flavor they kinda remind me of rice crackers but with flavor i have lived in the u k for a while and one thing i have always missed is the crisps that i used to eat in u k those popchips reminded me of the taste of the crisps i will be order those again ,best chips , great chips
i am a huge fan of pop chips they had them at my grocery store but their supply was so i was afraid they were not planning to order more i purchased two cases individual bags of pop chips they are all excellent purchasing them in the variety pack gave me access to flavors they did not have at the grocery store salt and vinegar cheddar salt and pepper i have enjoyed all the flavors barbecue is still my favorite though i also got a better deal buying them online ,perfect pop chips , great chips
i have this on a monthly purchase making the per unit price even lower that list that being said pop chips are very tasty and the variety pack comes with different flavors br br my favorite flavors are salt vinegar by far br br the calorie count makes this snack a very guilt free ,just my , great taste
definitely better than and slightly better than baked chips very tasty but you feel as if you are almost eat something with the same texture as cereal it is a small to enjoy chips albeit faux chips the vinegar and s p ones are nasty ,quite delicious but not as good as real chips , great chips
i bought the flavor variety pack they are pretty good nice thing is that i am not sure if i am crazy about the texture so by the end of an oz bag i do not really want anymore however in my quest for different snack foods i found the food should taste good line of cracker chips my money will be spent on those rather than pop chips however i think that people should give these a try as well ,interesting i have found something else , good but not great
the bbq chips are great we liked them better than regular chips they have a nice crunch hate kettle chips which are so hard that they are like eating shards of glass br br we will definitely be buying more of the popchips ,love these chips , great chips
these really are good i gave some to other people and they liked them too the plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa when eating the bbq flavored ones brings back memories of years when i would eat bbq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range i think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at cal per pack ,great less , good for you
to make sure i limit myself to only bags a day br br they really are good and the nutritional information is not bad at all br br so for those of us who cannot sit down with a big old bag of or utz and just cannot seem to stop ourselves from putting our hand back into the bag over and over and over again do not get me wrong i am not on or utz i love them both however they are much higher in calorie than the popchips br br do a favor and give them a try you truely cannot go wrong even my friends family who do not have to watch their calorie intake enjoy them as well so that is saying something br br hope to read other reviews of happy calorie counting br br keep on munching the healthy way with popchips snacks ,omg the best snack ever , good for you
found these while looking for good cheap low calorie snack packs to buy in bulk for my office after my first shipment i decided to have two boxes shipped to the office monthly via subscribe save my next shipment arrives in two days i am so excited br br gotta have my pop chips ,great price great taste , great
my husband and i both really like the popchips they are a great substitute for regular potato chips and we both find them very satisfying ,yum , great chips

i am trying to eat healthy and could not really find any good tasting low fat snacks my friend told me about pop chips that she bought from amazon she said she loved them and i should give them a try i said what the heck if she likes them they must be good and what do you know i loved them and i have a bag almost everyday for a snack ,them , great taste
the only complaint i have with pop chips is that i cannot get all of the flavors at the stores where i live my husband and i both love pop chips his favorite is the salt and pepper and mine is the sour cream and onion pop chips are a perfect mix between a chip and a rice cake we cannot say enough good things about them ,pop chips are the best , great chips
i love popchips they have a great crunch without the greasy feel and taste they are very similar to munchos very light and fluffy if you are looking for something to satisfy your salty craving these are a great way without having to feel so guilty about consuming an amount of calories ,great and unique chips , great taste
the original flavor would work fine with any dip and are okay on their own br the salt and pepper flavor is awesome really tasty and a great snack for only calories br the sour cream and onion is a little y but decent br the barbeque is good but not tasty enough the flavor does not go as well with the texture br br t yet tried the other two flavors will update as i do br br if you have not tried popchips they are sort of a cross between pringles and rice cakes less like styrofoam than rice cakes and made with the same potato flakes kind of texture as pringles without as much fat br br so far i have this on subscribe and save and will keep that subscription active these definitely beat a calorie bag of potato chips as a snack ,some are really tasty others a little tasting , the best chips i have ever had
i bought these when they were on a gold box deal thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunches and then i would never buy them again br br not so br br they re actually really tasty exceptionally crunchy and the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips definitely going on subscribe and save for a while br br i do not think they are any more salty than standard potato chips but they are by no means low salt ,tasty , great chips

i agree with reviewers who enjoy this alternative to the regular salty snack options the texture of the chips is great and they are very flavorful i can certainly taste the sodium but if this is not a problem for you i would recommend trying them it is a snack i look forward to having a chance to enjoy everyone has their favorite flavor i m no exception bbq so i recommend trying the variety pack first i thought i would have at least one or two flavors we would hate but no br br my initial purchase of an alternative snack was chips in parmesan garlic herb nothing against them but they lacked the flavor punch i was looking for these popchips are exactly right br br i can definitely recommend these chips for anyone who likes a salty flavorful snack ,different and yummy , great chips
i loved these chips they were exactly what i had been looking for they are not fried greasy or baked dry they were great tasting satisfying and healthy alternative to regular potato chips you can feel good about eating these chips cannot say enough you will have to try them for yourself i am ordering more now ,loved these chips , great chips
although i can not say that these are the same thing as potato chips they are a good alternative and very tasty the flavors are much like the potato chips you would get at the store it is the texture that is different they are less oil a good thing and lighter than potato chips almost like a rice cake except much thinner and all of the flavors are good except for the cheese one i did not care for it although my two year old likes it br br all in all for the calories you cannot beat it and for long term weight maintenance and health these are great and delicious as well amazon com out a very fresh product that is as good as if you bought it from the shelf of your local grocery store ,great alternative to regular potato chips , great chips
the chips are very good and serve as a great snack with very low calories and weight watcher point value ,pop chips , great chips
are a bit bolder than you would expect from a chip for me this was a good thing i would have to say the bbq is my favorite the flavor reminded me a lot of lays but a bolder version of it the sweet flavor with a bold kick at the end my bags had very few broken chips in them everything about this order was great br br my father was around when i was trying my first bag making fun of them cause they were healthy i offered him one and he probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and effect he looked at me confused once he ate it promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it this is a man who hates anything healthy but shows how good the flavors are br br i will definitely be buying these again ,yum , not bad but not as good as i like
i picked up a oz bag of the salt and vinegar chips last weekend at wegman and in a blink of an eye the bag was gone very nice vinegar flavor bad side was in a blink of an eye they were gone which is not good for portion control i ordered the variety pack in oz size single serving to help with portion control most of the flavors i like but fair warning the parmesan garlic is very garlic love the salt and pepper with calories a pack what a nice change from baked chips try it you will like it ,awesome chips , great chips
expect something equally awesome that stands on its own popchips do not leave any funny residue in your mouth like some other diet chips and they do not have a lot of fat and calories only cal per single serve bag i got the variety pack and liked every one of the six flavors some better than others because i am not a big fan of cheddar chips by any maker so these were as good as any but all were good most were great even non dieters who tried them liked them it seems like they cost a bit more than the average bag of chips but maybe that is because i had to buy a case even so they are worth it if you are fighting the battle of the and want a lo cal indulgence you would not otherwise be able to enjoy my recommendation eat popchips ,popchips , good flavor
great for portion control it is probably all we need and popchips knows it definitely more filling than other calorie snacks made by say or the oreos mini muffins type br flavor the pack comes with cheddar potato sea salt and vinegar and barbecue potato as an english major i am inclined to take the potato off the label just as salty and flavorful as normal chips but not overpowering like some cheap tortilla chips some doritos natural taste br i bought these on sale with a discount i believe i might purchase them again if i won a gift card or something but i would rather look for these in a store or at a warehouse club and save some trees on the box they come in but if you are on the fence and worried about being disappointed you will not be this is definitely quality over quantity ,pop not baked or , good for you
i ordered these chips due to other reviews being so good in addition my pregnant wife and i enjoy foods that are and easy for taking on the go but the main reason i ordered these chips was that they are a health conscious choice and the flavor does not disappoint they are excellent br br here is a nutritional breakdown br br calories br calories from fat br total fat g br saturated fat trans fat and mono g br cholesterol mg br sodium mg br potassium mg br total carbohydrates g br dietary fiber g br sugars g br protein g br calcium br iron ,delicious even for those who dont enjoy healthy food , great product
i hate to type this because there are so many people that really enjoy this product but take a look at the ingredients in this so called all natural product i have the cheddar cheese flavor right in front of me so that is the only flavor i can vouch for right now about halfway down the list of ingredients you will see yeast extract unfortunately this is the new msg many people are still of this fact and natural food companies are taking advantage it is a chemical flavor enhancer whose potential side effects are very scary google msg yeast extract for yourself or check out ,beware ingredients , not as good as it is

these are to potato chips as pringles are to chips as instant coffee is to brewed coffee and stephen is to same family but so i would buy a single small package at your grocers and try them out not for everyone and certainly not for my family which includes two teenage boys even they take a pass on these unless they are truly desperate crispness is ok even mouth feel is good but there is a lingering not good taste again kind of like pringles ps the flavors are ok but definitely taste like they were made at that flavor factory along the jersey ,instant coffee and , great chips
purchased the oz bag seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased but did not realize it was ounces as compared to other bags just be aware might be perfect for some but not for us having a bag with potato chips in it does not cut it for me might be perfect for kids but just a heads up ,barely any chips in the bag , not as good as it is

these are by far one of the most tasty chips available in the market it is not greasy does not leave a strong after taste as compared to other chips available in the market first time time tasting it was during the natural product west in fell in love with it almost right away br br the only thing i can complain about this product was probably the price which is higher compared to chips of other brands in addition the barbeque flavor and the original flavor are slightly salty compare to the rest of the flavor in the variety pack br br amazon on this item along with the subscription discount made me pull the trigger almost if you have a costco nearby you can also purchase this item at a very discounted price slightly higher than what amazon offers though ,can i just say yum , great chips

the bbq salt vinegar and cheddar are really good alone and i am not normally a bbq chip person i tend to eat the original sour cream onion and the salt pepper with laughing cow cheese as a dip i do not really care for the salt pepper as much as the others because i do not really like pepper in general and these are very peppery i wish they would replace the salt pepper with the parmesan garlic flavor br br also i like to buy these small packages to limit my portion size but also because there are a lot of chips in this one little bag it also makes it really convenient for me to grab a few bags and take them to work or throw a few in the car i do not have kids but the small bags would be nice for kids as well ,delicious and the right amount , great product

the reason why i ordered this on line is because the only pop chips they have in my store are the regular and salt and vinegar barbeque i love the sour cream and onion ones actually i love all of them but it is great to have them in the calorie bag because if they were not i would not be able to stop eating them ,i love pop chips , great chips

i love these chips so much and i cannot get over how delicious each variety is the price here is awesome too ,absolutely delicious , great chips
heb and couldnt help but consume half of a bag in a day the entire stock didnt last even a week for me br br many chips say they have a bold flavor but they never deliver these however do i tried the garlic chips and the first things i thought was how strong and delicious the was shortly followed by a garlic flavor combined with a sharp crunch i cannot have enough of these chips i am almost afraid to buy a pack because i know they will not last a month br br it also helps that these things are pretty healthy for you i mean they are a potato crisp so you cannot be entirely guilt free but i do not knock myself for going to town i just avoid the potato chip aisle these are on when i need to lay low on the snack foods ,healthier better tasting option , not as good as i like the
these chips are incredible enough cannot be said about them they are better than potato chips and without the guilt of fat and calories ,for little calories , great chips
i love these chips they always make a great healthy snack when i am stuck at work with just the vending machine for ,healthy yum , great chips
love these pop chips the variety bag was a great deal especially with the off tasty low fat just what i needed as a healthy alternative for a great price i highly recommend these ,excellent , great chips
do not have all of the fat that regular chips contain i was introduced to the wonderful world of popchips several months ago and i have not looked at regular chips the same i do not consume amounts of potato chips however i do occasionally pack my kids lunch with the salty my family enjoys the popchips so much that i purchased a variety pack of oz bags from amazon they taste very good and the texture is wonderful although i will admit they are a bit salty i really enjoy the salt and pepper flavor the best with the salt and vinegar coming in a close second make sure you have a large glass of water as you are consuming these popped treats because as i stated before they are quite salty i highly recommend these for individuals who eat potato chips and want a somewhat more healthy alternative ,popchips the perfect snack to pop in your mouth , great for you
love all the flavors just the right size package and taste great give them a try you will love them also ,love them , great taste
i discovered pop chips a year or so ago and my whole family loves them we are partial to crunchy salty snacks like potato chips but hardly ever get them because of the calorie these are a perfect substitute great to tide you over between meals or with a sandwich or a movie watching snack the small size bags are perfect for not getting too carried away too ,crunch without guilt , great chips
i love popchips the bag now has only calories and it bit smaller but if you are craving pop chips without the fat and still taste great these are for you a bit pricey but worth it ,great taste now in a calorie bag , great chips
i heard of these through my weight watchers magazine they a had a coupon code so i figured what the heck wow pop chips are amazing every flavor is awesome i particularly liked the salt pepper if you want crunch and flavor these are for you ,love this product , great taste
i do not know why everyone loves these chips they are healthy but taste disgusting only the original flavor tasted good so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea i would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these makes popped chips that are way better ,weird flavors , great chips
i am interested in these but was wondering if someone that has them could post some nutrition info on them mainly fat fiber sugars and then any vitamins thanks so much ,can some of the nutrition , not as good as it
i shared these with my two older sons then ordered more these are great to put in the compartment for after work ,these are a great snack , great taste
i decided to try these based on the reviews they are pretty good especially for a more healthy option but not sure i will get them again ,pretty good but will not buy again , not as good as
for these but remember you have oz extra in the kettle nutrition info just about a wash br br and then topping it all the cost an oz vs for baked kettles in subscription wow these wonderful snacks cost per pound packed as they are the prices will but think about the things you can buy for that money instead these are bags that does not help the environment either portion control aside with product largely its kick from sodium and cheap spices br br the most positive thing i can say is the product is packed very well lots of air in the bags to protect the chips and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags you will not have many crumbs in the of these little bags so that is a good thing br br but bottom line expensive junk health food wow ,not impressed , a great product
two words potato flakes not sure what the buzz about these is try one bag before you buy a case cannot be returned ,disgusting , great taste
in my book you can eat one serving with ease and not feel any just wish that there were more bbq and cheese flavored selections the black pepper is the yet ,pop chips are , good but not great
ok but would never buy them again my husband ate some br br i thought they tasted a lot like the chips they used to call br br just not for me ,i did not like the taste , not as good as it is
i have heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips i could not eat them though they just do not taste good to me personally my grandmother loved them though and i gave the rest to her ,did not like the taste , great chips
they taste awesome esp the salt n pepper one i love them and they are really healthy the packaging is really good ,amazing , good chips
these popchips are a great alternative when you need a snack they are much lower in calories fat than regular chips and are controlled i especially like the barbeque flavor or the salt and pepper flavored popchips ,popchips , great chips
we love popchips but they are hard to find at our local grocery stores i was very excited to find this variety pack which has flavors some of which we would never tried before in single serve packages right around calories a piece our favorites were the original sea salt vinegar and sour cream onion but all of the flavors were good these were perfect for snacks but they also made for easy lunches we will definitely order again ,fantastic mix of goodness , great taste
popchips are an excellent snack i really like all of the varieties i use amazon subscription plan and save some i get pack box per month shipped automatically life is grand ,popchips flavor variety pack , great chips
popchips are phenomenal unfortunately just not readily available at a retailer near you ordering online is the next best especially with amazon prime service my dad loved his boxes of popchips i am happy as his daughter to find a healthier snack that he can enjoy and receive right at his doorstep ,popchips , delicious
i am enjoying the recent purchase of popchips so far i have enjoyed all the flavor choices the individual serving bags make it easy for me to have just the right portion serving with my meals or if i have a craving for a snack thanks for the product jean ,yummy popchips , great taste
i am really glad amazon carries these they are so much better for you than regular chips and actually taste good too we have not found a flavor we did not like yet i will probably use the amazon subscribe feature to get another off as we will go through these fairly regularly awesome chips ,yum we love pop chips , great chips
these are the best chips i have every tasted they are healthy for you have great flavor i will buy often i eat bag a day with my lunch yummy ,pop chips , great chips
this chips are perfect for a snack without having greasy fingers leftover all the flavors are great with my favorite being the vinegar and sea salt ,great chip , great chips
great chips no after taste br seem to be much better for me br need to buy the big bags now ,great chips love the salt vinegar , great chips
these a try since one of my good friends and her son raved about how good they were bad idea i almost ordered two since they were such a good price i am so glad i didn t we do not care of these at all the concept is nice chips that are crunchy and better for you than most but they taste funny they have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable we have been slowly and i mean very slowly making our way through the the box brought we still have left and we received them over two weeks ago so they are not so horrible that you cannot eat them its just like us to eat them so we do not have to throw them all away if you have not had them before i suggest trying them before committing to bags of various yucky flavors ,we really did not like these , good but not great
not anything to rave about they were okay i think if i truly had a craving for chips i would just buy and eat regular ones will not buy again ,they are okay , not as good as it is
amazing concept not fried not even baked popped like popcorn br this is another product for my weight watchers each bag is only points i love this snack for mid morning in between breakfast and lunch they taste really good my favorite are the bar b que salt vinegar and the sour cream they are all good though ,excellent thumbs up , great popcorn
although they are mildly healthier they do not taste as good as baked lays br br also having a huge box of chips around is not necessarily healthy because i ended up eating them more often br br they are worth a try but they just seem a bit overpriced even with subscription savings and over ,nothing special baked taste better , not as good as you are
grams per bag of the sour cream flavor so do not get them expecting them to be low fat br tastes like a low fat chip but with all the fat of regular chips br br conclusion br i m on if i will order them again i have a finicky stomach and so i am fine with things that taste low fat and healthy since those are mostly what i eat but these have all the fat and calories of chips that are fried and even more than those that are baked so i am on if i want more chips that have a healthy taste with all the fat the all natural ingredients are what make this chip different and what might bring me back for more it is definitely one of those snacks you have to try for yourself and see if you like them or not ,and a rice cake the is they are all natural , not bad but not great
made in heaven not so much the flavors were too strong most of the time i am a huge fan of pepper but even i had a hard time enjoying the salt pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is and this is from someone who currently lives in the uk and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here and too in others the only flavors that my husband and i both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we did not enjoy them enough to want to buy these again br br i wish these were as good as all the regarding them said but we still have bags of these in our cabinet four months later so needless to say i will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on ,too strong of flavors , not as good as i like
i expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips in reality i get an okay taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors and salt pepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips i have ever had if you are just looking for a great tasting brand of chips with health as a on the list there are much much better brands out there in the end i compare these chips to diet soda vs regular some will not tell the difference while some will immediately sense it and hate it ,if you are full chip flavor getting another brand of chips , not as good as i be
i ordered these chips because they got so many good reviews and i am so glad i did br all of the flavors are tasty and satisfying at calories a bag they are a great snack they that hunger for crunchy salty goodness without killing my diet yes they are a bit pricier than a big bag of regular chips but it stops me from eating just a couple more and bag is really enough to keep me happy i have got a new favorite chip ,great for weight , great chips
to eat healthy like me but love junk food like me these are the chips for you i have given up potato chips and french fries in my quest to eat guilt free but a sandwich just needs something on the side these chips add a great crunch as a side to a sandwich and are a great snack for only calories they have no preservatives no artificial flavors or colors no cholesterol grams saturated fat o grams trans fat and are gluten free ingredients are potato flakes potato starch safflower oil and or sunflower oil rice flour sea salt they would be great to pack in a school lunch or for an after school snack i ordered them on the subscription plan a case a month but might have to add an extra shipment everyone i have given a pack to loved them too and came back for more ,good chips and not bad for you , good for you
popchips are good and great for diet snack but on amazon the price is nearly double the cost of costco an pack is only at costco ,over priced cheaper at , great chips
so for a healthier snack it sure is salty but then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories each bag is calories with sodium intake for the day br br the chips are not bad i just would not get them again because most of the flavoring comes from the salt ,tasty but salty , good chips but not as good as you are
nor baked br br however even though it is advertised as being healthy but still with plenty of flavor that flavor just means each chip is loaded with salt i only looked at the nutrition facts after i felt they were too salty and i discover that a cal bag contains of sodium br br i m not a health nut nor am i trying to diet these were my first food purchase from amazon and i bought them because they were at the top of the search list and seemed to be a best seller however i just could not get into these chips br br i realize that the flavour of the chips is up to each individuals tastebuds and so i will say that these are perfect for those who enjoy chips with strong flavor i personally enjoy chips where i can taste some potato as well ,not as good as i was to believe , great chips
i happened upon this item in my local deli and being i decided to try they were fabulous better than the regular chips by far i gives you satisfaction of crunch and flavor in a potatoe chip great great find ,great crunch solution , great chips
the vending machine at work and they only have chips that are bad for you these chips are crisp delicious and taste salty mmmmmmm good each bag has mg of sodium they only have calories in a bag and the amount of chips in the bag is ample for one serving unlike other calorie snacks where you get almonds or crackers now i can have chips every day at work for lunch no guilt the salt and pepper variety is absolutely delicious the plain is great for dipping and the barbecue is full of flavor the salt and vinegar is very sour if you like that type and the cheddar and sour cream and onion varieties are good just not my favorites a very good deal on subscribe and save chips delivered to your door individually bagged and ready to take for lunch convenient nothing bad to say about popchips ,pop chips yum , great chips
the chips are good with fast service but i ordered a case of popchips flavor variety pack and received bags all barbecue flavored ,good but did not what was ordered , great chips
importantly they taste better br br i for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that baked lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit br br at the end of the day make a decision for yourself but i would strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both baked lays and popchips i can almost guarantee you that baked lays will win hands down br br hopefully amazon starts selling well priced variety single serve bags of baked lays soon for now i found one from a seller but the price seems a little high but there are bags instead of a href http www amazon com gp product b smart mix variety pack count baked lay classic baked cheetos baked ruffles baked doritos nachos cheese gold tiny twists pack of a ,popchips baked baked taste much better , good flavor
i have not ordered yet my question is from the description it is bags at ounces how does this equal ounces in total weight ,weight , good
i first tried the bbq flavor at a restaurant which was good then i was carried away with the fat part which made me pay without realizing my mistake br br the salt pepper is ok only ok after trying another one i changed my mind br br the bbq is good but not that good br br the rest is pure trash i did not like them what so ever nor my other friends br br the price is high and not worth it for a small single serving as others such as utz is better and cheaper br br starts is too much for this over marketed less of flavor and over priced snack br br avoid br br stars off bad flavors br br star off pricy as and not worth it ,not worth the order is cheap , not as good as it is
i have tried using a toaster microwave confection oven stove to make these things myself but i was not able to i even tried but was unable to get the chips to pop i verified my methods with a local grocery store named mat his name has one t which seemed a little strange to me but to no avail br br i contacted customer support asking for instructions but they and confused about their own product i do not know why they could not just mail or at least email me some popping instructions br br luckily i think even raw unpopped they taste pretty good people look at them funny at first but after they try a few they basically devour the whole bag completely unpopped ,did not work for me , not as good as i be
the flavors are kind of funky salt and pepper tastes like someone just a jar of black pepper over the chips and the salt and vinegar two varieties just make one go tossed out those but the others were very good less chip and more like a cracker with a chip flavor still a good item but i would not suggest the variety pack unless you living dangerous and have lots of water to gag them down with ,good chips but , not as good as i be
the sun chips are an ok substitute for the usual potato corn whatever chip cooked in oil and over salted they are not nearly as un palatable as i thought they would be have added them to my heart healthy diet all are good except for the multi grain style which has the texture of a sheet of ,healthy chips , great chips
i bought those chips after reading good reviews but i was very disappointed with the taste it was nothing like what i expected granted that i expected good old kettle cooked potato chips i bought the flavor variety pack and there were many flavors i did not care for it was worth trying them but i am not going to purchase them again in the future ,not so great , not as good as it is
pop chips are basically a horribly over priced version of munchos which are baked potato chips and have been around forever period ,they have been around forever but you did not know it , great chips
i bought these chips thinking that they are all natural per their description of no preservatives no artificial flavors or colors when i received them i checked the ingredients and they contain yeast extract which is with msg yeast extract contains processed free acid i will never purchase this product again ,of msg in the ingredients , great chips
the best flavor in this box is the salt and pepper and the bbq flavor all the other flavor was just so so ,get the salt and pepper box instead , great taste
i was at a charity raising event where they were handing these out they seemed pretty tasty so i bought a couple bags at target the ones i bought barbeque and salt and vinegar were awful i ended up throwing away most of them neither i nor anyone else who tried them could choke them down the ones they were handing out as samples were clearly very different from what they are selling do not waste your money ,awful , not as good as you are
these chips taste average and they are insanely expensive compare to the big bags of chips from safeway or costco for you can get a big bag with times the amount of chips compare to these oz bag chips so for in safeway you can get worth of popchips these bags are so tiny it is like serve size for fat people trying to lose weigh or something for me i never gain weigh i rather go buy big bag of chips these are expensive chips will never buy again br maybe i think the price is high because i bought it from amazon com maybe elsewhere is cheaper but chips as junk food should not be that expensive compare to local stores ,taste average expensive , great chips
i am not as about these as everyone else but for a low calorie snack they are fine they certainly do not do much to curb the appetite though i am typically just as hungry after finishing as before not like with protein chips also available through amazon ,low calorie snack , great snack
the texture is like rice crackers which i personally do not like taste is not too bad but every single bags are too salty even the original flavor i would give four stars if they make low sodium chips the salt is one of your worst i bet it does more to your body than msg ,not my of potato chips , not as good as it is
these chips are too salty br i like the crunch size of the bags and variety br but i cannot finish the case due to how salty these chips are ,too salty , great chips
the cheddar tastes a little weird but that could be personal preference the salt and vinegar is very strong but tastes okay other than that salt and pepper is yum barbeque is good too plain is plain if you are a die hard potato chip lover and do not care about calories do not bother with these however if you want your salty snacks and do not want all the calories these work i would buy them again ,the salty snack , not as good as i like
i have been on weight watcher for about months i have lost pounds the most important part to being on weight watchers is too find food items that let you feel like your not giving anything up popchips do that for me they are only points plus on weight watcher they go great with every meal salad soup sandwich etc i can not live without them so i say buy buy buy and buy ,on weight , good for you
love these i am not a fan of potato chips but these taste fresh and not at all greasy a little like pringles but much tastier ,so good , great chips
i am so happy to have discovered these chips i hate a phrase from another product but they melt in your mouth i have ordered and tried all flavors without disappointment just getting ready to place another order for these calorie per bag air popped chips do try them people ,in your mouth , great chips
this seemed like the perfect way to limit my addiction to potato chips small single serving bags i really like the plain unflavored popchips but the rest of the flavors had an aftertaste i plan to set up subscribe save for just the plain ,i only like the plain ones , great taste
love the chips nice calorie snack reminds me of munchos but less greasy flavors are good salt vinegar least favorite and they have started shipping thank you and my family thanks you so they do not have to get the package and made my day ,to , great taste
time the sea salt and pepper potato and the sea salt and vinegar potato are a bit strong at first and if you do not like those flavors i would say you would not like those chips but they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients original potato and sour cream and onion potato are also tasty but nothing to necessarily rave about for me at least i would not call this a diet chip but a healthy alternative to over processed chips i saw a few complaints about the popchips being too salty or high in sodium the chips can come across salty to a person who does not consume much salt but per bag these popchips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt overall great buy you just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you and for me it is ,tasty crunchy and , good but not great
wow these are remarkably tasty chips i discovered them through weight watchers and like the fact that they are low in calories and fat br but they are high in flavor and br i am now a big fan ,yum , great chips
these are great because they are only calories per pack and are just as good if not better than other chips out there br br the original style taste exactly like munchos but do not come with the high calorie count the other flavors sour cream onion salt vinegar salt pepper cheddar and bbq are all delicious as well ,low in calories high in taste , not as good as you are
i had seen these advertised on the hungry girl website but was not big on buying an expensive potato chip i was given a free bag at some event found them to be tasty the single serve bags in the grocery store were for a oz bag buy them from here and they are for oz bags same amount of weight watchers points if you get two cases shipping is free get them now before the states force the sales tax thing through br br all of the flavors are really good i even liked the bbq which i normally do not like in a chip the cheddar have a good cheese taste and the salt n pepper have a kick they do not leave a funny aftertaste or strange mouth coating like some of the other lower fat calorie chips ,buy them less from here you can , the best chips i have ever had
love these chips they are perfectly seasoned and of course have no grease at all there is also not the cardboard taste of a baked chipped the popped texture of the potatoes is nice and light they are only calories a bag but there are lots of chips in the bag so it is a great snack the ingredient list is also pretty wholesome without any strange chemicals added fav flavor is probably salt and pepper or bbq ,delicious , great chips
the traditional fried chips i have ever had and at half the fat and calories how could you ask for anything more br br the variety pack comes in flavors original sour cream and onion salt and pepper cheddar salt and vinegar and bbq my favorite flavors are salt and pepper and cheddar my least favorite is salt and vinegar but i do not like any salt and vinegar flavored chip my only wish is that this variety pack contained the parmesan garlic flavor which is very good but extremely hard to find in local stores i have ordered the parmesan garlic flavor in a pack here on amazon but prefer the assortment that comes in the variety pack br br at after the subscribe and save discount each bag costs only cents this is a bargain for these great tasting healthy chips and i highly recommend you try them ,my new favorite chips , the best chips i have ever had
probably close in preference to the bbq br original potato good but a little salty seems to somewhat between bags br salt pepper good everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more br parmesan garlic good but overall was you definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter br sour cream onion not so good no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag br br i know taste is a very subjective thing but i hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try i did get them at a reduced price through subscribe save and shortly after my first order amazon had them on the gold box for an even better price i think the average price per bag came out to approximately six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account ,this picky eater loves them most flavors , not as good as i like
these are the greatest potato snack products i have found only points for weight watchers really crispy and tasty all of the flavors are great my only complaint it difficult to open the little bags i need a pair of scissors but i guess that keeps them fresher for longer so it is a great trade off i would recommend these chips to everyone ,pop chips rock , great snack
i really like these chips they have a different texture than regular potato chips but i still find it really tasty even my boyfriend who is often to all things healthy and low fat will gobble these up rather quickly the variety packs are great because they allow you to have a little bit of everything but of course the downside is that you may not like some flavors as much i find the original version to be a little bland by itself and the sea salt and vinegar flavor might be too strong for some people ,great snack , great chips
are crisp and crunchy not puffy they have a distinct potato taste br br the best part each bag in at only calories and i repeat these are not a simple calorie snack what you get here is a full bag of chips what is great about the content vs calorie content is that these are perfect to your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a calorie bag of chips br br my personal favorites were the sea salt and vinegar and the original the barbecue flavor is sweet not smoky the salt and pepper cheddar and sour cream and onion flavors are standard fair but the chips are and evenly seasoned and i did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next br br these are a great product well manufactured and a treat to eat i will definitely buy more of these in the future ,tasty potato chips low in calories great flavor , delicious and delicious and
wow these chips are delicious br br they re low in calorie and carb count i can actually have a salty snack without feeling guilty about it and the taste is better then unhealthy oil grocery store chips br br the sour cream onion salt vinegar and cheddar are my favorites br br if you are weight conscience want something healthy or just want something that tastes good buy these chips you will not be disappointed ,love love love these chips , great chips
this does not taste as addicting as the real fried potato chips but it is still very good br considering it is low in calories and it is only popped it taste much better than the ones that are freeze dried br these pops taste as light as the rice crispy treats but with a good amount of flavor and crunch br i like it a small little pack that you can just grab when you feel like having something quick br i keep then in my room in case if i ever get the cravings for chips br all the flavors that come in are good too no br br the package also arrived fast and it is pretty cheap i would recommend people who is watching calories to get this ,all the taste but where is the fat , great chips
reviews stars and the fact that they were heavily discounted from the regular price first of all oz per bag equals about or chips per bag which is not many while this may be fine for those who are trying to cut back on calories fat or sodium the fact is that of an ounce is not much and that might tempt people to eat more than one bag at a time due to the discounted price each bag was around each not to bad until you figure that equals per pound at the regular price its about per pound as far as the taste all of the flavors were good none that i absolutely disliked but none that really my socks either bottom line at the discounted price i paid i was not disappointed but if i had paid the regular price for these i would have felt cheated ,not bad but not oz about chips , not bad but not bad
i actually purchased these i myself find that they taste just like those like rice crisp with salt and flavoring from the reviews i thought they was more like munchos they are not bbq to salty but if you like a little its ok according to the family plain is horrible salt and vinegar was the best overall my family gave it stars i will stick to kettle chips ,not bad but not great , not bad
we have these delivered they are a great healthy sub for potato chips and the snack bags are a perfect size great crunch and we enjoy all the flavors ,pop chips rock , great chips
these are my favorite chips the bbq and salt pepper are the best br br the texture of these things rock br br all nicely packaged br br gluten free if you care i do not but some have commented on that ,i love these chips , great chips
these chips are tasty and low in calorie if you are gluten free they are a great option as a to go snack we love them ,great snack , great chips

i like to take my lunch to work and this is perfect to give me just enough chips that i can munch on with my lunch i love the flavors and the packaging is perfect worth the buy the price is right the flavors are just what they want portion size is good thus it is a win win situation for me and them ,taste is perfect , great product
overall the chips were very tastey my daughter even liked then so that is a real plus for me some flavors were better but all did meet my expectations try it and see for enjoy ,good snack choice , great chips
this chips are really good and it is fun getting the variety pack now are they as good as regular chips probably not but they are also not nearly as fattening and bad for you as regular chips given that these are a healthier version if you want chips i would highly recommend them ,delicious and healthy chips , great chips
i ordered this case of chips as a deal with some vita coco and it was a stellar deal this size bag is perfect for snacking the assortment of chips is great there is something in there for everyone ,popchips , great chips
love pop chips the assortment package was a great find but would liked to be able to choose the flavor varieties i wanted did not care for the sea salt and vinegar flavor but all the rest were great ,pop chips , great chips
i really like the pop chips but i do not like all the flavors the only ones i like are the originals the rest of these flavors were really not good at least not in my family i gave them away to a senior center and most of the didnt like them sorry but it is a matter of taste and most things should stick to the originals they are the best br br this snack originals fits into my daily ww program for allot less money then snacks made for the programs specifically br br i will continue to buy the originals and leave the others to others ,popchips , good chips but not as good as you are
delicious light and full of flavor it is difficult to decide what my favorite flavor is but bbq is amazing i was impressed with the packaging but i cannot imagine it is too cost efficient or eco friendly that is my only complaint great product and guilt free snacking ,popchips my new favorite snack , delicious
love these popchips they are all great do not care for the salt pepper flavors i wish manufacturer would come up with a variety pack that did not include that flavor as that flavor is just wasted with each purchase i make and i have made alot the bbq original salt vinegar and sour cream onion chips are superb ,great chips , great chips
i love popchips they may take some time getting used to if you are used to the of potato chips but they are only calories per bag buying a pack saves you money per bag but you are sooo tempted to eat them with so many bags around ,low calorie tasty snack , great chips
good texture they are crunchy and not sharp will not cut mouth br br flavor they do not taste like potato chips if i had not just opened the bag i would suspect they were stale but no this is how they taste many others have about the odd flavor as well br br healthy good for dieting i suppose low oil and low salt br br i will not be buying these again ,healthy texture good flavor , not as good as you are
i am very picky when it comes to chips i have gone through so many but this one really hits the spot it has just the right amount of crunch with just the right amount of flavor it is also great to know that you are not eating something that is bad for you with calories a pack it is definitely the ideal snack ,great taste crunchy , great taste
i loved this product and it was better than what i thought it was going to be my favorite was salt and flavor yum yum but i hated the cheddar and salt pepper ones ,yum , great taste
i am not going to lie i will give you the these things are like crack br br i will polish off about pages of these easily in a day hence the that i have gained lol br br if you love these i suggest them out with some kind of carb ,love em so does my big fat belly , good but not great
really really tasty br much healthier than almost every other potato chip br a variety of flavors consider this a huge sampler br br sea salt vinegar is crazy sour personally i think they it on the vinegar br it hard to stop at one serving but i take this as a sign of a good snack p ,new favorite found , great taste
my subscription of popchips arrived on time and not damaged i love the fact that i receive a great variety of chips which are healthier and at the same time very tasty and satisfying the way the chips are packed for shipping is perfect having a subscription is the way to go and of course the price is so right br br thank you ,treat of the day , great chips
these were awesome they have a great crunchy texture and flavor and are very filling i bought the variety pack to try all the flavors did not care for the salt and pepper but loved the rest will definitely buy more ,yummy , good for you
it is so wonderful to eat pop chips i am a loyal fan and will continue tasty and healthy br br the flavors are good too and pleasing to everyone with their various choices ,pop chips great , great chips
what can i say if you have had popchips in the past and love them then no better place to pick them up i love these chips and have bought them without an issue from amazon br br thanks ,if you love them you love them popchips , great chips
i won them off a penny site my year old likes them plenty i do not think there is any potato flavor they taste more like to me but are ok the salt and vinegar is strong holy cow ,not bad , not as good as
these chips arrived in terrible condition the box they were sent in was a display box with all the usual on the box for display why someone would send a box like that in the mail and not have put it in another real box is beyond me the box we received was heavily to keep it together since the box came open on the display and looked like someone had over the box as well which gives you an idea of the shape of the box the chip bags inside were pretty flat there were no chips but plenty of crumbs for any use you would need crumbs for this is how many of the packages looked flat there were a few with edible chips but not many not sure what to think of shipping chips in this type of a box common sense should have been used ,poor poor packaging , the best chips i have ever had
next time i will order only the original flavor the other flavors did not suit me too much of an aftertaste ,good , not as good as
i do love popchips they work well with weight watchers taste great and the crunch cannot be beat this pack has many flavors with the salt and vinegar being my favorite my husband loves the salt and pepper and my kids like original and cheddar br br the one i miss is sweet potato it is by far my favorite of the whole lot of flavors but are not included in this variety pack ,love these good variety pack , great taste
before so i gave it a br br wow the best crunch and flavor of all reduced calorie chips i have ever tried better than other brands popped chips i have tried since i need portion control help and these little bags for points do it for me the variety pack helps to break up any my favorite flavor is the bbq i am not a vinegar kinda guy the salt and vinegar flavor tastes like feet to me love the rest of the flavors i love salt so the saltiness is just right for me thank goodness my blood pressure is not an issue i need these br br lost pounds so far in months eating these will probably buy them by the case in the amazon auto order system to save on shipping i guess i plan on being a life long fan until something better comes along ,popchips does it for me , delicious and delicious
these are such a treat when you are craving that salty crunchy snack and the multi box where you get a variety of flavors is perfect share it with son so they do not get stale but not much chance of that one of my points plus weight watchers snacks that i do not run out of ,snack of the , great snack
the only flavor we could stand was the barbecue which was the reason we purchased them in the first place i had to give the others away i will not be buying this again for lunches although the size packaging was great i just wish the other flavors tasted better plain salt pepper etc were not really kid friendly ,my kids only liked one flavor , not as good as it is
got these at a fraction of the price that they charge at the grocery store this was a great buy thanks amazon ,pop chips yummy , good
these taste alright but they are health food by no means at least regular potato chips are just greasy potato slices this products is made of processed potato by product and is natural by no means the calorie savings is not even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil if eaten in moderation because of the healthy dose of balanced fats in my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits if you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip if you feel these taste better than the above then by all means enjoy but do not be into believing these are healthy at all br overall stars for taste and stars for the marketing that they are ,taste but chips are better , i love these chips
i have subscribed these chips they are so tasty not dry or oily cannot put it down once open a bag and have to have two bags in a row ,love it so tasty , great chips
i love these chips they are so delicious it is so hard to eat just one bag all the flavors allow you to taste them all my favorite flavor is the cheese ones go ahead and try them they are so delicious ,pop delicious , great chips
not there these might have been more palatable but my taste buds kept in on that one aspect also the seasonings were not consistently strong cheddar was o k bbq was probably the closest match to regular potato chips the flavor was straight from a bag of lays however i was very disappointed with the sour cream and onion which was just too light in flavor and the vinegar and salt which did not have as strong a tang as i would have liked br br overall i would recommend these to someone who wanted to eat healthy and did not mind a watered down version of a fried chip however i just could not stomach them i gave away the unopened bags to coworkers none of which were impressed either but they are not on diets lucky dogs for now i will stick with my baked and bunny crackers ,like slightly popcorn , not as good as i like the
these chips are great delicious and are healthier than your regular deli store chips i have first purchased these from a supermarket and found them delicious i found amazon to have them cheaper and ordered from them as they had more variety of flavor all the flavors were to my liking the only con about this is that they are addicting you are warned i purchased these through amazon ,delicious , great chips
these are the best chips ever i will buy them again wish more stores had them the plain chips are my fav ,very good , great chips
disagree on what tastes good so he likes the flavors i do not like and it works out great for us and probably will work out great for family situations and parties where people usually do not have the tastes however if you plan on consuming these bags on your own over time i can almost guarantee that there will be a couple flavors that you will not like and it might just be worth it if you just buy a couple bags of flavors you do like br br if you are not accustomed to the taste of healthy food you might not enjoy these at first either way pop chips are worth a try probably not by the case though i recommend trying out a few flavors if you can find a small bag at the shop or vending machine before you buy a big box of them ,not for everyone but i love it , not bad but not bad
i bought these to try them out and for the most part it was a success there are different flavors of chips of them were really good the last one though was not the salt and vinegar ones were very vinegary and it was too bitter for our tastes maybe some people like it but not us all in all though they were mostly very good in both taste and caloric content br i would definitely buy a box with the flavors that i wanted ,most flavors are very good , good chips but not as good as you are
them so i will not be ordering this mixed case again salt and pepper just tasted like pepper making this a very hot tasting chip the and vinegar is really strong on the vinegar which is a taste i do not enjoy i love bbq flavored chips but again this was kind of strong i probably would not purchase the bbq ones in the future but would not say no if someone offered them to me the original is really bland compared to these others but not bad br br the ones i liked the most were the sour cream onion and the cheddar both with milder flavors br br i d give this stars if i liked all of the flavors definitely high marks for the type of chip and the size of the serving and the fact that you can try all of the flavors in one order ,great idea , a great product
yes people these things are healthier than the average chip and not only have flavor but they taste good i am not a big health food person i will take the grease if it makes it taste better these are x better than those baked chips my brother tried them while he was visiting and liked them so much it was one of the things he asked i mail him while only draw back to these chips they are definitely not for dipping ,healthy and good what , great chips
tried the bbq popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which were not that great good healthy snack without giving up the taste so glad i discovered these salt and vinegar are my favorite cal bag g fat bag ,healthy and delicious , great taste
the chips were delicious i did not care much for the vinegar flavored chip but the other flavors were great did not have any guilt eating this healthier snack ,pop chips flavor variety , great chips
i eat a bag of these every single day they are the best tasting good for you snack everyone should at least try them and you will be hooked ,the best snack food , delicious
snacks i mean who would not like them you cannot go wrong with the original but decided to give this one a try i am not a fan of hot foods but i do like things with with a kick and since this had jalapeno in it i was assuming it was hot not so much if you eat mildly hot foods this should not bother you at all and definitely not if you like hot kind of food i did not even find them hot just have a unique kick of jalapeno flavor i would recommend to buy these at your local store if they carry them because this price on here is just insane i buy mine for a little over dollars for this bag overall i hope they decide to keep this one cause they are amazing and yes girls like these kind of snacks too love ,good , good for you
for you spicy lovers these jalape ntilde o cheetos are for you the taste is great and i admit i did not expect them to be this good one day i picked up a small bag at the corner store and by the end of the week i had about empty bags in my trash cans office snack a must unfortunately this product is too good to last and i fear it will meet the same as wasabi rarely does a spicy type of chip that actually tastes awesome become part of the standard sale so enjoy these awesome jalape ntilde o cheetos for as long as they last ,too good to for long , good but not great
these are quite tasty and delicious i love them but the prices here are ridiculous did i say ridiculous oh so ridiculous but im here to rate the product not the price stars for the product ,delicious , delicious
a little costly but they are good and fresh too not stale at all would recomend to any cheetos fan ,the best out there , good but not great
ever even after searching through reviews after reviews finally my boyfriend found the solution basically you will need to open it from the bottom you will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it you will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while there is water in the pot if any one who is reading this still having problem opening it let me know i will try to explain it better there but anyway this is a pretty useless product for its but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own and wants a fridge you can make you own with a cup or any container filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb so unless you have money to waste do not buy this useless pot ,found the solution on how to open it , i love this stuff
this product works great for me i hate spending money on herbs just to use a little and have the rest go bad shortly after i put some herbs mostly basil in here and they were fresh for a few weeks no leakage either the bottom is clearly labeled to twist to lock and the plug stays flush br this thing has already paid for itself in money saved and looks pretty cool in my fridge and on the counter when i am ready to cook ,works for me and me , great taste
i have had my herb savor for a few weeks now and i was waiting to write a review until my herbs went bad so i could tell you how long it takes but it never happened for the first time ever i used all of the herbs before they went bad i have not had any problems with leaking everything closes up nice and tight on mine plus this thing just looks really cool ,this thing is great , great product
i bought this as a gift for my mother she likes it but says it is hard to open when she it i remember having to help her figure out how to open it it took me a minute if you have arthritis you will not be able to this open ,a little hard to open , great product
i have had the herb pods for about months they are a great concept but have a poor design the plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on i am constantly afraid that i am going to break it the pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water unfortunately i do not use them half of the time i buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth ,great poor product , great product
i with my thumb and over the clear plastic about one third from it is bottom and squeeze the sides the bottom lip pops out nicely br i will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley basil ect the company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly br all in all i like it i took away one star for the lack of instructions br br after a few months i have thrown this thing away it became harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs i use most i have seen some newer larger units that do not have the issue with opening it like this one has i m going to order one of these br br i no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to stars ,too small too hard to open , not as good as i be
despite reading the reviews of others on how hard this was to open i was confident i knew the secret so would be fine not so no matter what i did could not pop off the clear plastic lid instructions showed the bottom part off didn t husband could not even do it and he opens everything for me he finally got it open only held about half of the which is what i wanted it for so tossed it in the garbage and then bought one from progresso that we both can open note to self pay more attention to what people are saying ,cannot open , not as good as it is
the reviews on this are so true great idea but such a pain to pop the clear lid off from the side even once i figured it out i keep waiting for it to break in my hands because it does take some pressure to pop off the lid but it feels fragile and likely to break with too much pressure i would consider buying one of the new that seem and open from the top not the side ,great idea a to open and close , great product
i have had trouble storing fresh basil because i learned a long time ago not to put it in the fridge my cat is attracted to anything in the plant family with results this keeps my basil fresh and the cat it ,keeps on the cat , cat cat food
to save even one person from wasting their money like i did the little green plug barely stays in even after it so the water is always out and the clear plastic cover is absolutely the worst design it is nearly impossible to remove and actually into shards when i tried to open one of the pods and i can attest that those plastic shards are sharp if you are able to actually open the pod be prepared for the water to splash out from the bottom even if the pods actually worked well and preserved the herbs which they do not really do they would not be worth the or cost like another reviewer said just put your herbs in a cup with a little water in the bottom and a plastic bag covering the top works perfectly and costs nothing please do not waste your money on this ,save your money , not as good as i like
small bunch and it is difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it it works great for asparagus but only for small ish and if the are not too tall br br more often than not i simply use a canning jar of water with a plastic bag over the top which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access these pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bag topped jar however and the clear front makes it harder to forget what is in there br br they are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or over and the little drain port is fun to use br br but it only works for small ,keeps fresh looks nice to use , great product
the main problem is the container is difficult to open it does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get go br br the thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it you do not need to open the bottom just squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out firmly do not worry you will not break it it is pretty sturdy plastic br br the real issue is when it is filled or has water in it its difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spilling br br i ve just to the water through its fill port then popping it br br prepara please read these reviews and improve on the next design ,would be a great product if it was to open , not bad but not great
even with the tips shared on how to open it it is still pretty difficult to open i guess i have weak hands my husband usually has to open it for me and even he does not do it with ease i would recommend getting the larger prepara herb savor instead of the pod it is much easier to open and can hold more i could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod considering that the grocery sells them in such large and i only use half ,works but hard to open buy version instead of , not as good as it is
right down the middle okay maybe a little harder than lightly i was pretty frustrated luckily i had emptied the water so i only had a small mess to clean up the pod went into the garbage i checked with my friends friend had the same problem and her pod is now a capsule for plant because she had to throw away the clear cover it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it friend has now been warned there were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments i have read we are not the only ones who have had this problem i think this was designed by the same guy that invented the wrapping tape on music i have gone back to my old method a wide mouth mayo jar with pretty hair band a of it works ,sorry not one of my favorite things , not as good as i be
my wife bought me this for storing fresh herbs and despite initial i gave it a try it seemed to work well enough for basil even freshening up some leaves but the seal the deal moment was when i put some fresh thyme in it and put it in the back of my refrigerator where i mostly forgot about it weeks later we were gone for weeks on vacation i opened it and the thyme was as fresh as the day it was cut i doubt it would sustain all greens for this long but the fact that it kept thyme fresh for over a month longer than a plastic bag in the produce drawer would have made this an easy to justify br br it always a nice surprise when a kitchen delivers the goods ,just works , not as good as it is
i bought one of these about or months ago and i love it i have kept a combination of rosemary thyme and parsley they have all kept fresh for more than weeks no brown spots no rotten leaves just perfect br br i highly recommend this product no problems with leaks or the plug not holding ,wonderful this is perfect and me a , great taste
i am a college student who loves to cook and this was given to me about months ago i am so impressed with its ability to keep my herbs fresh for such a long period of time it not only gives more options when i am cooking by having fresh herbs available but also its easy to clean and stores easily in my small fridge i really think this is a must have product for everyone br br and if interested in a larger one i attached a link to the company site prepara where you can see all their cool and innovative products br br ,saver , great product
i have been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb vegetable salad inside to grow vegetables and i thought the prepara herb savor pod looked like the perfect wrong the bottom comes loose and leaks water everywhere similarly the plastic plug at the back does not hold a good idea a nice looking product but poorly from purchasing plastic bags are much much better ,disappointing , not as good as it is
i threw this away after about a week of could not get the clear plastic cover on and off without spilling water all over and half the time i could not get it off at all it only works for long herbs and all need to be about the same height ,this just does not do the , not as good as it is
actually saves my basil and cilantro for an extra week or two thats enough reason for me to buy before my basil and cilantro would last only a couple days and i would have to toss them out this saves me money and a trip to the market ,works great , great product
the prepara herb savor pod is advertised holding asparagus that was why i purchased it thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh in reality the pod will hold very few and they would need to be quite thin and short the ad is misleading i will keep it for storing herbs but asparagus is out of the question ,the picture is misleading , not as good as it is
both and try to cook like chefs in our homes i love this product i use this one for green onions which until recently always went bad before i could use all of them sometimes i threw out more than most times or but i honestly cannot remember the last time i used every single one that is until now inside the savor pod they grow and keep for weeks easily more than i am planning on buying the set of mini savor pods so i can actually use them for fresh herbs storing my herbs in the same container as my onions is not a good idea the only drawback with this product is that the clear plastic cover is a little tricky to remove as others have mentioned but with it is ok with me so long as i can use all my product before it goes bad ,i am buying more , great product
after i the can i noticed it was black in an area at the top of the can and appeared to be of course i was afraid to eat the fruit so i threw it away i am waiting for a response from forest to the type of metal can and if it is harmful one would expect if they went to the effort to be certified as organic they would use safe canning i will post an addendum w their response ,of can , not as good as it is
felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth i eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me only days later my teeth and gums were and i had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad he found infection and i had to a treatment of antibiotics and before i was finally ok again after about weeks needless to say i threw out the remaining cans of fruit the problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were st rate and shining clean quality control must really suck i am all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided this is a product and their health standards may be lacking there i would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health ,not safe , not as good as i be
this product was a complete disappointment tastes like mushy pineapple there was no taste ,tastes like mushy pineapple , great taste
i will never buy this item again i was addicted to it until the last order fruits had foul smell tasted rotten was the expiration dates ,taste and look , not as good as
i was amazed at how good this is for canned fruit which i normally will not touch in particular i adore and mangos the fruit juice instead of syrup is also very nice the easy pull top on the can makes this a great item to stash in my desk drawer at work so that i can have a fruit snack easily even if i was too busy or forgot to bring lunch so far i have not gotten a can that had any problems the watermelon is not crunchy of course not but it is good and certainly not slimy ,great option for fruit at work , great product
this is great chilled and topped with fresh whipped cream it is my husband new favorite dessert br br i do not find the texture off putting of course is is not as crunchy as fresh fruit but the taste is great br br if i can get my husband to eat fruit instead of ice cream it gets an a in my book ,great dessert , great taste
i tried tropical pineapple it was delicious i gave a bad review for tropical fruit salad it had watermelon and pineapple in it i think the two of these were for the flavor i see now thats what i think it was probably not a bad product at all ,fruit , delicious
my yr old granddaughter and i cannot get enough br and it is good for you ,best canned fruit i have ever , great product
this fruit would be fine if it were not for the soft textured watermelon and some other fruit that is in this can that is just and icky there are certain fruit that should not be canned and otherwise the crunchy pieces are fine much of the soft fruit i had to albeit this item is good frozen and added to other fruit to make smoothie then you do not have to taste the ,organic fruit review , not as good as it is
stars instead of three br br first off as you can probably guess by the pictures these are sour gummies that is not said in the description also each one is about to inches in length and inch wide br br texture and flavor the came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings the sourness is average not overwhelming but not too little where i took off the stars was the flavor most important part as i chewed them a few different flavors hit my tongue none of which tasted that great i could not make out any of them in particular not good at that anyways but the combination was just plain strange br br i could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other away to niece after all they will eat anything sugar coated right ,okay but some weird flavors , not as good as i like the
i am a big fan of the dirty martini but i simply cannot eat enough olives to keep up br br love this stuff not quite as tangy as dirty but still very vibrant ,so much , not as good as it is
we have this product many times makes a great dirty martini delivery is prompt product well packed ,makes a quick tasty , great product
this is an excellent product we always ran out of olive juice before we ran out of olives when making dirty martinis now we have a terrific source for great tasting olive juice and our dirty martinis have never been better ,dirty olive juice , great product
the last case a different brand we ordered from amazon was so terrible we threw away the entire case however the brand is very good and we can enjoy a good dirty martini ,a good dirty , not as good as it
what are the white floating in my recently ordered bottles of dirty martini olive juice ,white , the best
if you like bloody mary and dirty this is a must you will not be sorry i am so glad i found this product ,love this , great product
this stuff is it is simply the best olive juice on the market i tried another brand and it did not come close to this stuff is actually better than the olive juice that comes from the jar of olives i would highly recommend this product ,better than the real stuff , the best
i have tried a few different dirty martini mix etc but i prefer the actual juice from the olive jar well as any experienced dirty martini drinker knows you soon have way too many olives and not enough juice family dirty martini olive juice is the real thing i usually buy of the oz bottles and that ll last me several months shipping is pricey but the bottles come not only packed in peanuts but also bubble wrapped they pack em in a sturdy cardboard box and tape it up real well i live in a rural area and usually get my order in about days fantastic experience all the way around ,this is the stuff , not as good as it is
he never has enough juice left over from his jar of olives we therefore end up with more olives then we can eat just buying the juice makes alot of sense ,my husband loves dirty , great product
excellent service price for the product order shipped quickly received in good condition will be ordering again as long as the price stays this good you really cannot beat the price ,dirty olive juice , great coffee
i purchased this item because it was cheaper than other olive juices i was looking for a good quality olive juice for martinis i was pretty disappointed the juice is very strong i followed the instructions and put the ratio on the bottle into the shaker and made a martini the ratio was part vodka to part olive juice it was way too salty the olive juice was over powering i made a decent dirty martini with parts vodka part olive juice i would not recommend this item ,olive juice , great product
the olive juice i purchased was not only inexpensive but has a great flavor i have looked for a long time to buy olive juice for martinis but i could not find anyone that carried it thanks amazon ,great dirty , great product
this product is great if you want a dirty martini i highly recommend this product and it saves you from buying olives and wasting just to get the brine ,dirty , great product
ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically acid read the ingredients the main label says olive juice by no such thing i am going to suggest that amazon take this off the website ,not really olive juice , great taste
this product is simply for cheap liquor since taste and quality is not important i prefer to drink my grey straight however on occasion it is absolutely delicious with a very tiny splash of olive juice this product was a a quick fix for me to stop purchasing olives in order to use the juice it is not worth it the after taste is worse ,it is not worth it , not as good as it is
we use and buy sea salt instead of regular salt like sea salt came as promised in good condition have nothing else to say ,sea salt , great taste
sea salt is more easily with a salt mill this is just a salt shaker that delivers amounts of sea salt and anti agent into your food and no the anti agent is not event that effective so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the stay away ,hard to control the , good but not great
love this balance blend of oils especially in mix such as pancake cornbread cake etc a good oil to ingest ,great cooking oil , great coffee
i used to buy these at world market however they discontinued them br so i am forced to buy them online the rose and flavors are good however i did not like the anise flavor because they were too strong and licorice tasting for me br br i carry these in my purse to freshen my breath and they are really good br also the tin is very cute ,yum , not as good as you are
cannot live without these little jewels not only is there a surprise in the middle but it takes me right to the french while enjoying them ,more than a little mint , not as good as it
a family favorite these are really unique treats the wonderful taste of flowers the and rose are great orange was not to my liking the company that makes them have been around for hundreds of years they are made in a small french town that was featured in a movie called ,absolutely wonderful , great taste
i love these i love any floral flavored product the best part is when people ask for a mint or candy or whatever offer these but do not tell the flavor the reactions are youtube worthy ,great to others , great taste
this candy tasted like sugar without much rose flavor at all br br i ended up throwing most of it out because i do not like so much sugar i prefer strong flavors like a href http www amazon com gp product b altoids twin pack mints wintergreen tins a br br the center of the candy does have a licorice flavor because it is an anise seed but there are better licorice candies out there like a href http www amazon com gp product b twizzlers twists black licorice pound bags pack of a ,sugar , the best
i ordered these candies for the first time and i am hooked they just have a hint of rose the flavor is not overwhelming i really enjoy them highly recommended unique candy ,these are delightful , great taste
the flavor of this natural sea salt is more and a bit richer than the typical table salt we are all accustomed to although describing such is difficult br br one noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt mg per teaspoon versus mg per teaspoon of conventional table salt br br another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is not iodized as our require trace amounts of it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet ,great taste less sodium , great taste
i like it and i find the grinder bottle to be very convenient i like the taste of it and i would definitely buy it again and considering its healthy use for sure ,sea salt , good
i bought this because my husband wanted to try the french sea salt as it was recommended on a cooking show the grinding mechanism works well and he seems to like it i did not realize however that it is not iodized and that may be a concern for some folks who need to make sure they take in enough daily ,nice , not as good as it is
i really liked the taste it is well priced too it is a great and healthy alternative to table salt i even used it on salad ,great product , great taste
i have never had sea salt before but the sodium free got to me it has to be an acquired taste because i do not really like it perhaps if i used it regularly i would not want to go back and perhaps if the salt came from other around the world it might taste different as well ,a taste that needs to be , not as good as it is
this is a fabulous gift i ordered and kept one to try and they are awesome the presentation is great chocolates delicate creamy crunchy and tasty easy to eat not heavy for a mass produced line this is a real winner better than most out there in its price range love the different flavors will buy again great hostess gift ,so yummy wonderful inexpensive gift item , delicious
i ordered this for a friend at south carolina for christmas i want her to try some italian chocolates lol br br the item was arrived earlier than expected but nevertheless it was well packed and only melts on her mouth she totally loves it br br three different taste and flavors of to give three different yummy joy mmmmm ,totally delicious and delightful , not as good as it is
this item was received early it was packaged well and in excellent shape this was a gift and i am sure it will be received well after all chocolates what not to like br br thanks for the excellent service would use this seller again and would highly recommend ,excellent service , great product
i bought this as my first pack of k cups its definitely a good buy assortments are always a little more expensive this one is very well priced you get of each and one of them only has thank god they picked decaf for the small one great coffee if i had not discovered club keurig i would still be buying these ,great pack , great coffee
a sampler pack to so my roommate and i could try the flavors as well as get some of the regular stuff i do not drink decaf so i knew that some of this pack would not be used i figured that the rest of the cups would make up for the loss on the decaf i was wrong this sampler pack was a joke of the cups were decaf and of them were the standard house brew i got cup of chocolate glazed donut and cup of cinnamon roll now i will not be using most of the k cups in this package because it was again mostly decaf this is what they consider a sample pack br br donut house regular br donut house decaf br donut shop regular br donut shop decaf br donut house chocolate glazed donut br donut house cinnamon roll br br some sample ,some variety , not bad
my husband just bought a keurig coffe maker in the box was samples his favorite was donut shop i ordered the k cup for him i was so disappointed out of the k cups were decaf giving me k cups of each of the flavors br i also ordered the wolfgang puck sampler i got flavors each how cool is that br i would order donut shop again just not the sampler ,disappointing , not good
i ordered this because i have had the donut shop coffee before and really enjoyed it and wanted to taste some of the other flavors they offered after receiving my order of the sampler pack i was very disappointed over half my order was decaf coffee and i only got cups of the flavored coffee which was the main reason i ordered it i love this coffee but am disappointed in the so called sampler pack or the lack of variety pack ,disappointed , not as good as i be
i got this on the warehouse deal so i was not expecting much however be advised you will get no regular donut shop and instead you will receive over half of the box as decaf i love the flavors of all of these though so that is ok but i will think hard about getting another variety pack ,of the were decaf disapointed , not as good as it is
if to say you have got to be kidding then he took it and ate it a little later i offered him another one he put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats but when he did not get one he went back and took this one br br i think these might be good for rewards for treats that is it br br they may also be good for my son dog who rarely gets treats because she is overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed at least she would get a treat large treats take her seconds she will probably these one second max br br i like the fact that these are low fat with no added salt no refined sugar no artificial flavors colors or preservatives it says treats baked with natural peanut butter ,little treats but good for what they are a healthy for , my dog loves them
i use these for training treats i have a large and small dog and this works for both of them they are all natural and my pups love the taste i highly recommend these i also tried the three dog bakery apple oatmeal and those were a big hit ,great for training , great treat
i have been using these treats for quite a while and both my dogs love them but both dogs are also way off their food and have been for quite some time and both have been acting kind of off nothing major but just not exactly right well i just happened to quit using these treats for a week or so and noticed both dogs came back to life and they are eating like crazy i cannot for certain pin it on these treats but it is something to keep in mind if you are using them and your pet seems a little off ,just an , great treat
i have never been addicted to candy in fact i do not usually like candy with the occasional exception of halloween and that moment when you just need something sweet but these little guys watch out it might seem like a pack is a lot but hold on to your seat when you put the very first one onto your tongue a pack will seem like there is a of caramels in the world lol br br i tried to come up with a way to explain the most awesome flavor in the world and i just can t to me it is like eating anything and everything in the world you ate that made you feel like that is it br br i can only hope that the does not put a tax on it like because then i would have to put myself into an ,addictive candy very , not as good as i have
one for most other candies they have a great buttery flavor that makes my mouth water just thinking about them i like the fact that they have some great ingredients like cream and butter but i had to deduct one star for the fact that there are artificial flavors in them i am an avid label and try to stay away from any artificial ingredients as far as the taste goes my kids and my husband were constantly in the pantry looking to grab another candy so i can say these were a huge hit in our family it was also a great incentive for the kids to eat their vegetables at dinner they certainly cleaned their plate to have a couple of caramels for dessert if you are having a party these would be great set out in a candy dish there will be none left by the end ,sooo good , great product
great candy as always from werther original candy hard or chewy caramels are but two of the candy they make that is outstanding it seems that you can not keep it in stock and are always out or just have a bag or two left to sale ,outstanding candy , great taste
i reviewed werther original chewy caramels caramel chocolates and creamy filled br hard caramels as a and found the chewy caramels came a close second to the br original hard candies still has that great unique caramel flavor from werther but br now in a chewable form i prefer the original hard candy as those little gems last br a little longer but these are a nice second choice ,a close nd to the original hard candy , great taste
if you like werther hard candies you may like these the pretty good caramels but they are hard and really sticky like do i have all my sticky br br eating a bag now but i wanted caramels and these really aren t the are closely related but so different in terms of texture br br not my cup of tea if you like your caramels really hard not hard candy hard but still you may love these if you think caramels should be soft and chewy you may not br br now i just tried warming them up and that really helped almost tempted to raise it up to stars do not microwave it though that turns them into a mass of goo ,good taste way too hard , not as good as i like
i received this mix along with a waffle maker as a gift it is so good that i keep buying this same brand mix when i run out br br i cut the farmhouse waffles recipe in half so that is cup farmhouse pancake and waffle mix egg cup water tablespoon melted butter and it is more than enough batter for waffles in a full size belgian waffle maker br br easy to make and very tasty ,this is great stuff , great product
nothing can compare to the waffle mix delivered by stonewall kitchen my mom complained about the price but i think the quality deserves the higher price than the regular pancake waffle mix the waffle comes out golden and crispy i was using the presto waffle maker ,best waffle mix i had in my life , great product
i have been making belgian waffles using the stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix for over three years my waffles are undoubtedly the best ever i like my waffles light and crisp i cannot stand a heavy soggy waffle these just melt in your mouth i have made homemade waffles but i have yet to find anything that can compare to this mix ,kitchen pancake and waffle mix is , great product
this is a delicious recipe and ingredients and the one i use a bit pricy but if you do not mind the price point it makes a wonderful waffle combine this with a waring waffle maker and you could be in waffle heaven ,delicious but pricey , delicious
i have to laugh at the reviews that said it was too much work so you have to add an egg a little butter it is well worth it i am not a cook at all and these come out perfect everytime they are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside my family loves loves them the only thing different i do is instead of the extra tbsp of water they call for i add tbsp of vanilla in place of best waffle mix ,great waffles for us non , great for the price
needed your own addition of eggs milk butter etc and this one is no exception in that respect so instead of enjoying this mix on the trail i have been making pancakes in the of my very own kitchen i really do not know what it is about this mix that makes it so good but it does indeed make some of the best and most delicious pancakes i have ever tasted from a mix they are very light fluffy and flavorful and well worth the price and ingredients that you have to add yourself if you have a pancake in your home i would highly suggest you buy some of this great mix its cheaper here on amazon than i paid for it and well worth it in my opinion i have had lots of different kinds over the years and this makes some truly delicious pancakes highly recommended ,excellent pancakes , a great product for a great price
i was expecting great things based on the reviews while it is good it is not great i believe my waffles made from bisquick were just as tasty as these and this costs quite a bit more the instructions are very easy to follow though and i do like the canister for storage ,good mix , great product
i love this pancake mix i bought my first can from whole foods market about a year ago my only complaint is for all the work you have to put into making them at least the pancakes anyway you could just as easily make pancakes from scratch you have to add your own egg whole milk and melted butter one thing i have noticed about this mix is that it is relatively difficult to burn the pancakes it is however easy to them ,good pancakes lots of work , great for pancakes
what can i say they are wonderful and the highlight of each weekend use soda water for the liquid even better ,waffles , great product
i usually make pancakes from scratch and have never found a mix that does not taste off to me this mix is the best my family and i love the way it tastes and it is so quick and easy ,awesome , great product
this is the best tasting pancake mix in the market and it is so easy to make ,great tasting pancake mix , great taste
my family absolutely loves this pancake and waffle mix the texture and taste is the best out there especially when using our waffle maker you can add fruit and other items to the mix and be as creative as you wish your price is great and delivery cannot be beat we recommend it to everyone ,pancake mix , great product
farms waffle mix belgian ounce pack of a and the waffle recipe from a href http www amazon com gp product b aunt jemima pancake mix ounce boxes pack of a in a highly un scientific blind taste test my three children the farmhouse pancake and waffle mix was the choice br br i make a triple batch according to the instructions although i use only one tablespoon of melted butter instead of three and the batter stores well in the fridge for up to four days the triple batch makes waffles on our waffle maker and they are crispy light and golden brown br br this brand is slightly more expensive per waffle than the normal grocery store brands like but our family thinks the taste is worth it as an aside my son has a soy allergy and this mix is free of soy unlike most other brands ,delicious waffles , a great for gluten free
i love belgian waffles and this mix makes a delicious waffle without all the trouble of making them from scratch they are really good and i am fussy i have not tried them as pancakes yet ,great taste and great price a , great product
the label asks for tbsp of melted butter which i never use that much when i use the red mill pancake mix i could only make two perfect round pancakes from it even though it claims the serving should be pancakes the pancake is indeed fluffy as others claimed in the review however i also tasted a lot of chemicals in it i guess one reason it is so fluffy is a lot of baking soda in the ingredient looking at the ingredient label did i realize it has more chemicals than other brands and i do not understand what artificial flavor it has to be added in when this pancake mix is just the normal type with no fancy flavors like cinnamon and apple etc br br in short i am going back to my red mill brand at least i know what i am digesting in my stomach ,disappointed with my first pancake , a great product
didnt really enjoy these after wanting to try something other than aunt jemima from the pancakes tasted strange and sometimes but it might have been due to the poor packaging they came in along with the syrup ,maybe it was just my batch , great product
these pancakes just hit the spot and make me feel like i am eating a restaurant breakfast at home for a lot less money splurge on this and the good maple syrup it really is cheaper than going to or where a meal for two will be minimum ,best pancakes of my life , great for gluten free
let me start by saying my family loves this stuff it has a fairly strong flavor of vanilla it cooks up and light my problem with this product is the recent price increase it was a good product at a fair price but now it is pricey all in all i would suggest that you order this at least once to taste what good pancakes are supposed to taste like after that i would suggest playing with on your own ,pretty darn good but at an cost , great product
my family was lucky enough to get this product several years ago from a friend my daughter will not eat any other pancake mix and everyone i fix them for thinks they are outstanding ,best pancakes ever , great product
kitchen i read the reviews here on amazon and concluded that despite the rather high price stonewall would be a great choice bang it the first time now i do not know if my waffle maker is particularly large deep but i get only two and one half waffles out of each batch following the recipe on the label i do not dare water it down to try to stretch it out and i figure i only got about batches of waffles out of one can the cost per waffle is steep but these have never failed to come out light on the inside slightly crisp on the outside and they have never stuck to the waffle iron grudgingly even though i see the price has gone up a dollar per can i will be reordering but if it goes up any higher i may have to try another brand ,i am a , great product
i am sorry not everyone likes this mix but we love it it is like going to a gourmet restaurant yeah a gourmet waffle restaurant the waffles taste and turn out great and so easy hard for us to believe but it seems it is not for everyone ,excellent , best ever
this is the pancake mix we go to when we do not have buttermilk in the fridge don t think the vinegar trick is worth it so we always do fresh to make brown buttermilk pancake recipe this stonewall mix is a good option and the flavor is the best of any store bought mix by far it might cost more but it really is superior to the other prepared mixes ,a great from , great product
stonewall kitchen products are a big favorite at our house this pancake mix makes the best pancakes you will ever eat we add fresh blueberries to them and top them with the stonewall blueberry syrup which you can buy on their website they make wonderful jams and jellies too as well as sauces and flavored syrups try this pancake mix though you will not be disappointed ,we love kitchen , great for a great price
this is great pancake and waffle batter that was recommended by amazon so i bought it and have been very satisfied with my purchase it makes the best waffles every time i have used it and that being said i am sold on this product i will be ordering more as we really like how easy it is to make i would highly recommend that everyone try this who likes pancakes and waffles it is delicious and very economical ,great waffle every time , great product
i have been using this pancake and waffle mix for about or years and i have to say this is the best the waffles come out crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside i have tried other mixes but they do not compare to this mix i use the waring pro waffle maker and my waffles come out beautiful everytime i follow the directions on the canister and never have a problem with the results ,perfect waffles , great product
makes perfect delicious crisp on the outside and soft on the inside waffles in minutes worth every penny ,delicious waffles in , delicious
i purchased this mix to use with my new presto belgian waffle maker and am very pleased with the results it took cups of this mix to make large belgian waffles and they cooked to perfection after only minutes the flavor of this mix is slightly sweet but there is no aftertaste to it like you get with cheap commercial brands like bisquick i will be buying more for sure ,great waffle , great product
i received this as a gift a few weeks ago it is by far the best home made pancakes i have every had the taste and consistancy is excellent blueberries mix very well with this product and the container is to keep the product fresh and not let in you pay a little more but it is worth it in my opinion ,kitchen pancake mix , best ever
makes very good light waffles seems to be exactly the same as carbon golden malted waffle mix only this is more expensive ,waffle mix , great product
me it is not like bisquick as i thought it might be it is so much better i was shocked and well now the family loves them and looks forward to sunday waffles every couple weeks i even double up the ingredients so i can make extras which we cut into smaller and freeze them these can then be used for waffles and a quick breakfast forget the even as frozen waffles these are great br br what do i like best about them the waffles come out light and fluffy they are crisp and hold up well to being filled with strawberries nuts or whatever toppings you may choose in no way do they feel heavy or soggy they are a snap to prepare and take just minutes in the waffle maker lastly the whole family loves them so despite the higher price it is well worth every penny ,our favorite breakfast choice , i love these
bought this mix along with the cuisinart waffle maker delicious we followed the directions and it made only one belgian waffle the next time we doubled the recipe and it came out the right amount good flavor and easy to use ,pancake and waffle mix , great product
i have a waring belgian waffle maker and was looking for a good batter to use i tried this based on reviews and with add my strong recommendation for this mix br br it was very easy to make and the waffles had a wonderful flavor loved the malt flavor that came through br br i will definitely be buying more when the current mix runs out ,excellent choice for waffles , great product
this mix makes great tasting waffles a little extra work and expense but worth it need to stretch the recipe a little bit to make full waffles on my new presto belgian waffle maker ,great waffle mix , great product
i got this as a gift and liked the flavor but i was not crazy about the texture i like fluffy pancakes and believe it or not imo aunt jemima buttermilk ready mix is the best one out there and it is so easy to make br of course the best tasting waffles are made by me from scratch with buttermilk and all br overall i think buying gourmet pancake mix is one of the biggest waste of money and it still requires you to put melted butter milk etc br i am sticking with my own recipes and aunt jemima if i am in a hurry ,tasty but , great product
stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix is our favorite consistently excellent with a nice flavor the ounce cans are a good value for the quality i highly recommend this product ,our favorite , great product
this mix is the kids and family favorite it tastes like vanilla it is wonderful for pancakes or waffles ,pancake mix the best , great product
number of mixes that taste just as well and some even better i know my taste buds are not the same as yours so what is just decent to me may be great to you i also wish i had bought just one can instead of huge ounce cans i finished the first can i will give the other can away and i will continue trying other mixes until i find the best mix out there br br so far i seem to only be satisfied with a homemade mix for my waffles my preference is for waffles over pancakes but this did not make it on either count i even tried adding things to it but it did not really help maybe it is just me try it if you like but remember buy only one can just in case you are like me you can always buy more ,in name only , a great product but not as good as you are
this waffle and pancake mix is delicious you can taste a subtle hint of vanilla in them they are the only pancakes waffles that my kids love and the house smells wonderful when they are cooking ,great tasting pancakes and waffles , great product
my family loves waffles we have been trying to make waffles for a while but when my second child was born we got tired of all the mixing and measuring we chose this batter mix because the reviews were so great they take no time to mix the dough comes out a bit runny but if you fill the bottom of the waffle iron completely you get the belgian waffles we are using the iron i highly recommend this batter if you like waffles quick you can add a little cinnamon and sugar too to spice it up ,best waffles in no time , great product
i love this pancake mix can not find this exact one in any stores so i always order online and keep in stock at home all you do is mix with water i add fresh chopped banana or strawberries for a healthy option and syrup for honey and cook in a lil butter and you have an awesome breakfast ,i love this pancake mix , great product
a href http www amazon com gp product b e e a stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix ounce cans pack of a br the family said they were the best that i had made the grandchildren ate all that was served to them br the parents who i have served pancakes to for a long also said they were the best they have it was good to see the little ones clean up their ,family breakfast kids kids of us , great product
we have pancakes once a week and this is our go to mix it is incredibly easy to prepare and i add a handful of chocolate chips pieces of banana strawberries peach slices or whatever else people would like onto the individual pancake while it is cooking in the pan no need to buy different flavors you can it yourself ,delicious and easy , great product
we first had stonewall waffle mix when we received it in a gift basket about a year and half ago we have been using it ever since the flavor of the waffles are absolutely out of this world we will not ever go back to bisquick for our waffles ,scrumptious , great product
this has become a breakfast staple for our home now nearly every sunday morning we are making pancakes we have got the vermont syrup eggs sausage or bacon and we are set for the day with a just a light snack type dinner use for the absolute best results ,best , great product
great mixed for waffles family thinks it is the best must try it and order it from amazon i let friends know to use this product ,great stuff , great product
i found it so hard to believe anyone could give this mix star i had to read those reviews two of them seem like for red mill and the other one did not make any sense you must be looking for pancakes or waffles so do yourself a favor and give these a go they are delicious ,the best , great product
the entire family loved this pancake mix it was easy to make and tasted great we tried it with syrup powdered sugar as well as fresh strawberries and apple i would definately purchase this again the only problem is my family wants this every weekend and i have to double to feed my large family it gets expensive quickly so i do not order it as often as they would like ,yum , great product
this was the best pancake waffle mix ever wonderful for breakfast or dinner it was a great price and worth it my husband and boys kept the waffles i made and ate them fast i could hardly keep up definitely recommend stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix you do have to add a few ingredients but it is well worth the effort ,pancake waffle mix , great product
this product is great just add egg water and butter i used oil i will never make waffles from scratch again ,the best waffle mix , great product
we made this purchase based on our daughter recommendation and it is as good as she promised we have a new flip style waffle iron and this mix provides us with a wonderful breakfast we add fresh strawberries or blueberries to the top along with syrup and it is ,the best waffle mix you can find , great product
i have had waffles from other mixes that are too sweet i have also made them from scratch br i like my waffles with no sugar in them because i do not like too much sugar this mix is very good waffles are just the right for me and the mix is easy to prepare ,not as sweet as other , not as good as it is
we received a gift box that contained the stonewall farms pancake mix and they were out of this world they are the fluffy and flavorful pancakes and waffles you will ever taste and the price on amazon is a big savings over ordering from stonewall farms do not shy away from the larger size and the two pack because you will devour these pancakes in no time ,hands down the best pancakes ever , not as good as it is
this is a great waffle mix i have allergies to preservatives and to find food in general that is great tasting without the preservatives is a huge challenge i have tried several other mixes and this one is by far the best i totally do not understand the reviews about the bad taste and all the chemicals read labels of other mixes and you will see this one is not full of all those ingredients there are certain kinds of ingredients that these mixes need such as and when you use real butter not the tub butter that contains water and other nasty stuff these are the best waffles ever ,best ever , best ever
this in the category for sure having these pancakes is like going to a resturant and having exceptional pancakes that you would expect to get at home the price is a bit high but you know that before you buy them so its not fair to the product of that br br they cook up nicely and one pack of two goes a long time ,really good but expensive , great product
i use this as the base for my waffles use small bananas mashed t t vanilla and cup pecans and then blend it all together you need to let it cook a much longer period of time at a lower then normal temperature and you need to cut back on the amount of water used you need to know what the consistency of the waffle mixture should be before you attempt this recipe so that you can determine the amount of water to use this is a somewhat tricky recipe since it is easy for the waffles to stick and pull apart one banana makes it easier but i have had some success with three bananas banana are better ,banana recipe , great product
i am not normally a big fan of mixes but this is a great waffle mix it is quick easy and produces delicious waffles yes it is pricier than some of the other mixes on amazon but i think it is worth it ,perfect for the , great product
this is a great mix i mixed it with milk instead of water just follow the directions ,tasty texture great , great product
add water egg and melted butter for the waffle recipe we eat waffles about once a week br br apart from the fact that it tastes great it has a little vanilla and malt mixed in it has no trans fat some pancake waffle mixes such as which also tastes really good say they have no trans fat per serving but if it has partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in the ingredients there is still some less than than percent trans fat per serving stonewall has none br br we used to have a store that sold it locally but now we do not so i am glad we can get it online br br the can comes with a recipe that is perfect for making two belgian waffles with no leftover batter br br we just bought the regular mix but we are going to try the other flavors next ,best waffle mix ever , best i have ever had
i originally received this mix as a gift from a friend in a gift pack when my family tried it as a gift they loved it immediately it is super yummy waffle mix the waffles turn out tasting so delicious you do not need to add any toppings or butter to them here i am on amazon com placing yet another order for this waffle mix it goes quickly around my house since it is now everyone favorite breakfast item ,yummy yummy yummy , great product
we are into our third can of this flavorful and easy mix and it just seems to get better and better sunday is pancake day at our house and today we had blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup this mix holds fresh blueberries nicely do not over mix the ingredients and you will get nice fluffy fruit filled or not pancakes that are absolutely first rate ,tasty pancakes best mix we have ever tried , great product
we first received stonewall pancakes as a gift we have ordered them x on amazon who has the best prices highly recommend this product will return here to buy more ,best pancakes ever , great for gluten free
i bought this on a whim because i found some jam made by the same company and absolutely loved it i did not expect much more than basic waffle and pancake mix this is so much better br br it easy to use and makes moist fluffy pancakes that are to die for i am never buying bisquick again ,addicted , great product
i have used this product for a few years now this being the first time from amazon i am glad it was there this is by far the best pancake waffle mix on the market bar none ,best breakfast , best mix ever
the pancakes were delicious but they were not as fluffy as the ones i normally make next time i use this i am going to whip the egg whites and see if that helps ,tasty pancakes but a little , great product
i found these at a super gold box pricing one day otherwise i would not have looked twice at pancake mix now we are hooked nothing compares to this mix i have tried every box in the store for our belgian waffle maker and these top them all br waffles are nice and crisp on the outside and super soft on the inside they are so dense they do not absorb syrup or toppings i will buy this over and over again ,crispy and soft all at once , great product
on a whim i picked up a two pack of stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix recently in some measure by the already positive reviews here and i will add to those by noting that we will be keeping a supply on hand in our pantry br br i really did not expect that this easy to prepare mix would yield waffles better than the from scratch recipes i had been using but now the waffle iron is within easy reach after being to the of the for the last few years br br being able to whip out crisp airy light waffles does wonders for one popularity in the kitchen and pairing these with real maple syrup and fresh blueberries is the way to go ,does for one in the kitchen , best mix ever
no matter how you mess up the recipe this mix still makes my family happy in the sunday morning ,we love it , great product
i did not write this review as i wanted to give the product a fair chance i tried it with whole milk i tried it with buttermilk i tried it with blueberries i tried it without blueberries it is by far the worst mix i have tried thus far the flavor is not good seems like it needs more sugar with blueberries it is very hard to get the pancakes to cook all the way through without them i really am telling you all the hype on this product has got to be from people that either work for the company lol or have never tried another high quality mix i honestly would rather eat pancakes from mcdonalds do not waste your money mix is also better and i believe it was cheaper may be better for waffles since i am stuck with two cans i may try that ugh ,stars if i could yuk yuk yuk , not as good as i be
i hope amazon this item always i cannot stand the other brands out there since it got this brand and the price is right at amazon to ,the best waffles , great product
the best thing about this pancake and waffle mix is the can in which it comes i really like the convenience of the can and the fact that it easily br the batter cooked up nicely and the texture was ok however i was very disappointed in the flavor there were stong overtones of chemical flavors br i will be experimenting with my own recipes in the future ,not so great , great product
heavily touted by the reviews decided to try mix is good but not great probably would not buy again ,good but not great , not as good as
this is the best pancake mix i have sent this to several people and they all love it the two pack makes a nice little gift ,delicious makes a great gift , great for the price
following the instructions but using low fat milk and healthier butter it was alright but not great esp considering the price then i it up a bit added madagascar vanilla flaxseed and which i usually do with my pancakes tasted a bit better overall rating stars just ok stuck with the can so we will eat it but will not purchase again i will probably try it next time with full fat milk and butter as it recommended to see if that makes a difference it probably does i highly recommend organic pancake mix also here in amazon tastes so much better and fluffier if you like whole grain pancakes we also love buttermilk mix also here on amazon healthy hearty and so good even my kids love it and best of all it is just add water makes it portable we even took it with us on to hawaii ,nothing special for what you , a great for a great product
when i read the reviews from other customers i was excited about ordering and trying this mix this morning we made waffles with both stonewall kitchen mix and bisquick the waffles from stonewall were ok and so were the waffles from bisquick the waffles were served to several people for tasting and everyone felt the same br br the was that stonewall kitchen product was not worth the significant extra cost furthermore it is not available in our local super market whereas bisquick is stocked this will be a one time purchase for us ,just ok , best ever
i am constantly on the search for delicious buttermilk pancakes because they are my favorite food in the world i like to make my own or get them at the original pancake house which has the best buttermilk pancakes i have ever tasted i decided to try this box mix variation even though i am not a fan of box mixes the stonewall brand has a very aromatic scent but that is where i to be impressed these pancakes hardly rise at all and have a decent flavor and texture but are nothing to over then again i guess i am one of the few who would over a plain pancake anyway they are ok but not worth all that money ,taste better , great product
every week i make waffles or pancakes for my wife and daughter their opinion is that the waffles taste different from but not better than those i make with mix as mix costs a lot less i will not likely order this product again ,no better than , great product
this expensive pancake mix tastes so processed and fake a less expensive bisquick from your local grocery store beats the taste no doubt it is a yucky product ,taste , great gluten free pancakes
this mix makes nice pancakes they smell rich and vanilla y but you do not actually taste it as strong as it smells i will not buy them again because there are easier mixes out there that taste pretty darn close i am just as happy using a brand mix that only requires the addition of water no eggs or milk or flour necessary heck if you want that vanilla smell and taste add an or quarter teaspoon of some extract to your batter br br for sake ,nice pancakes but not as simple as just add water mix , not as good as it is
the price of the mix i had just been purchasing on their recommendation i tossed it in the cart along with some real organic light amber maple syrup br this morning i fixed three small inch diameter pancakes for my man and one for myself just to taste i needed to know br well i do not believe i have ever had real maple syrup before in my life just that sugar processed sold as pancake syrup i have never liked that stuff br that pancake with a tiny of real maple syrup was delicious it was the pancake mix that made the difference br now i am reading reviews to purchase a waffle maker after tasting that light fluffy pancake i can hardly wait to have some waffles made from this mix these reviews are making my mouth water with anticipation br i will never buy any thing else ,delicious very yummy , a great product
this mix produced some pretty bland pancakes followed the directions on the canister and the batter was pretty thin which in turn produced some pretty thin pancakes considering the ingredients that needed to be added it would have been just as easy to create my own buttermilk pancakes from scratch i trying to figure out how to jazz up the remaining canisters i have left maybe some pumpkin pie spice but that will not help the thicken up the batter ,not sure what the is , not as good as it is
i am not sure why but this is our favorite pancake waffle mix just tastes the best to us ,our favorite pancake mix , best ever
makes okay pancakes only marginally better than the standard bisquick recipe they are edible i should say that my kids liked them br br not that great in my opinion ,not too impressed , great product
we did not care for this product at all it seemed to have a funny after taste to it was not worth the cost we were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty ,price taste do not add up , not as good as it is
i bought the mix at the same time as the waffle maker and have been pleased with the results light well baked waffles that tasted good my problems with the mix were first the expense secondly that the mix is very finely ground and flies around when poured and there may some sort of perfume added to it it simply smells too good br br i am happy with the product but will probably not reorder it ,good expensive , great product
i hope amazon always carries this product too i have ordered it twice excellent product for the price yum o ,do not buy any other this is the best , great product
part of me wants to ask for a refund i bought this package of k cups because i wanted a mix of teas when i got my package i was very disappointed to see hardly any teas in the package i know they substituted based on availability but i think it is completely misleading to substitutes with products that do not to the packaged theme i got a mix of gingerbread and eggnog disappointing ,very , not as good as it is
this is not a summer sampler br br the majority of this sampler was hot including hot eggnog hot apple cider hot gingerbread coffee hot caramel apple and golden french toast coffee br br sound like the perfect brewed over ice k cup to you this was the of iced drinks vanilla iced coffee peach iced tea and unsweetened black iced tea br br additionally there were only varieties rather than the listed on the description br br i literally thought they might have mixed my summer drinks for holiday drinks but it was clearly labeled summer sampler br br even worse this item does not generally qualify for a refund beware ,more like a , not as good as i like
thought i was ordering summer tea flavors got leftover winter garbage i will not buy from this seller again i hate iced coffee much less gingerbread and eggnog flavors i cannot believe i just spent that amount of money on crap that i will not ever drink should have waited until walmart carried it does keurig know this stuff is being sold under such false yes i know it says flavors may be substituted that would be fine if they were more teas if i had wanted gross iced coffee flavors i would have ordered such br br on the up side the peach tea i received was very good otherwise do not waste your money ,very , not as good as i be
i got two teas and one type of iced coffe and the rest were holiday coffees and apple cider spicy eggnog gingerbread bait and the only redeeming factor amazon was great and me a refund ,not what i ordered , good flavor
there should be an option for a star rating because that is what i would rate this item br first the sampling was to include varieties but included only it appears that the two flavors out of stock were not substituted with two other flavors but instead a few more of the remaining flavors were tossed in the box i had expected that when a limited edition coffee flavor such as island coconut was out of stock it would be replaced with a different limited edition coffee flavor same thing for the half and half lemonade br second the order was not balanced of the flavors i did receive only were coffees the remaining were teas br the concept of a summer sampler set is a good one but the here was an fail the order is being returned today ,extremely disappointing , not as good as i have
we definately got a nice assortment of k cups but were really looking forward to trying the peach tea which was not included in our shipment i the line stating some flavors may be substituted but one of our substitutions was a hot coffee mix of eggnog french toast and a third winter type flavor slightly misleading from what is pictured ,not all summer , not as good as i like
do not get me wrong i wanted to try the holiday sampler mostly coffee but i ordered the summer sampler with teas there were just a couple peach teas sweet teas and unsweetened black teas i did not send it back because i wanted to try the holiday sampler almost everything i got was the eggnog coffee apple ginger bread coffee and french toast coffee the box was labeled summer sampler so i am sure that this was an accident i did not contact the seller because i ordered it while i was up for and now there is no contact seller button so seller if you see this review message me and we can talk ,the with a summer teas , not as good as i be
really amazon nothing says delicious summer treat to me like a nice cup of egg and when i am not craving egg in the summer it is gingerbread i would really like do not buy this it sucks i am probably just going to toss it if there was the ability to rate this with a negative number i would say ,worst summer ever , delicious
i do not consider gingerbread spicy eggnog caramel apple cider spiced apple cider summer items you cleaned off your self at my expense very disappointed ,not summer , not as good as
i was hoping for the gift box instead i got a cardboard box full of a mixed bag of k cups do not get me wrong if the price is right then i have no problem but the price was a little misleading i was under the impression that this would be in a sampler box not a warehouse box it looks like a mix and match of k cups that fell out of other packages or were returned buyer beware ,are these all the k cups that come out of other , not as good as it is
pack had a good mix of the following br br southern sweet tea unsweetened black tea raspberry sweet tea peach sweet tea sweet lemon tea half half tea and a few different iced coffee k cups additionally there were a few seasonal island coconut which my husband loves br br i would consider purchasing variety packs as my main source of k cups but at a price of over cents a cup i cannot justify the cost however this is a good starting point to down some favorites to purchase in single flavor boxes br br if these were presented in the gift boxes they use for other this would be a very ideal gift house warming present for these hot summer months i do not mind them not being in a gift box but i could have at least used that as an excuse to myself for the price ,variety the picture , great product
the teas seem to brew really strong so use a large glass or dilute after unless you really like strong tea br br it a good pack to figure out which flavors you want to buy in bulk ,ok if you need to out what you like , great tea
very good price and we love our keurig trying the summer flavors are great and will probably order more before the end of the summer ,kcup brewers pack , great taste
i have not had a chance to try these out yet but i thought i would go ahead and mention that i received each of the following flavors br br sweet black iced tea br southern sweet iced tea br sweet lemon iced tea br french vanilla iced coffee br nantucket blend iced coffee br gingerbread coffee br eggnog coffee br br fortunately i am okay with this as i was wondering how the gingerbread and eggnog tasted as well you might feel differently though and might want to know since this seems to be the only variety pack of iced k cups ,received iced coffee iced tea coffee , not as good as i like
there are some types i really like especially southern sweet tea which is actually a lot less sweet than really make it the raspberry and peach are also good and not overly sweet has banned artificial sweeteners from me as they do kidney damage br br i did not care for the and thought there was a bit too much green tea in the assortment but i found friends who like those flavors br br it was to taste test and it was fine for that i do not think i will buy assortments again as i have found what i really like ,interesting , not as good as i like
i got this on a special and we are coffee lovers and like to try different kinds although yuban is our everyday coffee well this was a surprise nice and flavorful not bitter smooth and maybe not as strong as yuban in the same amounts the was all there if they start selling this in amounts for a better everyday price i would buy more but as is its very pricey ,very good flavor , not as good as it is
i got a bag of these and the veggie sticks have not tried the veggie ones yet the sweet potato didnt taste like sweet potato to me just tasted like rice flour and cinnamon and brown sugar tastes like that cereal cinnamon toast crunch i put the the so called skinny sticks in a bowl and added milk taste better ,they should say just add milk , not as good as it is
this was a new product to me they were very tasty crisp and surprisingly delicious i was very pleased with this product ,delicious , delicious
i was very pleased to upon this brand as it is difficult to find healthy snacks for families that do not contain gmo ingredients these were a big hit with kids and grown ups alike added bonus that they are low in calories and gluten free i would highly recommend the sweet potato flavor as well as the brand in general great new company ,great new free snack , great snack
this product was a gift to a far relative it arrived right on schedule in perfect condition and she loved the choices inside the basket i cannot attest to the food personally but she loved it ,perfect gift , great product
i always disliked soggy or soft crackers with my peanut butter and since i also had discovered i was allergic to wheat i wanted and needed an alternative i originally found these rice crunch crackers in kroger supermarkets from the first bite i loved them and i wished i had discovered them years ago the plain variety has just the right amount of salt for taste and they are perfectly crunchy and light i have occasionally had a hard time finding them so i am thrilled that amazon is now carrying them give these a try they are delicious ,excellent rice crackers , great snack
these things are addicting and low in calories and fat too i love the wasabi flavor ,best crackers ever , delicious
i would recomend this product for it is fine qualities and taste really good very nice and crisp for any snack or with meals when you want to help on the lowering of carbohydrate intake ,great for you , great taste
these crackers are a great snack no and they use sea salt very crunchy so its like eating potato chips but better for you comes in different flavors but i prefer the plain i have found that the salt content is different on some purchases sometimes very salty and sometimes hardly any salt must be a problem on the production line these crackers become addicting but its ok cause rice is good for us ,you cannot eat just one , great taste
i got pack of these from my local grocery store and tasted them for the first time to me they taste just like corn nuts they are quite hard so i would not recommend to anyone who does not like hard foods they are crispy and delicious snacks tho will buy more d ,loved , good but not great
this is an excellent product for the non gluten diet they are good alone as a snack or you can make a light meal with them by using these rice crackers as a base for spreads or little crispy sandwiches excellent substitute for crackers containing gluten only criticism wish the price would come down ,excellent non gluten product , great for
first time buyer of ka me rice crackers and i am very impressed these are very light crisp and flavorful they are as good plain as they are with cold cuts fruit etc unfortunately the ones i purchased may be the last i get from this source right after i purchased the dozen packs the price per dozen increased to its present fortunately i have enough to last a while but assuming the price stays the same these are my last ka me ,crisp and delicious price , great taste
crackers are great was glad to find them there is a good selection of flavors my favorite is salted but there are other choices ,rice , great product
local availability of the plain variety of these crackers has been with stores trimming and dropping all but the highest volume buying on subscription makes it affordable and so far reliable ,very good product for gluten and dairy free , great product
these rice crackers are truly delicious w cheese or peanut butter also i can eat crackers w o gluten as i am allergic to wheat eggs gluten and br this is my favorite snack on sunday nights they come promptly and save me money thank you j wolf ,crispy crackers w o gluten , great for
i love these crackers perfect snack for when i need something salty crunchy instead of potato chips or other greasy snack i eat them a lot to hold me over between meals the price on amazon is great compared to my local markets highly recommended ,excellent snack , delicious
bottom line these crackers are a great snack ordering by the case saves some money compared to the charged locally whether plain onion or sesame i ve never tried the wasabi these are a low fat reasonable calorie snack eaten either plain or with something on it the only sad thing is that i first ordered them in for per case ,great snack , great snack
i ordered ka me rice crunch crackers plain i received ka me gluten free rice crackers original all natural unfortunately they have soy products in this cracker and therefore i cannot eat it this looks different from the picture that came with the crackers i ordered apparently i cannot return the box of crackers ,wrong product , great for gluten free
i too have begun to drink only penta water unless absolutely to drink the other water i find that the price of the water is cheaper from the actual website and i get free shipping i feel better overall and wish i could get this stuff by the gallon great product and well worth the price for the improved feeling of well being ,cheaper from com , best ever
you can purchase this for including free straight from penta website br br i really enjoy drinking this i can see a difference with my everyday life ,much cheaper , great
i have noticed about this product br br i accidentally dropped my cell phone into a glass of it and when i pulled it out it had better br i was going to my kids after they tried to clean my computer with it until i discovered that it improved its br i threw some jumping beans into the bottle and the next day i had a pair of baby sticks growing in my refrigerator br br hey if you fill up your shower with this stuff you will not even need soap it comes at a price but it is so super br br if you are tired with the boring old other people call water or are from all that blah that is so bad they cannot a higher market value to and you are so over the cheap readily available and crap your then look no further ,wow this stuff is , good product
i bought bottles of this stuff because of its i have a record washing machine to get the out of the in my record collection you basically the records and vacuum the off using a mix of water and this water is so pure it ever deeper in the and is a better fluid compared to distilled water much less tap oh no water with all its impurities you would not believe how great my records play once they are deep cleaned my wife can always tell when i am playing instead of a it just sounds more alive she says this water is highly recommended for this purpose i may even drink some of it sometime to see what all the fuss is about ,to my , not as good as it is
i love this water it is very i feel better drinking it it is arsenic free free free free and free something about reverse and medicinal grade oxygen really works at work we are no longer allowed to drink soda in our so i bought some penta water i am hooked i like the one liter size bottles i wish you would sell those also i was lucky to purchase this at market buy this water ,water , great product
the site does not list the ingredients for their products online had i known the product was full of trans fats i would not have ordered it watch your labels partially hydrated partially hydrogenated you have to laugh at the ways manufacturers will try to fool the public in the future i will not order a product that does not list its ingredients online so that consumers can make informed purchases br br did try the product and found it tasteless no heat spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth must be from the wax i was going to send it to my son in college but tossed it in the trash instead the sad thing is that they do not have to use trans fats to get flavor they just do not care ,do not waste your money , not as good as it is
i first tried these in a of other gluten free products and it was so fresh so i decided to buy it in bulk and the expiration date was only three months i ended up given most of it away because i did not have time to eat all of the packages i received the taste is ok not too sweet but i found myself getting sick of it fast ,get old too , not as good as it is
these are my most favorite nut snacks sunflower is my absolute favorite but the almond cashew very buttery and rich and are really great too have given as gifts and everyone follows up to ask me where they can buy them great for the too ,best way to eat sunflower seeds , delicious
i love this candy and ate it a lot as a kid it has been very hard to find in any stores i am so glad i found it on amazon the shipping was fast and the product arrived in excellent condition it still has the same flavor after all of these years try this candy if you love coconut you will love it too ,awesome candy , great product
only not air tight but they are also all slit open every serving is slit open in several places the can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible this may or may not keep the product fresh but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can br br with mine i got as much air out of the bag as i could by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw i then sucked the air out until i could get no more air out then the straw out closing the bag in one motion you must do this every time you open the bag to a serving or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream so be prepared with large ziplock bags and a straw if you order this product ,great product poor packaging , good but not great
my month old can easily eat the whole can in one day if i would let him he loves these puffs he just on them like they are chocolate or something that one really loves i just lay a bunch on his little table and he will just pick them up so fast and as soon as he is done he will start for more he does not do that with any other snack it is insane i have tried them and i must confess they are good but can get expensive if baby gets addicted to them i obviously buy these in bulk we have only tried the carrot cheese i think the other flavor because of the green color may him but i will try those as well as soon as we are done with this pack ,i do not know what i would do without this , my dog loves these
i purchased these for our month old twins a while back and they absolutely loved them they are now months and still love them they prefer them over the even though they like those as well below is my pro cons list br br pros br both babies love them br they are overall healthy have less sodium etc than other products of the same type of snack br a lot of munchies in each container br great price on amazon with subscribe save br br cons br they are messy as they easily crumble and there are a lot of tiny crumbles in the bottom of the container br this particular flavor is sort of flavorless to me however my twins seem to disagree with my taste buds ,we love these , good for you
i am a mom of kids with my older two i had such a hard time finding a snack for them that did not have so much sodium when my rd came along introduced i was so thankful to find a snack low in sodium and with a vegetable too and to top it off it is organic so i know it is free of pesticide residue and gmos ,healthy snack , great taste
baby loves to feed herself and these are a great on the go option we have tried other brands gerber but this is her favorite by far and i do not feel bad giving them to her as i know that they are high quality hubby tries to steal a few away here and there as well ,super healthy and baby loves them , great for
i have bought them many times good quality and good taste baby love it and i love it too reccommend it ,good taste baby love it , great product
i bought this because it is organic cheese puff my son love gerber cheese lil crunchies i thought he may like this too i subscribe it once a month now there is cans not open the idea of mixing cheese and carrot is great but there is no taste for this cheese snack there is no cheese flavor in the puff my son opened the can and keeps giving the puff to me my son love happybaby yogurt melts beef stew happy baby banana blueberry and spinach mango and pear this cheese puff does not work for him ,my son does not like it , not as good as it is
while i worry that i am teaching my baby to be a these are perfect for the in between times for my year old the label tells me that they are a healthier choice for my baby than the typical grocery store aisle alternative i like to keep these in the car and diaper bag for helping to calm my little one while waiting for meal etc i do not think they taste awesome but he sure eats them like they are going to disappear that makes me happy ,great in a healthy , great product
we love these the cheddar carrot flavor is far better than the green flavor my daughter age likes them both but because we snack on them in the car i opt for the cheddar carrot which is tasty to me too i love that they are healthy and i can feel great about giving her these instead of some colored mystery things love em ,yummy healthy snack we love , great taste
my two boys love the happy munchies cheddar cheese carrot they request them as their snack as they watch their show on t v i love that they are low in sodium includes mg of choline per serving which is great for their eyes and tastes great also they are kosher certified which is a plus as well i love to put these in baggies and keep them in my purse for emergency snacks on the go healthy crunchy and a must buy ,yummy , great snack
my year old son does really like these certainly taste better than some of the other finger food snacks the only issue is there are lots of crumbs in the can they come in so it gets messy if you want to dump them into a baggie for on the go ,tastes good lots of , good but not great
these are a great alternative to chips i was not sure how they would be based on other reviews but i am glad i bought them and wish i would of found them sooner i have twin month olds and they cannot get enough of them i like them too ,fantastic , great chips
my son is only mo so he cannot say it yet but he loves these he gets excited when i even take them out of the pantry i like the fact that they are organic and also have carrots ,my son loves these , great for
my son loves them and i can give them to him knowing they melt in his mouth so will not choke and they are good for him too ,great snacks , great product
the title of my review says it all as long as it did not get cut off these have a lot more air in them than the gerber little crunchies these crush extremely easily and get dust crumbs all over the place also they do not taste nearly as good as the gerber little crunchies they might be better for you and i like that it has a hint of veggies in it but my month old is not very happy with them she will snack on them if that is her only option and she is really hungry but she definitely will not choose them we first got these several months ago and she is had the same reaction to them every time since then ,very easily and they do not taste as good as , not as good as i be
happybaby baked organic cheese and veggie snack cheddar cheese carrot ounces pack of br br this is six items should be installed but i only received a i with amazon contact but nobody reason i please as soon as possible give me thank you ,why i received only one , delicious
i purchased this at my local health food store and i am enjoying it immensely the juice has a nice robust texture and it is not overly salty the flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing br i combine it with odwalla carrot juice for a well above average vegetable juice that is a good energy and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices br enjoy ,very tasty just the right amount of salt and fresh flavor , not as good as it is
to a baby or toddler on the go our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added just fruit for smaller ones not good to let them handle it themselves because they love to squeeze it which gets things everywhere but older ones can feed to themselves i like the size rather than the bigger one that plum organics has for some of the other flavors it that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later you can also take this size on without having to have it tested for not the case with the bigger pouches i also like that it is bpa free if your little one likes them ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store ,great tasty healthy , great product
i really wanted my kids to love it these are very convenient on the go and should be delicious or so it seemed unfortunately none of the kids cared for it it tastes like stage baby food very bland and is very runny too so it can get quite messy if you squeeze a little too hard or if the child drops it ,not impressed , not as good as it is
old i wish i had found them earlier they are organic taste great are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient i always keep some in my purse and in the car when we are out and about they are not messy unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch which only happens for us when she is not hungry br br the plum organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together they taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies you can find some varieties at reasonable prices on amazon others are more expensive for some reason babies r us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for each if you buy them in sets of that is usually when i stock up for the next two months ,tasty and convenient , great product
my daughter will start school this fall and i was concerned about lunches and fruit to go choices we have bought several different fruit pouches at a local organic store and she and i loved these the most it it not overly sweet and a strawberry variation as well tastes really good she can easily eat of these every day br i really like the fact that it has no sugar and color added it is organic just fruit puree br br i personally do not like banana variation but it is just because of my own personal preferences i like fresh bananas more than cooked other than that my daughter approved all of flavors to stars ,great idea yummy product , not as good as i be
plum products are such a wonderful and yummy idea for the toddler heck even the adult from time to time i keep a full stock of every flavor fruit pouch plum makes for toddlers they make a great snack to throw in the diaper bag or back pack whether you are packing a for a trip to the store school lunches or going to these pouches have saved the day many many times i have even grabbed one or two to add to my lunch when no other fruit was available for me and it was really good i have and will always recommend plum to every parent i know ,is the best , great for
i love plum organic pouch got this one on sale my baby and toddler love this so much my years old always ask me for more ,love it , great product
my son loves these and they are great to throw in your diaper bag or take with on trips a lot of time i cannot find fresh fruit while we are out and about that my son he is can eat these are great because it is actual fruit and he can eat it straight from the pouch just make sure you help them the first couple of times or else you might have a bit of a mess ,great for or in your bag , great for
have had other brands like this before and have always enjoyed them these were a really good bargain on sale ,would buy again , delicious
my month old loves this has no problem holding it sucking the food out this is great for on the go ,yum yum , great product
this makes feeding on the go so easy my one year old will suck down a pouch in minutes and she loves them ,what an awesome idea , great product
i bought this for my month old son who has become a very picky eater as of late i wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and veggie servings each day this does the trick he loves them and he can feed himself what more can i say oh i actually tried one and they really are good ,yummy and my son loves them , my dog loves these
it is hard to get my recommended amount of fruit servings a day i buy fruit but it always seems to go bad before i can eat it all i bought the banana also and really like it too i like to add it to my oatmeal or spread it on top of my peanut butter toast or just by itself to the ingredients it has different fruits not just peach and not just banana obviously i am ok with this just wanted to throw that out there there are multiple things i love about this product here goes and not in any particular order br easy to open convenient resealable pouch br it tastes great br all natural fruit no nasty preservatives or chemicals br organic br great for everyone not just babies br the price is good compared with other similar products and i love the free shipping ,great for too , not as good as you are
not as tasty as the strawberry but still very nice great to throw in a diaper bag or purse but definitely a good deal when it is on sale ,great tasting , great taste
these are awesome and if you know where to find the discount they can be super inexpensive i love the all natural ingrediants and i actually find them to taste great i actually put a little in my older kids oatmeal and they love it too i make of my daughters baby food but this great for on the go or as a supplement br br my twin niece and nephew who are months old love these as a snack and my sister says they are so great for car rides or trips to the i highly recommend these over any other baby food product ,my old daughter and old and love these , my cats love these
this is perfect for babies and toddlers on the go we started using the baby version when my daughter was an infant it is so easy to throw a pouch and a baby spoon into the diaper bag now that my daughter is older she is able to feed herself with the pouch just give your toddler the pouch and they will squeeze suck the fruit out of it not only is the packaging great but the fruit tastes good as well and yes i have tasted everything that i feed my daughter my daughter loves this her whole face lights up when i hand her a pouch ,great product packaging , great product
i know these are super trendy right now and i totally wanted to love this product or to be more exact i wanted my toddler to love this product he took one taste handed it back to me and said why you gave me baby food mom i tasted it and he is right it tastes just like jarred baby food same consistency not any thicker too if your kid likes the packaging great if your kid doesn t then it is just really really expensive baby food i am going to give the rest to my baby as the toddler is not the least bit interested ,baby food , my cat loves it
this flavor is awful we absolutely love all the other flavors but goji cacao maca is really difficult to get down i give all the other flavors stars ,yuck , best ever
delicious and nutritious we live for coconut and nut treats since we do not eat grains when i want to splurge i pick up a bag of these from whole foods or my local health store they average around here unless they are on sale i would to be able to buy these in bulk yum yum ,these are amazing , delicious
we have been feeding this to our dogs for over a year over the past few months we have had a problem with the cases of pot pie cans some cans were full of chunks of fat and a thick lard like gravy with no veggies and some cases were fine with chicken and veggies etc what happened to truth in labeling we also had the problem with the cans being only half full sometimes our dogs were getting bad from the fat in the food so we had to stop giving them merrick br they need to start testing their food again it used to be great look at the old reviews from last year and before ,half cans and ingredients , my dog loves these
i have been feeding this wet food to my dogs for years and as my husband has said if you through it in a crock pot and served it to me for dinner i would have no idea it was dog food but i am a little upset with the fact that the cans are not full in this last case some were even only half full i have dogs and this stuff is not cheap ,cans , great product
please think twice about purchasing this product especially if you have a small breed dog i was by the cute labeling and sold by the ingredient list but i twice fed merrick canned food to both of my dogs and both times both dogs were diagnosed with pancreatitis an illness which is dangerous extremely painful to the animal and which requires i am not sure if the fat content in those particular cans was high or if merrick uses an ingredient additive that somehow both of my dogs but this food made them very ill after their second for pancreatitis i spoke with other folks who had stopped feeding merrick to their small breed dogs for the same reason the food caused vomiting diarrhea and in their pets ,please think twice , not as good as the dog
i am just passing along the star rating from our three miniature this stuff is a big hit at our house we give them each an easy to digest kibble that is good for them and put a tablespoon of pot pie on top no more turned up noses now they wolf it all down be sure to mix it up real good before serving ,great , great product
i just switched from merrick whole earth brand pate style to this upgraded line by merrick and my dog loves it this a great for dogs that like human food ,my dog love this , my dog loves it
we adopted an year old earlier this year and heard lots of about special diet but we could not pass up trying a can of this dog food sadly just because of the name well she loves it so now it is her special occasion food we mix half a can with a cup of dry x day with no nasty side effects she also likes and the valley offerings from this company it is high in protein and works for us ,we love , my dog loves it
so happy we found this online for a reasonable price my two dogs love this stuff and it does not upset their stomachs plus i love that it is not made in china or something when you look at the food it looks pretty close to people food you can see real chunks of chicken and veggies i do not want to give my dogs any manufactured stuff but also do not have the time to make our own dog food ,my love this stuff , my dog loves it
i give merrick canned food as a treat and mix it to my dog dry kibble and the cat even gets a taste every now and then the chicken pot pie smells better than any human chicken pot pie i can remember ,more than a stars , my dog loves them
my dog thinks he was born into the and is to fine dining each evening accordingly he will not eat plain kibble a scoop of this on his dry food a little water to make gravy and we are good to go ordering a case from amazon was way easier than picking up individual cans at the pet store too all in all a success for us ,gets my picky dog eating , my dog loves it
that particularly with the canned food i could open it and recognize ingredients like a potato looking like a suprise potato or a pea carrot etc my dog loves this merrick food and has never been healthier our vet constantly comments on her blood work levels coming back at perfect levels and she is almost her coat is really healthy and probably what is noticed by most pet owners and yet not the most pleasant aspect to discuss is that she has almost no gas i do not give her much if any people food either but when she is given other brands she can be really hard to sit near on i think the phrase you get out what you put in here as well i will not switch from merrick food ever my only regret is that i did not start feeding my little four one merrick sooner ,more please , my dog loves them
i had heard this was wonderful canned food so i tried it for my very fussy schnauzer i was first surprised to see a layer of fat on the top when i opened the can i that off and added a couple spoonfuls to her dry and she sniffed it and walked away she does seem to like the merrick dry food i chose the buffalo flavor and my girl says this is a winner ,was surprised with the of fat on top of , great product
to try it he loves this food it has chunks of potatoes carrots and peas not to mention chicken and apples the only downside about ordering it from amazon is the delivery method the day the food was delivered a van pulled up in front of my house and left the cases of food i had ordered outside of my chain link fence next to the needless to say someone could have taken it if i had not seen the delivery woman drop it off i am also disabled and if it had not been for my next door neighbor being outside at the time i could not have gotten the cases of food into my house without her help many of the cans were also extremely dented delivering items this way is not acceptable i would have given this review stars if it had not been for the delivery ,my dog loves this food , great product
i have a special needs pet and searched for the right food since amazon has been a five star i chose to have pot pie shipped many of the cans are dented so i have to toss them or return this is a big hassle but would not ever feed a dented can to my beloved boy best to purchase at the pet store ,dented cans , great product
this canned food has real chunks of chicken in it dogs love it looks and smells better than human quality canned beef stew like ,for dogs dogs love it , my dog loves it
watch out for the fat g of fat per g serving br br i guess i knew that nuts have high fat but somehow i was stuck on the calories br the flavor of these is delicious the wasabi flavor has a hint of smokiness br br from the packaging br ingredients almonds vegetable oil canola safflower and or sunflower sugar modified corn starch salt soy sauce soybean wheat salt horseradish onion spice coconut oil and or palm kernel oil garlic maltodextrin yeast natural flavor acid disodium and disodium br from california br serving size g one bag br calories fat cal br total fat g sat fat br sodium mg br potassium mg br total carb g br dietary fiber g br sugars g br protein g br calcium iron vitamin e magnesium ,calories but , not as good as you are
now let me start by saying i did not buy this tea as a diet supplement i bought this because i tried it from a local store as i was looking for a tea that had some peppermint in it but not so much it was over powering like a full peppermint tea this has just the right amount of peppermint combined with a green tea overall it is a pleasant taste that i could drink all day ,great tea , great tea
this tea is very good i discovered it while visiting in california the moment i got home i searched local stores for it and i was not able to find it finally i decided to see if amazon had it and they did and i bought two boxes as long as they make it i will buy it ,tastes very good , great tea
the tea tastes great and helped me curb cravings during dieting the tea was inexpensive and came packaged in a pretty box the bags are flimsy but i just throw the bag in a tea ball with no worries i will continue to keep this on hand as part of my tea collection ,is , great tea
i love this tea it has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea i do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but i can live with that no big deal the quality of tea makes up for that ,fine quality tea , great tea
i found this exact same stuff at the dollar store it is pretty good not as good or as strong as my loose whole leaf tea but for the price it cannot be beat bags are never as good as loose leaf i use it if i want one quick cup i steep my loose leaf tea times so i have to have time to drink cups i gave this stars because it is a good deal for the money purchased from the dollar store if i make myself a mug and because it is cheap i use bags i would have been disappointed if i had paid the original price on here for it though ,found at the store , not as good as i have
account this tea is not the same as the one that came in the black box the tea is brown and this tea is green the is the same inside as the other and the fragile tea bags are the same but the tea is different this one comes packaged much but it does not taste the same i have lost pounds in the last months by drinking this tea in the morning and only water throughout the day that is my only diet change i used the other tea for a month and half and this new tea for weeks now i dont want to stop taking the tea just is in case it is the to my weight loss the next order i will try the other tea that you have to pay for shipping on i hope i can find this stuff because this is not it ,not the same tea , not bad
not much else to say i keep a box in my desk here at work and i can enjoy a cup anytime nice flavor and no bitterness so i can drink it straight without sugar br br pros flavor and value br br cons it cannot do my for me that is really about all i can think of lol ,nice flavor great value , good but not great
i got tired of for tea at teavana so decided to try this brand of oolong tea and was pleasantly surprised it has a wonderful flavor and like the previous reviewer i just put the bag in a tea ball to compensate for the poor quality of the bags you just cannot beat the value of this tea ,great for the price , great tea
this is a high quality oolong tea and i cannot go back to bigelow that is for sure the taste is great it is said to have benefits and the tea bags are a higher quality that do not come apart easily ,love this tea , great tea
i got two bags from my friend who got it from his friend who said it was so i them in a zip lock when i got home mos later i opened it and had some today i am online trying to find more ,quality tea , good
so far nothing extremely impressive the taste to be honest is not anything special i ve had much better and for the price you get what you pay for a bit annoyed that the string is super cheap and always falls off but it came nicely packaged and arrived much faster than i expected by like days so i suppose that is a plus all in all if you are looking for something keep looking as for the benefits have not really noticed anything new but i will keep drinking for a couple weeks and see how that goes then update my review till then yeah maybe i should i invested in something else but since it was barely any money i guess i did not do too bad ,eh , not as good as it is
just got my teabags today and the first bag i made tea with the part of the teabag where the string is connected to the bag tore across the bag after seeping the bag remained intact though the second bag while unwrapping the teabag the tag ripped the bag right open br br the tea tasted fine not very strong like most other oolong teas the quality of the tea bag is like some flimsy material two out of two broke i guess i need to be more careful with the others ,tea is okay t , great tea
you just cannot beat the taste of the original bubble gumballs it really does not matter that the taste only last a minute or so but that is why i bought the tub the tub by the way is very convenient and was shipped to me in a condition if your longing for the classic taste go for it you will not be dissappointed ,good bubble taste , good but not great
holy cow i have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this also it has enough salt to kill an entire family of use it in your garden do not eat it ,tasty but , great taste
i had high hopes for this product when i first opened the package because the noodles had a great texture and the sauce looked appealing the food was easy to prepare at my however to me the taste was very oily and flavorless i am a big peanut satay fan and was expected more spice in the flavor ,too and lacks flavor , not as good as it is
it tastes better than it looks was the first thing i said the a skeptical co worker looking at my peanut satay as it came out of the microwave unfortunately it is as fattening as it looks so i likely will not be purchasing it often i could see this mixing with chicken or beef and tasting even better though ,really good , not as good as it is
while its not traditional satay it is very good the oil is ok cause without it it would be too dry i had some of these that were a year and a half old i made it and it was fine i will buy again ,pretty good stuff , not as good as it is
i adore this brand of peanut satay noodles unlike the other ethnic foods in box ka me noodles and sauces are flavorful and delicious however there is certainly a downside this dish is greasy fattening and high in calories if you read the nutritional information you will find that this tiny box contains two servings that are high in fat and not very filling br br my advice split this dish with a friend and serve with a small serving of rice the sauce is flavorful and potent enough that it into the rice an instant and tasty multi dish meal ,surprisingly flavorful but with a friend , not as good as it is
this is not real peanut satay but for the price it is not bad i like to get these and keep them in my desk at work for the days that i do not have time to go out to lunch these are really easy to make just mix together the cooked noodles and the bag of sauce and microwave for about minutes you will not get a restaurant quality meal out of this but it is decent for just over a box the box says it is servings but if you are not mixing in any meat or anything it really is only serving ,not real peanut , not as good as it is
a nearby fresh and easy neighborhood market a number of gourmet imported products and i enjoy trying them one is a variety of soups from canada today i had the butternut squash and red pepper soup quite good smooth and mellow mild taste but delicious goes down real easy and it only comes to calories per serving servings per can alas the sodium content is a bit higher than i like otherwise very good br br gary peterson ,mild taste but delicious , not as good as you are
i have been using this product for years and was happy to find it on line since our local place farms had closed i love it especially in my salad dressings ,excellent taste , great product
the pomegranate molasses arrived on time and in good condition i encountered this as an ingredient in a cookbook and it did not disappoint we it just a little with warm water and used it as a side sauce for roasted asparagus at a barbecue and got many rave reviews from our guests vegetarian and non vegetarian alike i recommend both the vendor and this item ,wonderful , not as good as it is
fast professional transaction i needed this one ingredient for a new recipe and it turned out great now i just need to find more uses for this stuff ,stuff , great product
only pom i ve ever used but this seemed to have the same flavor the chef came up with for a pomegranate relish for fish it seems to have a bit of a brown appearance though where the one the chef used was a brighter red color ,satisfied , good
i have two recipes i am anxious to try that call for pomegranate molasses i have called all the specialty and best markets in the area and no one heard of this much less carries it it is common in recipes goes with shrimp fish chicken beef and pork i was delighted to find it on amazon and look forward to using mine in a fabulous short ribs recipe i am also passing along the info to my friends so they can order their own or i may give as gifts to my gourmet cook friends ,great find , great product
i would recommend this product i received it in a timely manner and the price was good ,i would recommend this product , great product
my mother secret recipe for great meatballs she adds a couple teaspoon of molasses to the meat and the taste comes out incredible br br once i set up my own household she gave me a present pomegranate molasses of my own i learned to use it in variety of recipes from to meat sauces it has a wonderful taste both tart and sweet at the same time it has deep red color and looks very appealing br br it keeps almost in the refrigerator it blends well with walnuts adds a unique flavor to beans adds wonderful flavor to poultry gives a nice taste to fish gives an astringent edge to salads and vegetables and is a great for lamb and pork br br i like its flavor even just diluted with cold water as a drink or adding tart flavor and beautiful color to br br ali review ,love it i use it for so many things my recipe , great product
to look around online to buy more thank god for amazon br br now granted my bottle will likely last years if all i do with it is make fattoush one half at a time so i have used it in a few other things i added a teaspoon to a lemon chicken marinade a tiny to a bowl of greek yogurt had to add honey too cuz it was sour a tiny amount added to christmas salmon cream cheese i used it in a persian stew of chicken and walnuts i used a few tablespoons of the sticky stuff in a barbecue sauce and it was the best barbecue ever br br just do not do what i did and try to replace the molasses in molasses cookies with pomegranate molasses what a horrible mess the cookies looked normal slightly lighter than normal but the smell and the taste ,do not use this in of regular , a great product
always wanted to make my own hummus and dip this brand of tahini i would never tried before or seen in supermarkets so i decided to order and try it excellent by itself or in recipes highly recommended ,excellent by or in , great product
we love to make hummus and love to make salad dressings one of our kids favorite foods is tahini over cold noodles ,best i have ever had and we buy a lot of it , great product
having lived in the middle east for years our family loves and we make a lot of it this is the best brand i have ever found in the u s i like the taste and the texture of this one and it mixes wonderfully with the other ingredients i found it somewhere locally then when i went to buy more i could not find it again is so much better than all the brands you find in health food stores or supermarkets and the price happens to be about half of what most stores charge for a similar amount of tahini i was delighted to find it on amazon ,best i have had , best i have ever had
i have never used tahini before and my hummus was good but always something was missing after i found out of tahini i ordered it and it was shipped fast and used it the result was amazing one spoon into the hummus prepared from one bag lb beans and i had my favorite ready to go ,good as a , great product
very bitter and not nearly as thick as expected very runny actually there are better brands out there ,bitter , not good
we purchased these for our son to give out when his baby boy is born they make a very nice of the new arrival they are however very hard if you actually want to chew the bubble gum ,nice , great taste
hi br br my first grandson was born and i wanted everything under the sun to celebrate this is a wonderful idea that has been around for a very long time however everything was fine and wonderful except the fact that they just were not fresh these little bubble gum cigars were as hard as a rock the moral of the story is that being a fun item the shipping was as much as the cigars themselves at least they could have been fresh and not hard ,it is a bubble gum , great product
i purchased this item to celebrate the birth of my grandson i should have opted for real cigars they might have tasted better these cigars were very hard and hurt my teeth to chew not to mention that these gum cigars were much too sweet ,real have tasted better , not as good as it is
ordered some from an amazon fulfilled associate normal amazon shipping etc the cigars were cracked and stale how does chewing gum and break no way it was fit for consumption br easy return process ,stale , not as good as it is
this product arrived in a timely manner in good condition and it was a hit with the family when my son arrived ,great for non , good
when our third child and first son was born we sent our oldest to school kindergarten with these for her friends to celebrate it really made her feel important at school and helped her celebrate the birth of our little boy she loved doing it and her friends enjoyed them too btw we did clear it with the at school first so no hate mail please ,fun for our daughter , great product
i have nothing but good service ever since i started ordering from amazon com keep up the good work ,everything e ordered so far , great taste
you are buying these cento tomatoes are san marzano sauce tomatoes they are d o p certified and this point is often they are from the they are the second best in terms of absolute flavor bright from proper acid deep from proper natural salt sugar balance you probably cannot get better tomatoes fresh unless you know a specialty or do it yourself and have no day job cento sells many others much cheaper that are not these br br the price per can is good the best deal is if you have amazon prime and get regular shipments i get three large batches per case enough to feed the that forms on sauce day br br most people are happy with the many good canned tomatoes especially when you look at the poor genetically fresh tomatoes at the supermarket but if you are a these are what you want ,best value for the if you have , the best of the best i have ever had
i have had a lot of san marzano tomatoes in my day both fresh and canned and typically they are the best tomatoes on the planet i opened the first can from this order and the tomatoes were not very good at all nothing like i was used to i later noticed that the can does not have the d o p certified label like the photo on the amazon page does these tomatoes are not d o p certified and are not real san marzano tomatoes they are a cheap imitation the seller tried to the label of real san marzano tomatoes so they could sell them for a higher price i would recommend you stay away from these you can get better tomatoes for a fourth the price at your local grocery store ,cheap do not buy , not as good as it is
the label is misleading cento actually sells two kind of san marzano with the same label other than one that says d o p certified you will receive the one w o the d o p if you order from amazon i have made the mistake in the grocery store not realizing cento sells ones are d o p and ones that are not and did not realize till it was too late the true d o p ones i have to say make the best sauce you can taste the difference ,false , best popcorn ever
buyer beware the label on the amazon site clearly states d o p certified but the product received does not match the site label and does not state d o p certified this is bait and switch and i will a complaint with amazon ,false , not as good as it is
dop san marzano canned tomatoes are the finest canned tomatoes on the planet but i can get these for literally half the price at my local grocery store is this unusual boston is pretty heavily italian in some areas maybe that makes a difference i do not understand why anyone would buy them at this price check your local grocery store before you buy them at this price ,great product awful price , not as good as it is
you order and pay for d o p certified san marzano tomatoes but you will receive certified which means absolutely nothing a true sm tomato will have an d o p on the label plus the san marzano this is false advertising if you the picture shown you can see on the upper left side partially one of the you will not receive this dop label you will receive another tomato from somewhere in the region under the cento name typical marketing amazon refuses to take returns on this item so beware ,you do not get what you order , not as good as it is
since a dop product is not readily available at my local grocery stores i got really excited when i saw the photo of this product at the amazon website because the photo states that this product is d o p certified br br but when i received the shipment it was a huge disappointment it was a different product than what the photo promised i can buy the one that was delivered to me at my local grocery stores very easily very disappointing ,different product than the , not as good as it is
i have used cento san marzano dop certified tomatoes many times in the past and was always pleased with the quality of these great tomatoes br that said this is the st time i have ordered this item from amazon and all cans arrived completely dented and up br terrible presentation for an expensive item br as an aside none of the cans i received has a dop certified label but only certified and no on the side of the cans so i am not sure if these tomatoes are actually dop certified or not ,all cans were up and dented , not as good as it is
certified and it did not say by who there is no usda organic label either i also knew all these things before i bought them since they are well in the amazon reviews already so i was not surprised by what i received br br on the plus side they are better tomatoes than i can buy canned in the grocery stores locally so i am happy enough with them and i used reward points from my amazon com to buy them so they were essentially free to me br br would i buy them again maybe if could not get any of the d o p certified san marzano tomatoes then yes i probably would as i said they are tasty and i do like them better than what i can buy locally but they are not the top tomato when it comes to what i can mail order ,false and misleading product but they do taste good , not as good as i like
i discovered these wonderful tomatoes and yes they are worth paying for unfortunately in my area they are approaching bucks a can and never go on sale walmart has them for about dollars a can but i prefer not to be down to that store the local italian mart advertised san marzano tomatoes cans for dollars too good to be true yes in fact these are very ordinary tomatoes i am on the hunt for these wonderful tomatoes at a good price they turn an ordinary recipe into a gourmet experience ,love it except for the price , great product
the can that is shown says d o p certified but when my relative ordered them from amazon com the cans that were shipped only indicate certified one can buy these non dop at any walmart what do they mean by certified certified as to what br br unfortunately the are making of amazon com as a i am staying away from cento products entirely fool me and amazon once shame on cento fool me and amazon twice shame on me and amazon there is no way i can make this review fun ,beware not d o p , not as good as it is
complaints here in the reviews however amazon is really great when it comes to problems like this with food items they are shipping me a new order no charge and i get to keep my original order i am hoping my new order arrives in better condition these san marzano tomatoes are not dop certified even though the description says they are many people have complained about this in the reviews so i am surprised amazon is still listing them as dop certified however they are very good quality tomatoes and certified organic i have also noticed the price of this item fluctuates often so here is a tip place it in your shopping cart and then save it for later check your cart daily and wait for the price to drop i paid but i have seen the price as high as so it to be patient good luck ,not but organic , not as good as i be
these are not dop they are just certified which means nothing significant they should go a step further with a little more and write department certified real dop tomatoes are much better ,not , not as good as
i love san marzano tomatoes and cento are great they have the greatest sweetest taste ever worth ever penny and than some ,the best , great taste
they tomatoes are certified san marzano but not dop like the item shows in picture i called amazon and they sent me another box of for free to fix issue the new shipment was still certified not dop so please know this tomatoes are ok but not the best fyi ,the picture and they are not , not as good as it is
i purchased a case of these tomatoes a couple of months ago and the cans were so badly bent and my can opener will not open them i complained to amazon and they shipped another case out right away but those cans are worse than the first case i will not order again ,damaged cans , not as good as it is
the product image is misleading the image has the tomatoes as d o p certified but the tomatoes i received are not ,d o p not really , not as good as
these tomatoes are perfect for italian recipes full flavor not too acidic and very italian always the best choice for italian cooking ,great italian , great product
most if not all of the cans were dented in some way however it is a cheaper method of purchasing this product ,a little disappointing , not as good as it is
this is a fine product why sure it is has a flavor that on other tomato has an earthy taste ,time , great product
merchandise was not damaged during shipment but supplier send me damaged and incorrect merchandise of the cans were badly dented and the cans they shipped were not dop certified they sent me lower standard merchandise received full refund from ,damaged , not as good as it is
i have read past reviews where people complained about receiving dented cans with this product i had a previous shipment where all was well but not this time the shipment came in a badly box but i thought all would be well when the interior box was i was very surprised to find a badly dented can in an box this tells me that the can was already dented when packed amazon should their source for this product the tomatoes are superior but the packing stinks ,dented can , not as good as it is
the product is great but it is priced nearly twice what it for in local markets i dont mind paying a little for convenience of home delivery but this is too much ,too expensive , not as good as it is
received different than pictured labels just say certified not d o p certified do not know if that is the same and after a couple of orders i am not going to put the effort in to find out br also came with basil i want tomatoes only not basil br a couple cans dented like others have said br my case was now its br i m over the tomato thing i will buy what i want in the store ,not sure what i got , not as good as it is
of the cans shipped of them had very very serious dents in them i am not talking i talking serious dents so dented that i truly thought of throwing them away my husband stopped me though because at a can he felt that it was too wasteful in my local grocery store items this dented are put into a reduced price because they usually do not move otherwise a href http www amazon com gp product b c cento san marzano certified tomatoes ounce cans pack of a ,dented cans , not as good as it is
this product is indeed fabulous and you can get it at many grocery stores for a lesser price overall a great product and makes awesome red sauce to i find it very that you refer to your wife even if you are this is not the place for that sort of if you really hit your wife your a domestic abuse is not a laughing matter and i was personally by your review try to maintain some amount of class when on here i am sure that is something you are of doing judging by your disgusting and review ,needs help , not as good as it is

this formula is a life saver our month old had a little bug which made him spit up a lot and be very fussy with this formula he barely spits up at all and has been so much happier br br ask your doctor for a sample when we took our baby in for his tummy the doc gave us a full sized can of this formula to take home and try considering it costs about retail this was great br br pros br reduced spit up and gas br reduced fussiness br easy to mix up br br cons br baby cannot go as long between feedings probably because it is easier to digest br br you can also get free cans of similac one advance and one sensitive by mail if you at their website great product and great customer service ,up and a baby , great product
i decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy however this formula made him more gassy the formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby i tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles but that did not work ,this formula is terrible , great product
good price for product i had started my baby on the similac soy formula but it was too much for my son tummy this formula was a change unfortunately it came at the funky time of similac big recall of all the larger containers i was buying the oz can from the wholesale store and the smaller containers were all sold out of the local stores not a fun situation finding this pack at a reasonable price was a much needed and appreciated rescue ,sensitive , great product
are the most expensive and this one is loaded with processed corn syrup solids br br from baby colic also known as infant colic three month colic colic and colic is a condition in which an otherwise healthy baby or screams frequently and for extended periods without any discernible reason you will know it if it happens to your baby and it is awful to not be able to do anything to immediately relieve your baby it contains dha ara and iron but all baby formulas do because it is required by law br br lactose free formula is expensive is because it goes through a very and difficult manufacturing process i am told by the company public representative so much food in the u s is prepared with corn syrup solids so that should not be a worry i am told ok but i notice the rate is high ,one day but it is corn syrup , great product
great formula our son is not getting stomach pains like with the regular similac and he actually likes the taste the only thing is that it is way cheaper at costco per oz tax amazon is not willing to price match ,b m has it for oz way cheaper , great product
we just changed to gerber good start gentle due to sugar in this product this did seem to work better than a couple other formula but i decided to try something else when i read about sugar we just changed over to gerber good start gentle and it does so far seem to be working better he is still gassy but he has less pain and doesnt seem in nearly as much discomfort when eating he is a little colic but still loves to eat i do this this is a good product and i am sure the sugar is safe i just would rather not give extra sugar at this age weeks good luck ,worked well but had added sugar , not as good as it is
while i have not purchased this from amazon i have used it for many years it makes a super layer for my version of and mixed with cream can be incorporated for pate br i do not live in any more so it is getting more difficult and thanks to amazon i find it it available and in larger cans i plan to order soon br br br con chef ,great for , great product
is a it is nothing more than shredded coconut and does not even dissolve in a high speed commercial blender br br unless you are using this product to manufacture a dark chocolate coated coconut patty to me it is useless my was to use it as an additive in a healthy shake it ended up the shake as i had to resort to chewing the tasteless coconut pieces rather than drinking the shake br br additionally the way the product was packaged there was no protective cardboard preventing the the top package when the box was opened br br if i could have rated this product zero stars i would have the only redeeming quality was that it was rather inexpensive i gave one package away for free to a patient who loves coconut and she gave it back to me two days later complaining that it was terrible ,do not buy this product you are looking for coconut , not as good as i be
i bought this same brand from an online indian grocery store that usually has excellent products i was able to turn it into cream butter using my super blender and adding some water but it barely had any flavor i usually buy the brand of coconut cream which is quite tasty and flavorful and read another review for a different product for making your own coconut cream my complaint is not the or texture mine was just virtually tasteless ,little flavor , not as good as it is
although i had some concerns about product with initial shipment my concerns were far by the excellent prompt and courteous response from vendor about my concerns customer service that seems a these days was absolutely exceptional will definitely keep this vendor in mind when i have need for other supplies products ,excellent service from , great product
bought this for our young son and was disappointed in several of this dispenser br br it is made of cheap plastic and arrived w the and cracked br br the top does not screw on it just pops off w very little br br part of the appeal for me was that this dispenser is operated what the description on amazon does not tell you however is that a is not necessary to the candy furthermore when the is just barely turned the candy usually two pieces flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w o your hand there to catch it a young child is often not enough to turn the and put his hand out to catch the candy br br the dispenser only came w enough candy to just fill the bottom of the br br it is very much over priced at ,disappointing , not as good as it is
the m m candy machine works just fine but the finger hole is too small for adult fingers to the candy it does a m m lover because of the small amount it ,great little , great product
i was disappointed when i received this dispenser it said a large dispenser it looks like something for a child to play with i bought it for my husband to put in his man he is a huge m m fan i buy him a tree each year from the m m i was hoping it had more substance to it i also did not realize i was unable to return this item ,too small , not as good as it is
i am on my first jar of this and am really enjoying what it adds to my vegetarian one pan mix ups of onions garlic vegetables usually tofu rice or pasta or quinoa sometimes olives or br i may have purchased it at when on sale i will be buying many more jars of this mixed spice paste it is not really a paste more liquid with easily basil leaves i highly recommend this chili paste ,paste w sweet leaves the in dishes , great product
this deal on amazon with the prime free shipping and or the even cheaper subscription is very tempting if you make a lot of desserts with this like we do one of our favorites is layered graham crackers this pudding mixed with frozen whipped topping and topped with a can of melted chocolate frosting lots of stores are discontinuing name brands so this is a great item to buy here ,great to keep on for , great for
my husband loves pudding and any kind of dessert at the end of dinner this is a great way to his cravings while not being full of butter and fat i love that i can add whatever i want to it to fancy it up a little i love to put cocoa powder and make a more elegant tasting chocolate pudding or mix it with berries for my kids ,good for , great product
like always this label is the best in desserts and this ounce vanilla pudding is not the is easy to make and fast and the size is the best for a little families the vanilla flavor is fantastic ,a wonderful dessert , great product
you can substitute nut milk coconut milk or goat milk or even soy milk for the milk in this instant pudding br br if you add coconut cream and toasted coconut you have coconut cream pie pudding if you add some raw cocoa powder you have chocolate pudding you can add some cream cheese and have cheese cake base you are only limited by your imagination this is also excellent as an addition to a cake mix about a packet and an extra tablespoon of liquid ,excellent base mix , great product
delivered by ups this product is just about perfect it does not have a smell and the dogs love it it is much less expensive than prescription dogfood and our dogs are thriving on it you can even see an occasional pea and or carrot no grain to worry about ,good stuff , my dog loves it
i have two terrier mixes and they love this product i mix it with their dry grain free dog food and they just gobble it up like no tomorrow i am happy that amazon has this product on subscribe and save it is one less thing to worry about since i know it is going to arrive every two months br br when i know i am going to be out of the house for a long time i take this product and it inside a kong toy oh em talk about keeping these add pups occupied for a period of time br br like the other buyer said you occassionally see a piece of carrot or potato here and there i like looking at the ingredients on this product there is no added water mechanically separated meat or other by product good job ,dogs love it , great dog food
bought lb each of five different mo fudge recently from a school i am not much of a chocolate fudge eater prefer peanut butter but the dark chocolate fudge is incredible so rich and creamy almost too creamy had to throw it into the fridge to make it easier to cut but if any fudge can turn me into a chocolate fudge lover this can ,wonderful , great taste
this tea is absolutely incredible addicted after first taste so delicious the smell the taste it is a beautiful experience i just ordered more and gonna try both regular and decaf ,amazing worth every , not as good as it is
i love this tea and drink it at least twice a day the flavor is both strong and sweet the tea stands on it is own never needing sweetner if you are a cinnamon lover you have to try this tea and even if you are not it is worth a try ,amazing tea my favorite , great tea
i am fairly certain this is the same tea sold by caribou coffee i think i could be considered an addict the flavor is so good lots of cinnamon and slightly spicy because of it price for is good and less than i have been able to find it elsewhere ,delicious tea , great tea
after having to give up coffee years ago due to a medical condition i tried many different kinds and favors of tea until i stumbled upon this in a small bakery that had recently opened nearby i loved it and have been drinking it every morning since over the past couple of years the sachets are perfect for a larger mug the paper wrapped are fine for smaller cups or it is a hearty tea that i find satisfying and delicious ,totally delicious , great taste
as a person who love cinnamon scent and flavor i find this tea amazing i was used to drinking the plain black tea at work and this blend is a nice change from that i can probably only have one or two cups a day because it is pretty sweet but i will continue to drink it probably every day enjoy ,delicious tea with a great aftertaste , not as good as it is
love this tea its like drinking liquid red i hate herbal teas b c they all taste and smell like potpourri but this stuff is awesome ,love it , great tea
a co worker gave me a couple of the harney sons fine teas hot cinnamon spice sachets to sample the cinnamon spice flavor is wonderful these teas are not available at my local grocery stores i was glad to find them for a reasonable price on line ,favorite tea , great
i love this tea which has a deep cinnamon aroma and taste it is equally good as an iced tea full marks ,great spicy taste with hint of sweet , great tea
i drink a lot of flavored black teas and this is hands down one of my favorites the scent is and the flavor is bold and sweet at the same time if you love spice this is a must have tea ,most delicious tea , great taste
super tasty super delicious best tea ever sweet and i actually like these better than the individually wrapped tea bags ,excellent , delicious
this is an excellent tea very flavorful the cinnamon is fresh and powerful and overall it is slightly sweet without needing any sugar excellent with milk or straight ,excellent tea , not as good as it is
this is more than just a tea drinking a cup is like a beautiful experience it has a multi flavor it really does i never considered myself a tea drinker but i ordered it once at a starbucks and was hooked ever since on special occasions or even when i am down i treat myself to a cup of this warm and tea ,a beautiful experience , great tea
it is that good heaven if you like cinnamon tastes sweet with no sugar ,just , a little
i was actually surprised at how good these muffins taste i have reordered a case and they are gluten free ,taste good , good but not great
traditional english muffins are usually fat free or having very little fat this little should be called something else all together br br closer to what i would say a is having all of the buttery taste and fat to go with it br br terrific if that is what you are looking for in an english muffin but not what i am looking for i would rather save the fat for a chocolate dessert ,watch out for the fat , delicious
had this sent to me in the flavor was enjoyable but not to spicy it is made with i would surely say this is one of the best salsa i have ever had ,top quality salsa , not as good as it is
i love but my supermarket sells one box of muffins for instead i bought the mix boxes for and each box makes muffins instead of per muffin the mix only requires water eggs and works out to about cents per muffin and very easy to make that is a great deal ,the best healthy , great product
i buy these through the ship and save program because they are a staple of my breakfast and snack routine br light flavorful and full of vitamins these only take minutes to bake with minimal extras i am vegan so i use egg substitutes flax seed in place of the eggs with tbs water and they still bake perfectly ,delicious fast , great snack
i really like the frozen corn muffin tops but the mix resulted in a dryer product i used the paper muffin liners and i think these might have added to the ,the are better , good but not great
i found this muffin to be dry and very disappointing if i cut it up and put it in a bowl with yogurt it was ok would not order this flavor again ,not a corn for a , not as good as it is
better then i expected i notice there was some complaints that the muffins were dry br so i sprayed the mix before cooking with a butter flavored publix spray which is canola oil same as butter spray br this did the trick they were great ,mix , great product
i generally like products the corn muffin well for calories it is not bad but if you are expecting anything like the sugar fat laden junk that your local bakery sells look elsewhere this is like a healthy that does not quite cut it but they are not bad for the same amount of calories the chocolate one is more of an indulgence but this one is good for a bland breakfast treat especially baked fresh br my kids are happy to get any extra snacks so they approve i send with them to school for a snack im glad they get fuel and vitamins ,its not what used to but its and healthy , not as good as i be
the picture shown is for three packages and the price is fair for three but i was only sent one but was charged for three also the item sent was not the item shown i can buy the item shipped all day long at any local grocery store i went to amazon because i was looking for the type shown br br when i contacted the seller and told them about this they said they would give me partial credit for the item but nothing for shipping seeing as how i was shipped something i did not order i should be to a full refund including shipping i was not offered that br br if i could give this seller negative stars i would any future buyers beware ,this , not as good as it is
too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest ,standard , best ever
the pain in the neck features of brewing loose tea with a tea ball or strainer just throw in the right amount of tea tuck the top into the bag and that is it you now have a teabag of your favorite black tea or whatever makes you happy throw away the neat little soggy bag when you are done no mess at all br br i ve decided to get these on as a subscription with a pack arriving twice a year that way my family can have three cups or pots of tea each day this size works for both and maybe a few more on the weekend before running out we have been using these bags for several months now and are still as happy with them as we were when they arrived if amazon keeps offering these bags i am sure we will keep buying them ,wow what a deal , great tea
the tea bags work well with loose tea and buying the pack of six makes this a good value but what you are not told is that the bags are the large size better made for large pots and not single cups ,tea loose leaf tea bags pack of , great tea
i like loose tea and hate having to clean out the metal holders these bags are ideal as they let me make a pot or just a cup of tea and then throw it in the pile to be reused for my garden ,tea loose leaf tea bags , great tea
at this point but i will not recommend them either because of the size quality and high price compared to so many other products to choose from keep looking is my advice br the other products i ordered well met my standards this one was a what is the old saying buyer beware i fell into that trap big time br here is the product link at this time br br a href http www amazon com gp product b great rolls with meaty chicken filling inch a br br wish you luck if you try this product but again buyer beware br br update my little dog got very sick not too long after i wrote this review i contacted service with even more reason to not like this item and they refunded my money how is that for customer care great thank you amazon com you are terrific ,for the price , not as good as i be

the price and calories a piece they cannot be beat they are great for training in addition to putting them into food toys to keep them occupied i also provide a steady supply of these to my youngest pup during nail as he has quite a bit of anxiety and these treats totally take his mind off of the scary at his br br first ingredient is wheat flour so if your dog happens to be allergic to wheat these will not work for you my dogs are not allergic nor do these treats give tummy problems so i am happy ingredient list is short that is another plus it is not a long list of artificial this and that br br i give my pups both the liver flavor and the cheese egg flavor to mix things up a bit the cheese egg ones even smell like cheese yum ,i feel good about these treats to my , my dog loves them
a href http www amazon com gp product b z all natural dog treats by bear cheese egg oz resealable bag a these are absolutely great treats for training and for use with overweight dogs at only calories per treat even an overweight dog can feel like they are getting treats too especially in a multi dog household where one dog is overweight others are not taste must be wonderful since there is not anything my dogs will not do for these tiny treats so i am very pleased with them for many reasons great products ,great low calorie treat for dogs or for training treats , my dog loves these
my dog breeder sent home a baggie of cheese and egg flavored bears for my maltese puppy i used them to reward him from the get go and he will do just about anything if he knows this treat is coming a great training aid they are also small enough to give often and are made with good ingredients i carry them in my pocket and my little guy keeps an eye on that pocket ,the best training treat , my dog loves these
i love these treats for my two german i think these treats are great for even large size dogs my dogs absolutely go crazy for them and they are only calories per treat perfect for training sessions i also love the texture of them you can put them in your pocket without a ton of or gross smell this product also has a ingredient list opposed to so many other dog treats out there you can pronounce all the ingredients in the list and you know what they are getting ,these are amazing , my dog loves these
purse or car without worry we keep a small bag in the car for travel to when our puppy does not bark at people walking by one by the door to when she goes to the bathroom outside and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel br br the one downside to these is that because they are not as stinky it can be harder to use them to get your dog attention if he or she is like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these and they will take on some of the scent we use a href http www amazon com gp product b pro treat beef liver freeze dried dog treats ounce a br br our dog loves all flavors ,great low calorie training treats , great
the treats were ok my main complaint is they were small about the size of a which made it hard to give them to my medium size dog as a treat one treat just not do it this package should be labeled for toy or small dogs ,dog treats , my dog loves these
too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest ,standard , best ever
juice is very good i like it as much as the tart is smart and with the price increase it is considerably cheaper even with subscribe and save this will be my staple tart cherry juice from now on ,good stuff , great taste
i have read a couple of the studies on the anti inflammatory potential of tart cherry juice and became convinced that it is worth a try as a yo athlete i like this product b c the label tells exactly how many cherries a tablespoon is equivalent to so i can make an informed choices as to how much i use based on the number of cherry in the studies i have read i cannot vouch for the of the label but i have no reason to doubt it i have grown to like the flavor especially mixed with lime seltzer ,really like it , not as good as it is
i am training for a half marathon at the start of my training i was not taking cherry juice as i increased my long runs each week my knees and hips were so sore i started to take this cherry concentrate and ever since then i have felt pretty good i take the juice every morning with my breakfast it has a very strong flavor but mixes well with apple or orange juice the half marathon i am running in is this weekend and i feel ready for it thanks in part to the cherry juice helping reduce the pain this stuff works for me ,great for , great taste
bottom of my neck i started drinking this juice three months into what will likely be a four to six month recovery because my doctor has put me on a long term anti inflammatory medication i am not allowed to take over the counter medications like and i can say that taking a glass of this juice has the same pain killing effect as taking two i enjoy two glasses a day one in the morning and one at dinner the only down side is the sugar which is really the only processed sugar i eat during the day the juice tastes good and the quality of the syrup is consistent and pleasant br br i usually do not go for miracle foods or diet but this juice simply works this is the real deal it will not cure pain but it will inflammation and faster healing of arthritis and ,you your life , a great product
this juice is actually concentrated as advertised of all the juice concentrates of any flavor i have tried this one is the most concentrated and i expected the others to be as concentrated but they were all thin i guess tart cherry juice tastes like fresh black cherries in general but has the more tart best flavor ,juice , great taste
tastes like drinking a cherry pie i purchased this for my mother and she told me it works quickly it is also supposed to help lower blood pressure speedy delivery it is not stars because of the high price ,cheaper than other brands , great product
every bit as good as any other brand i have tried fantastic taste and easy to use this stuff can become addictive ,delicious tart cherry , great taste
to take this as an added bonus i have noted a marked decrease in how sore my muscles are as well i wish i had heard about this sooner br br i follow what it says on the bottle once twice daily at first i was just using a tablespoon and licking it out of the tablespoon tbs oz which i still do in the mornings but good this stuff is tart the first one is not too bad i think mostly because your taste buds are in shock the second one really gets me though lately i have been mixing my ounce into a cup of orange juice at dinner which looks disgusting but tastes surprisingly really good br br i really hope this product comes back in stock soon i do not think i could go without it and i am hesitant to switch to a different brand ,helps with and , not bad but not great
good and reasonable for drink a product that is good for sleeping and i will buy again if the price stays reasonable ,tart cherry , great taste
this cherry juice concentrate taste very cherry a href http www amazon com gp product b country spoon red tart cherry juice concentrate oz a i like this product and perhaps i will order this cherry juice concentrate again ,excellent , great product
this is very good but i prefer the liquid cherry juice less messy to deal with and the concentrate does not seem to go as far as the liquid juice just my preference ,tastes like fresh , a little juice
i bought bottles of this tart cherry juice because they were cheaper than tart is smart they may be providing the anti that they say but they completely failed me in helping to sleep better at night i returned bottle to amazon went back to tart is smart i used to wake up times a night have trouble getting back to sleep being nearly retired i can sleep in if i choose with my formula i get to sleep fairly quick wake up hours later get hour or two after visiting the bathroom this product may work much better for you but i found one that works for me will stick with it forever i hope to read your opinion of this product soon ,does not me to , great taste
too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest ,standard , best ever
i have managed to find these crackers in other countries on our travels but had run out i love that they are individually wrapped small packets in a stay fresh container this makes them great to carry in my purse take to work or on for snacks etc also love that they are not overly salted like so many american brand crackers company that shipped them did a great job fast too ,my favorite crackers , great product
i don t note that the box says pound ounces but the description on this page says z whatever a z is if they meant oz it is incorrect it is a oz box in any case i was able to find it even cheaper online than the price shown on this page where amazon whenever you buy stuff like this be sure to consider the bottom line price product plus shipping and check for alternative amazon pages where it is cheaper on this page it is for a oz box with free shipping if you total order is or more but on this page br br a href http www amazon com gp product b d flakes crackers x g a br br the same oz box costs only shipping or total over a dollar cheaper than on this page so buy from amazon but not from this page ,the best crackers ever , i love it
if you like and you want them in a bulk amount this product is for you the came perfectly sealed and in excellent condition there are no ,exactly what i ordered plain and simple , great taste
memories of going into the candy store and for that sweet and sour chalky taste of this classic candy while it is a hard candy it is easily chewable and has pleasant texture and taste you really cannot go wrong with this candy the only drawback is it is hard to stop at just one and before you know it you have eaten an entire roll ,candy , great taste
i have ordered these a couple times now they arrive super fresh and sealed every time i used to buy a roll a day from the gas station now i have a stash at home that is available anytime yumm ,mmm fresh candy , great taste

my dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy she specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula unfortunately my dog hated the salmon and rice and it extremely fishy i tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better i have heard numerous good things about wellness from my dog as well as other pet owners and pet store employees my dog is to the new food well however i can tell he does not consider it the most tasty of choices probably because it does not have the artificial flavoring in it but i would rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste ,great healthy dog food for dogs with food allergies , my dog loves it
i got this food for my dog that is allergic to corn wheat potatoes flax fish and pork i had the hardest time finding a food that he was not allergic to i am so glad i found this food he is finally eating and starting to put on some weight it is a little pricey but i think it is worth it for such a good product ,great for an allergy dog , great product
instead of simple solution lamb rice i was sent simple lamb oatmeal but my dog likes it next time i will make sure i am sent the right food i did not know until i had open and put the food in my lb container ,i got the wrong food but dog ate it up , my dog loves it
who we adopted from a puppy mill situation eats by gulping down her food from her years when she had to fight for food she is the dog we were by getting sensitive stomach food she was having a problem with vomiting the good news is if we get her to eat small meals a day and try to get her to slow down problem solved yet if she eats without chewing is still a problem br br i gave the food stars because if we do make sure she chews it by feeding her a couple morsels at a time like giving treats the food stays down therefore working for vomiting which was a huge she was vomiting times a day since switching she has stopped vomiting i do not think our dog is the only one that eats fast and it does take much longer to feed her ,great for dogs that their food , great for my dog
i have a dog with severe allergies we have been fighting for years the vets always recommend mass produced allergy formulas like science diet i cannot stomach feeding my dog that type of garbage but simple is a good alternative made with quality ingredients and the dogs love it too great product ,great alternative to diet diets , my dog loves these
before my oldest golden started eating this food he got a lot of ear infections he ate grain free food but he still got them both my dogs like this food and their coats are nice and shiny and their ears are super clean i really recommend it br br while you can get it for cheaper on other sites you pay for shipping br br i only wish amazon had more than bags of it each time ,best dog food no , my dog loves them
quality food but the price is very high amazon free ship over ,quality at high price , my dog loves it
i was so excited to get my whole wheat pizza dough after ordering it i got it two days later the directions are easy to follow and the taste of the crust is phenomenal the toppings i added to my pizza were shrimp chicken cherry tomatoes mexican cheese blend and turkey canadian bacon the pizza turned out great only weight watcher point plus value per slice this is a better alternative to other leading pizzas ,the best pizza i have ever had , the best
my husband does not like whole wheat anything but he liked this pizza dough it was very simple to make and spread on our pizza stone we put pizza sauce and cheese on and it was great ,pretty good , not as good as it is
great stuff love that it is organic and raw but later saw same thing tj for less than half the price ,yum , great product
i love this organic raw honey br br when using it in my tea i do not need a lot and the taste is great br br honey is also helpful with and healing so other than consuming it i also use it on my hair and face often the darker the better ,love it , great product
cant find this flavor in the stores so bought them here online like them so much better than the peppermint ones i also like the cinnamon ones yum o as ray states ,love these , good
the local merchants quit stocking this was pleased to buy this on line so i can make french canadian pea soup again stars for ability to obtain since quality is not that much of a factor all of bob red mill products are star ,great to be to get this again , great product
its hard to find this stuff locally usually my parents have to bring it to me when they visit was pleased to find it on amazon br br makes great tasty we eat a lot of it so its nice to know i can get it here again when i need it ,yummy , great product
when tea is decaffeinated is all the flavor removed or is this just lousy tea in any case all you get from a couple of these tea bags in a oz mug of hot water is hot water true the hot water is slightly after five minutes of steeping but there is no tea flavor at all very disappointing ,no but no taste either , not as good as it is
full bodied tea no loss of flavor even though it is decaffeinated comes stored in its own heavy duty zipper plastic bag to ensure freshness during shipping a great value for a good tea ,great value , great tea
a dark house blend the front of the package noted new if you like starbucks house blend try this as a last shot attempt before packing up my tassimo for storage i purchased this new t disc coffee tasting my first sip i was so happy really really happy my coffee is so important to me and the gevalia dark house blend is amazing it is a rich full bodied cup of coffee and as i drink this day after day i am starting to think it is even better than my old favorite starbucks flavors it is as bold as starbucks with no bitterness at all i would love to hear what others think of this i am very pleased with it and i am so glad that i am able to go back to the of using my tassimo brewer because they make a great t disc again ,in a dark cup , not as good as i have
this is the best thing from gevalia i was drinking the starbucks and verona before the i tried the dark breakfast from gevalia but it is horrible i can only drink it after adding the espresso that makes quite a nice cup with a good kick to it i even need a little cream in it to smooth it out a bit br br but this one is just right it is a nice strong cup that does not need cream but can take cream without losing flavor this is the first hope i have had for saving my tassimo machine i do not want to go back to the keurig br br p s i would still like a good decaf option right now i use the gevalia signature decaf and add a shot of gevalia decaf espresso to jazz it up ,finally something good from , good but not great
finally some new varieties of tassimo i drink everything from dd to starbucks to nespresso to good blends from fairway this one is pretty much right on with the description dark brew good medium body it has a strong flavor but is smooth and no aftertaste at all reminiscent of how sbux does brew their beans but i like this better than the sbux house coffee it not quite as and is unlike many of the other gevalia coffees for tassimo that i just do not like b c of their aftertaste bitter to me this one brews at degrees at least mine did which is a bit hotter than i would make a cup of latte for example at so be careful on that first sip but i do think this one a keeper ,good coffee hot , good coffee but not a good price
together with many customers i was frustrated when tassimo and starbucks ended their my coffee was verona br since that time i have tried various alternatives gevalia espresso tassimo noir tassimo roast but with limited and varying degrees of success br after reading a previous review i sent off for a supply to test it i love it br br i was on the point of giving my tassimo machine away no more br br a great start to the new year ,this is the replacement , not as good as the other
when i want coffee since i am not a coffee snob i do not like to get crazy with the but this one has a very deep and pleasing coffee flavor full bodied is a good way to describe it as opposed to a lesser bodied coffee that may smell good but tastes watered down when you drink it this is definitely the best coffee i have ever tasted out of a home brewing machine and even better than many can it has no aftertaste and it is not bitter you can drink it black with no sweetener and enjoy it or add some cream even if you go heavy on the creamer it does not lose is flavor buy it and ignore the starbucks haters seriously starbucks coffees are not as good as everyone makes them out to be dunkin donuts coffee has them beat in price and quality ,great coffee the best for , great coffee
i love this coffee its dark but not bitter and smooth as silk its a big cup size oz so its great in the morning when i do not want to get up for coffee too much if you have a tassimo you should have this coffee blend on hand ,great coffee , great coffee
it tastes pretty decent but i was not aware how pricy they were when i bought them i paid for a pack of what a rip off ,good but , not as good as it
these were so so good and i love that they are made with whole wheat flour and a healthier sugar substitute not aspartame or splenda i looked at some peanut butter cups i would just bought and they are a higher percentage of saturated fat than these cookies i worry a lot more about the sugar in a product than the fat unless it is made with soybean oil or lists trans fat i list this as one of my healthy snacks and since i am over size with no health problems i must be on the right track of what healthy is br br one customer said hers were greasy maybe hers were in the heat and the butter got hot i am now placing my third order for these they are worth it ,absolutely loved them , good for you
i love these cookies but this batch was stale very hard i had to dip them in my coffe to eat them easily ,tasty but stale hard , great snack
my husband is gluten sensitive dairy sensitive and diabetic so it is very difficult to find desserts for him usually if it is gluten free it has too much sugar for example i tried a box of these cookies for him he tried them and said that they are surprisingly good br br they are not even though they are shaped like those types of cookies they are regular cookie consistency there are just a few in a package so they are rather expensive however they are less expensive than buying all the materials yourself and having them fail can you tell i have made some in my time as a specialty cook lol ,good dessert for gluten sensitive dairy sensitive and , great for
if you are ordering cookies beware the cookies arrived in crumbles so if you want a box of stale crumbs order away ,a box of stale , great snack
two of aunt cookies contain of daily fat allowance the cookies are so full of grease they fall apart they may be sugar free and gluten free but they make it up with mostly fat i cannot even give them to my grandchildren ,cookies , great snack
i was looking for some nutritious snacks with fiber and came across these i have tried this variety and the oatmeal flax ones and both are very good they have a texture but are full of flavor would not say they are like home baked but there is no artificial taste at all they are generous in size inches diameter almost an inch high and though not calorie each depending on the variety they have grams of fiber each highly recommend these for healthy snacking or even a quick breakfast ,just great , good for you
whole grain ingredients and good tasting most products have mostly white flour with very little whole grains but these cookies are primarily a whole grain mix it is nice to have a treat that is more nutritious and still sweet enough for my sweet tooth there are several varieties of cookies and they are all good ,and satisfying , delicious
yes these are wonderful and healthy cookies but this is a rare bad deal from amazon really dab nutrition they are charging about including shipping in less than a minute of web searching i found the same quantity for about shipped enjoy the cookies but buy from someone else until the price comes down ,great cookies terrible price , great snack
yummy good flavor i wish they were softer and not so crumbly and for some odd reason they give me heartburn and i never get heartburn i still like the flavor ,good but not great , good
span class tiny length mins br br span these cookies are so great watch our video to see how great they really are ,best healthy cookie i have ever tasted pretty sweet , delicious
for the price i got lbs oz of biscotti i it on my kitchen scale cut into big pieces add the shipping and handling and that comes out to a little more than per piece this is approximately what my local bakery charges per biscotti too when they have some so i guess this is the going price for homemade biscotti these days br br the flavor is very and the is just perfect the biscotti is hard and crunchy but it is not so hard that you could not eat it without as some biscotti are this biscotti can be eaten as is or can be in coffee tea or cocoa i mine in chai tea and it tastes great and the biscotti does not fall apart when br br i like the almond flavor but i wish this came in anise flavor that is my favorite biscotti flavor ,nice big pieces big almond flavor , not bad
this coffee has a smooth dark finish that i love my husband gets other dark blends that taste like charcoal to me this one is very smooth with just a hint of sweetness i wish that amazon had it on its monthly purchase program would love to save on it however i was glad to find it besides green mountain as prime members we can get our coffee replaced in shipping days v a week or longer over at gm sweet ,new favorite dark k cup , good coffee but not a great price
this is the fifth different type of coffee i have tried with my keurig coffee maker right now it is with a newman own k cup as my favorite a couple k cup products seemed fine when i first tasted them but have come to pale somewhat in comparison with other flavors and makes br br this is a really tasting coffee it does not have a strong taste but goes down very easily there is a richness to the taste as well br br bottom line i will be purchasing this again when my supply runs out as i continue experimenting with different flavor k cups ,i like this , not as good as i have
great coffee rich robust a coffee lovers choice if you like french roast or italian roast you will like this coffee ,great coffee , coffee
i love this coffee very dark but not at all bitter i finally found one i like as much as jet fuel ,yummy , great coffee
my husband loves strong caribou coffee but i like the milder one or breakfast br type i will drink this but caribou of all kinds is a great coffee no matter br how strong it will not disappoint ,caribou coffee strong , great coffee
this morning for the first time in my life i tried caribou coffee only because i had run out of my usual type of coffee which i would usually brew and drink in short i should not even mahogany caribou as coffee you know why it has far more anti and effect on me than i had previously anticipated from now on i will only drink mahogany caribou ,the best coffee for and up your , great coffee
you can taste the wood in the respect it taste like the coffee was roasted over wood it is very smooth i detect no bitterness or over roasting nice flavor my favorite the k cup line my old favorite was donut shop but not any more i am not as pleased with the other caribou flavors but this one really surprised me ,most flavor i have tried , not as good as i like
most caribou coffees are too weak for me this one is a delicious exception it is right up there with revv emeril bold or van houtte a dark bold coffee without tasting burned or bitter ,wonderful dark coffee , great coffee
caribou mahogany is my favorite k cup coffee it is got a great rich taste it is dark but not bitter ,the best k cup , great coffee
it has a nice strong flavor with no bitterness br br how strong is it i would say it is similar in strength to auto drip using rounded tablespoon of coffee per oz of water ,this is good coffee , good coffee
i have been drinking green mountain dark magic and really enjoyed it however i wanted a change after some searching i discovered this coffee and am glad i did it is got an excellent deep flavor that i really enjoy strong enough yet not overpowering i recommend you give it a try ,good bold coffee , great coffee
i agree with the other positive reviews i see here nice flavor strong ish no bitter grind y or coffee flavors to mess it up br br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano br br my favorite k cups are br starbucks french roast br starbucks caffe verona br starbucks pike place roast br green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve br green mountain double black diamond br green mountain revv br green mountain dark magic br br other k cups i have tried coffee people jet fuel green mountain dark magic decaf emeril jazzed up decaf starbucks caffe verona coffee people black tiger starbucks house blend starbucks breakfast blend starbucks sumatra wolfgang puck french roast green mountain lake and lodge green mountain french roast caribou mahogony wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya emeril big easy bold ,nice flavor , good but not great
this coffee has a good flavor and a good strength at first it seemed strong but then i got use to it i recommend this flavor coffee good wake up in the morning ,delicious , good coffee
very nice smooth cup of coffee caribou coffee has been a favorite of mine since the first time i visited and had the opportunity to go to a store and have coffee i have since done mail order for their coffee and after purchasing a keurig coffee machine was happy to see it was available in k cups i also enjoy the caribou blend but i have to say this blend has a little more kick to it but still a smooth coffee with no after taste ,up , good coffee
i had not tried caribou brand k cups before and am extremely picky i like a rich intense well bodied coffee and this product delivered strong but no bitter taste when brewed with oz water i would recommend this product to anyone with similar tastes and will definitely buy it again ,rich and delicious , very good coffee
this is one of my favorites it is smooth and rich and not too strong for morning but also bold enough that if i like a cup in the afternoon it will do for that too my only problem is that i can never find it locally i almost always have to get it online which is usually more expensive i have tried the as a substitute and i do not like that one quite as much as the mahogany ,like it but hard to find , good but not great
this is probably my favorite k cup so far i am no professional taster so talk of flavor notes in coffee or elsewhere usually leaves me scratching my head and thinking if you say so but at my first sip of this dark smooth coffee i though chocolate it is not flavored or sweet but for me it has a note of good dark chocolate highly recommended if you like your coffee strong and full of flavor ,first chocolate , good coffee but not a great price
very smooth rich flavor even on the largest setting dark blend a very satisfying cup of coffee i will recommend this to my friends this product arrived on time well packaged ,caribou coffee mahogany , good coffee
obviously taste is an opinion but in my opinion this is the best coffee out there for keurig and i have tried a i love dark roast but starbucks french roast sumatra and others i cannot remember off hand seem to taste stale to me or not as bold cannot stand any of caribou other dark roasts such as which you can get at target sometimes all in all i am hoping this one sticks around personal fav ,my favorite , not as good as i be
smooth full of flavor not bitter no nasty aftertaste people that like newmans extra bold starbucks verona and sumatra french roast and other dark cup should love this it is better ,love it , good coffee
on the other hand prefers an extra bold dark roast after our favorable experience with the caribou brand before we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend br br let me just say that mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor it is quite strong and dark but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts this coffee packs a powerful punch although that is not normally my thing i can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener my boyfriend adores it though and it has become a staple blend for him i will still drink this on occasion but it is a bit too potent for me br br i think this is the best dark roast i have had the chance to try ,smooth and tasty and an come true for those who enjoy bold dark , good for you
nice bold taste but with a little packaged overtone like other k cup products this is just a shade below fresh ,not like fresh but better , good but not great
got this in a k cup sampler the best k cup so far if you like good strong coffee with a lot of flavor slight hint of cocoa this is it no bitter after taste this one goes on top of my reorder list perfect for the k cup system the one reviewer on this post that gave it one star has no taste buds ,caribou mahogany , great coffee
my wife and i are avid keurig coffee fans with three brewers between the two of us we started out ordering all the flavored pods and soon learned than are likes were back to the we each have a couple of full strength and then go to the de caf for that last cup br br mahogany is my choice for the full blend it is smooth has an excellent taste and aroma br br we are totally satisfied with this order ,down to almost , great product
the name of this coffee is mahogany in my mind a deep rich brown the coffee flavor is deep and rich and the color is dark brown it is delicious ,coffee is good name is good , good coffee
i ordered the mahogany caribou coffee k cups and adore them i recommend this product if you like bold coffe with a smooth taste ,love caribou , great coffee
this is a serious cup of joe br i have turned at least friends onto this coffee br robust and ,yum , great coffee
this is maybe the greatest coffee ever made i have had this many time before in regular bean that i grind myself but never in k cups tastes the exact same and its maybe my favorite coffee ever ,great coffee , delicious
i like the taste of this coffee tried the other brands but got stuck on this one i also like the eco of the company ,great tasting coffee , great coffee
this is the best caribou kcup if you like a dark hearty roast with good flavor and little acidity will definitely buy again ,best caribou , great coffee
i have been drinking tully kona for the past years but with the price increase of kona i needed to find something less expensive after trying numerous kcups this mahogany is just as good as the kona with a full coffee flavor and a hint of caramel i am happily converted ,great coffee , great product
i enjoyed this because of the full taste i get out of it without it being too bold or having a burnt taste to me it is a bit above the medium blend i do take creamer with my coffee so the boldness may be down i will definitely order more of this when i am am out ,yummy coffee , not good
i could get very used to this this is a nice strong robust coffee without bitterness the k cups are so convenient and make no mess ,excellent coffee , great coffee
i really enjoy this coffee i have used a variety of the k cups and this is one of the best ,great coffee , great coffee
strong smooth flavor mahogany describes the color and the mood you get when drinking absolutely the best i have found my favorite ,fantastic stuff , great coffee
of all the coffees i have tried and i have tried a bunch this is hands down my favorite great bold taste but no bitter aftertaste i drink coffee all day and i like it strong and fresh it can be difficult to find a stronger tasting coffee that is really great without cream or sugar i drink my coffee black i have not yet found anything i like better yum ,great coffee , great coffee
too mild for me i like a strong flavor my wife likes this coffee has enough flavor and boldness to keep it enjoyable and not feeling like water coffee if you like strong bold coffee you will be disappointed for a mild coffee i found this good but not good enough to warrant the higher cost over many of the other brands br br i will not be re ordering caribou mahogany my wife prefers donut shop brand over this again not strong enough for me but still makes a good cup of coffee ,nice smooth flavor but not strong enough for me , not as good as i be
if you are a fan of full bodied coffees give this one a shot br br for my taste the vast majority of k cups are too watery and weak even on the small cup setting so i towards the extra bold varieties i had previously been enjoying newman own extra bold and gm dark magic after reading some favorable comparisons between those and mahogany i decided to give it a chance br br i find that it is slightly less bitter not that bitter is bad than newman eb or dark magic and a little smoother i also think it is more full bodied without any burned bean flavor i have tried the mahogany on the larger cup setting and actually still liked it something i have never said before ,best k cup to date , good but not great
i have sampled many different k cup coffe types i prefer a really robust coffee and mahogany really t provide that i would it as medium roast coffee with a smooth taste if that is what u are after then give this blend a try ,mahogany k cup , good coffee
no bitterness a strong full bodied cup but does not taste like smooth very drinkable if you like bold dark coffee this will please ,excellent not too smooth , good coffee
in my office and for me personally this is the smoothest and best tasting coffee you can buy for your keurig machine great price too ,best coffee , great coffee
i have tried about every k cup brand caribou is my all time go to brand flavorful yet not strong and no jitters you get the same great flavor whether you make a small cup or a large one ,my fave , great coffee
if you like a bold cup of good coffee and have a keurig single up brewer this is the flavor to buy never with mahogany ,bold k cups coffee , good coffee
i have this strong flavorful mahogany coffee by caribou in my keurig i love the taste i do like strong coffee and this seems to be the right blend of strong to medium i use a vanilla diet supplement in the coffee every morning with a splash of torani sugar free syrup and there is breakfast on the move a href http www amazon com gp product b caribou coffee mahogany k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers count a ,coffee lovers , great coffee
we love this coffee it is the best k cup we have found we like strong coffee and struggled at first to find one that we enjoyed the prices on amazon cannot be beat and the shipping super fast ,we love this coffee , great coffee
my husband enjoyed this coffee we usually use newman extra bold but thought we br would try something different it was a bit too strong for me i prefer newman but it was br still good ,a bit too strong for me , not as good as it is
this coffee is but not strong enough for my tastes i do use cream and i am sure that makes a difference ,not my cup of coffee , good coffee
i like strong coffee but i do not want it to taste burnt or have an acidic after taste caribou coffee mahogany is full bodied with a nice balance of dark notes and acidity it is one of my go to coffees when my favorites like coffee people wake up call are out of stock ,nice taste , good coffee
i like my coffee strong this is the first brand that i have tasted that provides the kick i need without the bitterness i keep my pantry stocked with mahogony and i do not share ,great taste not bitter , not as good as it is
love to order my coffee on amazon easy and shows up quickly br this k cup is great coffee is very good as well ,caribou , great coffee
one of the richer coffee for k cups we typically grind our own even for the keurig but the from caribou is a great alternative order was shipped very quickly will definitely buy again ,mahogany k cups , great coffee
this is my favorite k cup coffee i ve tried about twenty different types and so far everyone i have served it to really likes it a lot even the coffee connoisseur i know thought this k cup made an excellent cup of coffee two non coffee drinking friends wish they liked coffee because they love the sound of caribou mahogany ,up to its name , great coffee
this is a great coffee its dark but not bitter a little chocolaty and it reminds me of an lodge i can get them for a better price in a caribou coffee store however ,yum , great coffee
i have tried quite a few coffees and many end up tasting the same however this and the italian blend by timothy are two that are very good black or with cream sugar if you are looking for a simple coffee without all the flavors this is the one for you ,great simple coffee , not as good as it is
i have tried over a dozen varieties of k cups and this is by far my favorite it is strong but not bitter and just has a great flavor this will be my choice from now on ,i love caribou mahogany , great coffee
without it to death if you like a full bodied but mellow brew this might be for you it is hearty but not at all bitter it holds a nice full body even when the keurig is set to the setting it is now my favorite blend ,mellow full , not as good as it is
so far this is the only k cup i have found thats tastes great with a normal brew it is not watered down like the regular stuff and t taste burnt like the bold stuff they only k cup i am buying from now on ,best k cup out there , great taste
we have tried every coffee brand available for the keurig and this one is by far the best it is smooth and rich the closest to starbucks if that is your thing i add to it a healthy splash of coffee mocha very good ,really excellent , great coffee
the mahogany has a smooth full bodied character i highly recommend this coffee to drinkers looking for a bold but not overpowering taste ,caribou coffee mahogany review , good coffee
this coffee is not really bold in my opinion it falls more along medium roast flavor it is a decent smooth coffee but i did not think really bold like all k cups though seriously overpriced ,good coffee , good coffee
if you like strong coffee as i do this coffee is over rated i found it weak with a sickening after taste ,disapointed , not as good as
this coffee is very full bodied and has a great aroma however it is the only k cup coffee i have had that has a bitter aftertaste i would still drink it if someone offered me a cup but i will not buy it again ,full but bitter , good coffee
this was sold out at cafe express site thrilled to br find it here quick delivery and great service happy to know that i can find it here ,best coffee , great product
my favorite blend of my favorite coffee used to have to a few pounds of the stuff back in my everytime i went out to the now i can get in k cups yay good price on amazon but super saver shipping takes forever it to the post office makes no sense just it to me and days off the wait already ,best coffee ever , great coffee
this coffee is very smooth but rather flat compared to starbuck brews it does not have any bite to it br if you like a mild coffee you will enjoy this one ,smooth but , good coffee
honestly i am not sure why so many folks like this coffee in their reviews it is a little weak but mostly just does not have a rich flavor it is really missing something i drink coffee black maybe it tastes better with cream and sugar before buying this coffee i had been drinking starbuck french roast and folger black silk both of which taste so much better than this coffee ,did not like it , not as good as it is
let me be honest i was not expecting this to be very good i received a sample and it sat in the fridge for a good week before i was enough to give it a taste br br at first sip it was much sweeter than i expected it to be i could certainly taste the pineapple but the coconut flavor was much more pronounced than i thought it would be it was good i very much enjoyed the taste of the drink it was exotic and refreshing it was much fuller in weight as i was thinking it would be watery with a mild flavor br br the box reminded me of those chocolate milks that i buy for my kids but it did not from the flavor ,sweet but not too sweet , not as good as it is
i have been buying one coconut water with a splash of pineapple regularly for awhile now i like the flavor and ordering it on line is very convenient also i have had no problems with delivery br br unfortunately has just lost my business i did not mind paying for a case of i will not however pay for a case of that is robbery i can walk into grocery and buy a case of for plus there are other sites still selling it for per case i noticed is still selling the other flavors of one coconut water for for a case of so what on earth are they thinking br br i am quite unhappy with having to trust one of these other sites with my credit card information but i am willing to do that versus paying nearly for a case of quite ridiculous ,o n e coconut water with a of pineapple , the best coconut water i have ever had
but it is an airport what can you do by that point i was so wanting to try it i said sure after all it would have been for a sticky sweet soda br i was so happy with it that i kept the empty tetra pack with me the whole time i so i would know which one it was it does not taste heavy in case the pina colada reference made it sound that way but the pineapple takes the edge off the green coconut water it is amazing br i was happy to find it on amazon as i am definitely hooked br since i have prime shipping it gets to me in days if i order it right that is which saves me a trip to various local stores trying to see who still has it in stock br i m totally thrilled with this stuff ,if you are looking for something a little more this is it , not as good as it is
we loved this product and i just received my new order i noticed the packing changed which made me check the label the ingredients and nutritional information has changed br br old ingredients nutrition sample br natural coconut water br natural pineapple juice br cane juice br vit c br natural fruit flavor br sodium mg br potassium mg br sugar g br vit c br calcium br iron br br new ingredients nutrition sample br coconut water br pineapple juice br sugar br ascorbic acid br natural flavor br sodium mg br potassium mg br sugar g br calcium br iron br magnesium br vit c br juice br br maybe the new box is as it says juice and the packaging clearly says a splash of pineapple and other natural flavors br br no thank you i ll be my subscription i do not why the change ,beware ingredients have changed , a great product
please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product we just cancelled our subscription of cases per month because the new formula is disgusting not buying again unless the change back to the old version ,new for is not good at all , great product
o n e coconut water is delicious and refreshing it is amazing how it me of cramps in my and lower back ,delicious and refreshing , great product
this drink is perfect for the summer it is a healthy alternative to soda and a great way to hydrate your body i know this is not the healthiest coconut water on the market it does have cane sugar but it is the best one for those who are new to coconut water or just do not prefer something as natural as pure coconut water my brother hates coconut water but loves this stuff this drink is not too sweet and has the perfect balance of pineapple and natural coconut water mixed together i like vita coco fruit infused waters as well but find that this drink is a lot smoother in texture and slightly more refreshing on a hot summer day ,love this stuff , best water ever
i happen to like foods that as sweet as kool aid or other sugary drinks very refreshing after the lawn and helped keep those afternoon headaches away ,great taste not too sweet very refreshing , great taste
i got the o n e coconut water w splash of pineapple it is delicious not the least bit sweet just very refreshing love it and will continue using it saw this on dr oz as he recommended it ,o n e coconut water , great product
item in my local grocery store and i thought i would give it a try br br i have to admit i was very surprised about how much i enjoyed this item i found it refreshing and i felt that i had a bit more energy i would happily purchase this product again and again br br a word of advice to people complaining that it does not taste coconutty enough coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things coconut water comes from a green coconut while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut a hard brown fiber covered shell just like a green banana and a ripe banana taste different the same can be said of coconut if you do not think of this as a coconut drink or a pina colada you will probably enjoy it even more ,very tasty , good but not as good as it is
this is the best drink out there i have always had adult and no matter what i took or what the prescribed for me it has always been so difficult to treat my i started drinking coconut water for the electrolyte benefits after my intense but i noticed within several weeks that my face started to clear up and actually looked smoother besides keeping me hydrated and my electrolytes in balance it has improved the quality of my skin tone love it ,the best drink on earth , best ever
i started drinking coconut water when it was suggested to me by a friend i never really loved the taste of it but i spend a great deal of time in the desert and i just cannot seem to suck down enough water without getting so i was excited when i found flavors i know that recently it is become trendy and much harder for me to find but my friends have been drinking it for years as has my and they highly recommend it for drinking not only for sports but also to keep hydrated plus it is done wonders for my always dry skin br br if nothing else it is a great avoid a cure if drunk before going to bed and if your too much to avoid being sick it seems to work much better than to get your electrolytes back in balance ,not a drink , great product
i admit that i fully expected to dislike this product and it with a attitude something that is this trendy cannot be any good right well i was wrong the one coconut water is refreshing delicious and just barely sweet really wonderful stuff the hint of pineapple adds a little bit of acidity that enhances the basic taste of the water i bet this would make a great summer drink too but i only had one so i did not get try that my problem now is that it is been out of stock so i cannot get more ,amazing even if it is , not as good as it is
i decided to try this although i am not a big fan of flavored waters it is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some i happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be in the mix the one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition even a splash puts it up front and center this added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some it would certainly be a good pick me up after a workout or in my case after the snow that seems to be regularly this winter in the ,good taste but not for everyone , not as good as it is
ugh i tried this as a replacement for the coconut water with pineapple that was available before in the automatic ship program this stuff is awful it is got added sugar which is not needed at all and actually makes the drink taste pretty gross never getting this stuff again and i do love coconut water in general as it is a fantastic and tastier than gatorade well usually not this stuff ,why add sugar , not as good as it is
being a ride with a club i use coconut water with its high potassium and vitamin c as an energy drink i prefer this product to that you find in ethnic markets because it has no added sugar and it has not been boiled ,coconut water , best water ever
tastes like syrup it is clean tasting according to the packaging it has five essential electrolytes more potassium than a banana no fat no cholesterol and no preservatives there is a of fiber g of protein and g of sugars i suspect most of the sugar comes from the pineapple but cane juice is one of the ingredients too the fl oz carton comes to calories br br if you sign up for subscribe save it is less than per carton actually the carton is the only thing i do not like about this drink it is sort of hard to drink directly from because there is not any air getting let in when you drink which makes a vacuum this was solved by pouring it into a glass br br this was good i will definitely get more and i highly recommend this to people who like pineapple juice ,lots of flavor but not too sweet , not bad but not as good as it is
almost gagged at first taste i have used other coconut based products water milk cooking oil etc and this is the first time i have been disappointed my teenage kids hated it my son is health food nut and drinks all the protein shakes and he could not stand it i am sure done is not the healthiest but one you try that there is no comparison in flavor tolerance ,terrible flavor , the best
i love this stuff really i do i have tried all of the flavors but i have not tried the original i have to say by far pineapple is my favorite guava is a close second who am i kidding i love them all br br despite what others say about it tasting best at room temperature i find it tastes very refreshing and even better when on ice if you want a natural tasty alternative to water this is for you ,this stuff is delicious , best ever
since i had been from a hour bug that lasted a br week i knew i was low on electrolytes i opted for this product br as some products tend to further my stomach and br acid reflux this worked out extremely well and the taste br is good i will keep it on hand from now on ,really a good product , great product
i have tried all the different brands of coconut water and o n e is my favorite and o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple is my favorite flavor i wish the price would come back down i absolutely love this stuff ,best ever , best water ever
to me this tastes more like pineapple juice than coconut there is an hint of coconut i know the water is not strongly flavored but i was not expecting so much pineapple this is tangy and sweet it is alright package is smaller but i do not think i could handle too much more of it in one sitting i am not thrilled with their unflavored coconut water it is too tangy sour to me so with the pineapple it helps cover up that for me not sure i would buy this again still in search of the one i first tried and fell in love with but so far not finding anything as light and fresh tasting ,definitely pineapple , not as good as it is
i did not expect coconut water with a splash of pineapple juice to taste quite so salty even if it does replace electrolytes so that was off putting it is not really bad especially over ice but i will not be ordering any more of it ,coconut water w a of pineapple , the best
this is good but not as good as the standard coconut water in this brand the container is smaller there is no straw and i like the taste of the plain one better it is ok ,plain is better , not as good as it is
i have had amy and coconut water yum plain in the tetra pack great the ones in the plastic bottle and some in the larger tetra packs are from concentrate blah and yuck do not get those and the ones in the glass bottles green cover cannot remember the name but pure coconut water great too br br this one with pineapple no good the added cane juice is to the natural sweetness of coconut water and pineapple juice it makes the water taste thicker and not so healthy br br i wish these brands can just stick to the name of the drinks in their ingredients i e coconut water and pineapple juice no more ,juice is on , not as good as it is
i love coconut and pineapple but i was not wild about the one coconut water with a splash of pineapple it was not bad it had a mildly coconutty though not sweet flavor but it just was not anything special it was rather bland and i had a hard time finishing it as it started to warm up since i am not a competitive athlete and do not have any great need to replenish my electrolytes i would rather just drink water ,maybe i just do not get it , not as good as it is
just throw it in your bag and go br br prior to this experience i had not heard of coconut water on the packaging it says o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple is a blend of the natural water from inside a young green coconut and sweet golden pineapple juice it has five essential electrolytes more potassium than a banana no fat no cholesterol and no preservatives who knew you could drink a green coconut and a good source of potassium being allergic to bananas it is always good to have another source br br overall i would not drink o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple by itself in the middle of winter but together with non sugary snack or in the high heat of summer i would definitely give o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple another try ,if you really like sweet , this is the best
this seems like a pretty drink it is coconut juice and it is pineapple juice with a bit of sugar and not much else br br they claim it is a good source of potassium and electrolytes br br for me it was pretty tasty granted it was also very sweet is it a health drink i do not know if i would go that far it has vitamin c and trace amounts of calcium iron but not much else other than sugar br br for what it is something sweet to sip it is pretty good ,tasty , not as good as it is
oz size not a big deal and was my fault but it is a little too small to be useful br br taste i love coconut water i love pineapple juice i love lightly flavored coconut water this tastes like none of the above the flavor is sickly sweet ingredients included added sugar and with none of the nice mellow coconut flavor of other coconut waters i have tried might as well be a processed kids drink br br alternatives while i actually prefer o n e regular unflavored coconut water over other brands the vita coco coconut water with a splash of pineapple is far superior to this one it comes in a larger package does not have added sugar has more vitamins and nutrients this one is diluted with sugar water and tastes like you are drinking it fresh on the beach this one is just not great ,smaller than size sweet taste , this is the best
i wanted to try this juice as i am a big fan of coconut flavoured products given that it claims to have a splash of pineapple i was expecting a light pina colada flavour br br on opening the package i could smell the hint of pineapple and i would say the taste of pineapple is a bit stronger than the coconut water probably because i have mostly tasted coconut milk and not water i would say this was nothing like what i expected it is not bad for thirst quenching but it was not my favourite drink in terms of taste ,not what i expected interesting taste , not as good as it is
less magnesium phosphorous and times less calcium the only this the drink does have over vitacoco is the less gram of sugar overall pay the extra price and get a better drink for your body and if you dont believe me go to the websites and check the facts below or check it out on their web site br br o n e coconut water with splash of pineapple br calories br fat br cholesterol br sodium mg br potassium mg br carbs g br fiber br sugar g br protein g br br vitamin c br calcium br magnesium br phosphorous br iron br br compared to br br vitacoco with splash of coconut br calories br fat br cholesterol br sodium mg br potassium mg br carbs g br fiber br sugar g br protein g br br vitamin c br calcium br magnesium br phosphorous br iron ,not as healthy as you would think , a little coconut water
i am usually into pineapple and coconut drinks but this drink just did not taste all that great to me the taste does not resemble anything close to a pina colada flavor and it was actually difficult to taste the pineapple or coconut in it it just tastes tangy and a little sour like water that has a bit of sugar and sour ness to it yeah not really a taste i crave i am not sure if everyone had this reaction to this drink but it just did not appeal to me i really wanted to like it though because as i said before i usually love pineapple coconut drinks ,just did not taste good to me , not as good as it is
bland i love some of the gatorade flavors some not so much this drink falls into the not so much category for me br br it is sorta sweet sorta pineapple y and also sorta bland my wife commented that it has a feel in her mouth like the glass had soap in it still i did not think it was that bad but the drink really did not appeal to me br br in the end yes this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch but as a sports drink i think i will stick with plain old gatorade it is cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving br br if going the all natural route with your juices drinks is of the this may be something to consider and bump this review to stars ,bland , not bad but not as good as it is
considering the price of the product now as to the splash of pineapple well it must not have been a very big splash because i never did taste any pineapple so what did i taste it is hard to describe it does not taste like coconut or cane sugar or any natural fruit flavor br br to be honest it tastes like water sort of like water with an odd extra flavor it is not a bad flavor or a good flavor it is just meh flavor i do not care how healthy this drink is supposed to be for it is price it should have a better flavor or just have a flavor br br and as a thirst quencher it does not equal up to gatorade or even a lemonade i feel a glass of tap water would do just as good as job to quench your thirst ,needs a , not as good as it is
result no negative but no one would choose it over drinks everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly it leaves a strange feeling in my mouth one teen said this was probably the coconut water it had a flavor and feel br br there was no straw included with the package so the opening and pouring needed the of a fork or knife it is mostly cane sugar water so why bother br br but the biggest issue is the waste coconut sugar water from what is the carbon footprint of this product and the container has recycle on it but like milk cartons it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill br br bottom line it is not that tasty being little more than sugar water and the transport and packaging waste really do not fit into a culture for me on ,pineapple flavored coconut water from there is something we really need , best water ever
this is a close second to my all time favorite jack links beef steaks which is the of beef jerky they are very similar in taste and price but the edges out this one oh so slightly still pretty awesome jerky very tender and not a hint of fat or bon ,the of beef jerky , not as good as it is
homemade diet of sojo and meat plus no medications i am extremely pleased to report he has had no gi in over months and has a point where i consider him healthy his coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he is finally at a good weight i have before and after that show a dramatic improvement much of which i credit to sojo br br it does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble but i make days worth at a time this takes me about minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after to be completely honest i am not thrilled about cooking for my dog but i am thrilled with the results if i was able to feed him raw perhaps down the road when our vet gives the ok preparation time would be almost nothing ,healthy alternative to canned or raw diets , great for my dog
sojos foods have been tested for nutritional content and they are all formulated to have a calcium to phosphorus ratio of you do not need to add calcium or phosphorus ,this food is not , great for
i feed my dogs sojos as part of a mixed bowl of quality kibble and quality canned food i recommend sojos br br but i had a problem with the amazon purchase amazon stored the sojos bag in the original box sojos sent them my order was picked from the shelf and the box containing the sojos was placed in another box and mailed to me the bag of sojos was almost one year old and there was no way amazon kept track of that i got a refund from amazon with no question and very quickly but amazon needs to keep control of the use by dates of food they offer on their site ,great food , my dog loves it
i have three so we go through a lot of food one of the dogs has had severe health issues and since we have switched from commercial kibble to home made food he is thrived he gets regular blood tests to the drugs he is on and they have been perfect since we started on sojos it will not cure his issues but he has more energy and he cannot wait for meal time the other two are glowing with health as well all three dogs coats are shiny and they have tons of energy for a ,great food , great product
i think this is a great product but my picky dog gets tired of it after a week ,great product if you are to do the work , great product
my small mixed breed is a picky eater but he seems to like so long as i mix it with some good people food he had problems digesting it delivery was prompt as expected ,likes it , great product
soaked sojos original he eats with gusto from his early days i would play with and take his food away so he is not food aggressive he eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done weston then wants to play hard train hard take a nice walk and his coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and the are nice sized and easy to clean up i just had him days ago and he ate this sojos mix with the same gusto even with the e to challenge him so i am a fan and we are finished with the second lb bag and i just ordered another one hope this helps someone with a picky eater i know another reviewer mentioned their shih tzu not liking it but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other much like us humans ,picky puppy , great product
i did not mean to order a pound bag but i did wow that is a lot of food be sure to mix it with protein or else you dog will suffer a bit of internal ,original , not as good as it is
sojo diet lacks calcium and if fed as directed will cause severe metabolic bone disease in your dog this diet requires with a balanced calcium phosphorous additive to be safe ,nutrition , not as good as it is
make great pocket stuffers to carry around for incentive and my old guy has a hard time waking up to go outside and one of one of these bones does i have a younger who also loves the bones but she does not need much to do anything ha but they are also great training aids i also sent home a handful of these bones with a i had at my home for his dogs and he said they loved them too so i guess that is but that is dogs that really love the things oh the bones are way more expensive when you find them at your vet about twice as much per pound so this is a great buy buy a nice food safe container from home and fill it up you will not run out of bones for a while and that is a good thing ,my dogs are wild about these treats , great product
it does not have a whole lot of flavor but most light roasts don t it does have a unique flavor but is kind of rich and so i recommend you mix it with other coffees to make it taste better and make you other bland coffees taste a little better ,it is ok for something different , not as good as it is
it seems most of the organic shade grown fair trade coffee is medium or dark roasted so i have been having a hard time finding something that i like while this does not wow me like some other coffees it is priced cheaper than those coffees and it is a good brew for when i am not really paying attention to what i am drinking like when i am working br br i m definitely going to keep this one around and just switch to the expensive better coffees that i have found when i can really enjoy them br br compared to other coffee that is not organic shade grown fair trade this is an average light roast good but nothing to get excited over it is worth purchasing over those coffees because of the growing practices ,decent light roast organic , good coffee but not a great price
i recently moved and could not find a thai restaurant nearby my favorite meal at my old thai place was curry i used the recipe on the back on the package when i got it and it was just like what i get at the restaurant excellent flavor ,just like the , great product
we love to get curry at our local thai restaurant but i have not been able to find a paste that actually tastes like it this paste does and is very easy to prepare just add some coconut milk and heat add your protein and veggies of choice done i have now bought some of the other mae ploy products and found them all very good quality with authentic flavors ,authentic taste easy to , great product
this is really delicious and not something you can find in the local grocery store if you did it would be very expensive and a much smaller quantity this is a good deal and super easy to use ,good value good taste , delicious
this paste is actually what first got me into thai curry at the time i loved it made it all the time then i discovered a better brand of curry paste hand brand curry paste premium stuff amazon does not sell hint to amazon stock it but you can get it at its based in seattle and they import everything from thailand the flavor of hands brand is so much better the mae ploy a huge difference i went back to mae ploy after having hand brand and i didnt even finish my meal very bland boring by comparison also as a side note these are very small containers i was used to buy the large ones at my local asian store these are like the size of those ones not a good deal if you can find it locally ,better curry paste out there , not as good as i be
i ordered this product to send to my friend husband they had just moved to in the end of march she could not find any diet peach snapple that tasted the same as what they had bought up here in new jersey he said that the water that was used down south made the diet peach snapple taste different so now she is happy because she has found a source that they can buy his snapple from thank you ,diet delivered , not as good as it is
chilled and it has a mild but not overwhelming peach flavor to it that is just right snapple makes this with green and black tea leaves there is also a mild green tea flavor mixed in with the peach flavoring they use filtered water as well this tea is sweetened somewhat with aspartame but snapple adds in just the right amount so that it is not excessively sweet if you want really tea that is rather sweet you will either have to look further or use this with added sweetener it also contains and it is kosher if these are dietary concerns for you br br if you have other questions the company has a toll free number so that people can contact them br br overall this tea is perfect for a hot summer day when you want something cool to yourself and your i highly recommend this product ,it a diet , not as good as it is
previously i bought some mustard seed that was bitter but the mustard i made with this seed is very tasty and after a few days not bitter at all pleasantly spicy ,good quality for a good price , good but not great
in my quest to find snacks that are not empty calorie types this is one of my new favorites great taste and although a hefty calorie count the decent amount of protein makes this a good choice for eating on the run if a real meal just is not an option very satisfying i also tried the white sesame crunch and that is ok too but this one wins for taste ,good stuff , delicious
mrs may pumpkin crunch is a great snack for those of you watching calories and intake be aware that the oz portions are two servings most of mrs may products are great but with the fat at g per serving i find it is not a complete guilt free snack however the pumpkin seed crunch has of protein per serving vs the usual in their other snacks so if you are monitoring your intake and want to indulge in these now and then the pumpkin seed crunch is the healthiest option of the bunch br br that said they are all tasty and certainly not bad for you just a little high in fat if you are watching your weight ,in protein , delicious
i love to put a bag of pumpkin crunch on the table at work and watch people faces light up when they taste them try it ,yummy , great taste
mrs may pumpkin crunch is the best of the bunch if you like pumpkin seeds this is for you the slightly sweet cubes make me think i am eating cake these are great for snacking and even dessert a truly wonderful product and gluten free into the bargain ,mrs may pumpkin crunch is terrific , delicious
a href http www amazon com gp product b mrs may dry roasted snack pumpkin crunch ounce pouches pack of a br pumpkin crunch is great br stick with oz size servings br much too easy to consume entire oz bag without realizing it br d lol ,tasty and light , delicious
it has good tast and crunchy i bought black sesame before it is good too highly ,good snack for everyone , good
i picked this up at my local grocery store in the seasonal aisle with the easter goodies br br this moist cake mix can be made with or without eggs i used them and was not the least bit disappointed br br i paired the cake with pink lemonade frosting too but you could have it totally un if you would like you will still love it br br perfect for the family dessert children cupcakes or a lovely addition to the ladies afternoon tea if you love pink lemonade you are going to love this br br the color just screams spring and easter and the taste will leave you screaming for another bite br br i give this stars and my thumbs up ,i want more , not as good as i be
i normally bake from scratch but when i saw this pink lemonade cake mix with frosting i just had to try them both this cake can be made two ways with or without egg i recommend with as the cake will be nice and moist as a result this cake would also be just as good with plain white icing or just a of powdered sugar you can make it as a layer or sheet cake or as cupcakes i picked it up at the grocery store recently for about per box the frosting was about the same price per can i ended up going back and purchasing more for later as i believe this is just a seasonal flavor and pillsbury will pull it from the market at some point if they do i hope they bring it back every spring until then i will be stocking up ,addictive , not as good as it is
like i said about the icing i am so happy to be able to buy this online it is a family favorite it also was shipped on time and arrived early definitely going to buy again ,yum , great product
i picked up a box of this in a discount grocery store in the cake was heavenly i liked it so much i found another store that sold the mix as well as the icing and there is even a pink lemonade cookie mix which i bought but have not tried yet br br the taste is of course lemon but it reminds me a bit of that flavored mix country time i drank as a kid but less tangy its very light and refreshing br br i simply loved it hope this is more than just a seasonal flavor ,tasty , not as good as it is
i tried the cookies and they were great nd trying to find them in the stores br with no success did not realize they were seasonal or would have stocked up br great product ,good , great snack
this is a great product so it is no surprise that the local shelves are often cleared of it especially early in the season purchasing in bulk through amazon com is a dependable alternative bayer in in form feeds roses and flowers while protecting them with a systemic for up to weeks but you will need a separate disease treatment and the systemic would not be something one would apply to anything edible bayer me the product is safe for and ,food , great product
i have been a rose for many years i remember when this product was made by and called rose this product really helps with the and that roses tend to acquire though it does not stop all cane it stops the major ones that cause serious damage and spread disease i treat all my plants on the same monthly and make sure to do it every four to six weeks making a note on my like one other reviewer said you will not see immediate results with this since it is systemic for the best results make sure to read the package and work the granules into the soil and water in ,easy care and great product , great product
as it is made by a international brand i thought a systemic product might work br a week after the first application there was no reduction in but by the second week i started to notice less less of the little by the time i was ready to do a third application there was not even one white fly or any other insect on any of my roses or any other i had even used it on potted plants which were also it worked on everything br remember the product is systemic and is absorbed gradually into the plant so you will not see an immediate improvement but it works wonderfully also if like me you do not always remember to spray regularly or get the of the leaves then something which you can sprinkle at the base of the plant every weeks is certainly a lot easier to use ,excellent product , not as good as i be
there is one important thing not mentioned on their label and that it is not for use in containers why hide that info to make more sales of course you will only learn that if you read their q a on their website i the labels and opened the back label and it is never mentioned you cannot use it on potted plants thanks bayer now i have to go back to the store to return it i guess a lot of people have wondered why their potted flowers or roses died not knowing it is because of this product if you see your bees and disappear then this is the reason will systemic products affect your fragrance of your flowers after years of use they will not have a fragrance got you would not know unless you thoroughly dug through your dirt avoid this ,misleading product if you want no then use it , not as good as it is
the active ingredient in this is it is by the rose plant into the leaves but not the flowers i learned recently online i have been using this stuff for years and this but put it down to my not giving the plant enough granules unless you spray the flowers with another product containing the the japanese devour the rose flowers and leave th leaves alone br see link br ,good for the leaves not for the , not as good as it is
works wonderfully for most all in the garden could not be easier since it is systemic and helps only what you want to ,a must for the , great product
if i could give this product a minus stars i would there is now very strong evidence that which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is and contributing to disorder this us has yet to ban this pesticide but it has already been banned in other countries avoid this product and any others containing ,like the contains product , not as good as it is
these chips are good to sprinkle on salad use in cookies and baking and sprinkle on cereal very pleased ,chips , great chips
this is the best mustard my husband loves it on his sandwiches for work it has the right spices and taste to enhance what you are eating have been looking for it in bigger tubes with not much luck but any size is great ,hot mustard , great
this is the best i have ever eaten if you like mustard and you like br horseradish this is the product to try br my first experience with was several years ago when my son lived br in germany he used to send it home but after he moved back to the br states the supply was cut off but when you notified me that it was br available i was ecstatic br the blend is delicious and goes well with your favorite crackers and br cheese or with anything you enjoy with mustard it adds br that little zing br give it a try you will not be sorry ,mustard , best ever
there is not much to say about this mustard other than ummm ummm good i tried this for the first time at a bbq on a salmon burger and it truly brought the flavor out of the meat now i use it on everything from chicken burgers to homemade dressing you will love it ,good , good stuff
great with breakfast sausages cheddar cheese sandwiches etc even though it is a bit exotic expensive to use with sandwiches where it tends to fade into the background it is best to keep it simple and let it stand out ,best mustard ever , great product
it arrived on time and was packaged well this was my first try of this mustard it was unique similar to many other hot but i it over the others i have because of the balance of flavors it is almost as hot as english mustard but a little sweeter and maybe a slight vinegar essence in it the tube and a bag of pretzels lasted me one or two evenings ,hot , not as good as it is
we became with this mustard when we were in and really enjoyed it that was our reason for purchasing it great find we have liked this as much as the one that we bought in europe ,super mustard , great product
the lobster bisque is absolutely delicious nice lobster flavor i cannot imagine what you could possibly add to improve the taste of this soup just open heat and enjoy i have become such a fan of the baxter line that i cannot wait to try them all ,wonderful , great taste
soups are usually very nice but the lobster bisque is especially good it tastes authentic it has a good flavour is creamy and has just enough lobster bits to make it interesting add some fresh black pepper and a dash of brandy or and it soup served in a very good restaurant br br it also surprisingly low calorie though the nutrition info here says calories for oz the label actually says calories so even if you ate the whole can for lunch you would consume only about calories ,delicious low treat , not as good as it is
no doubt about it this is just the right combination of lobster with a hint of dry white wine a dash of brandy finish this soup to perfection br ingredients br water lobster cod concentrated tomato paste modified white wine milk powder double cream salt yeast extract sugar shrimp powder fish powder vegetable oil vegetable extracts brandy concentrated lemon juice spices herb and spice extracts with celery br no artificial br no artificial flavours br no artificial preservatives br br information br gluten free br contains milk fish shellfish celery ,awesome fresh tasting soup perfect just out of can heat an serve , not as good as it is
the taste is good but i found myself biting down on small bits of lobster shells more often than acceptable this made me not want to finish my bowl of soup ,tastes ok but has of , good
this soup is very good tasting if you like seafood like i do i am finally finishing my case of cans because it is good food however i do not plan on getting any more of this particular product because every can has a little something extra bits and pieces of shell mostly from the shrimp but also a few hard pieces now and then from the lobster they are small pieces which means taking small spoonfuls and not biting down hard on anything and do not eat the last spoonful i find six to eight pieces of this in each can like i said before i am finishing the case because it is food and pretty good at that but i just do not appreciate having to be that careful with my soup ,ingredient of , not as good as i be
it is ok soup but i expected more as i love lobster bisque and tried so many different kinds in different places this one is very watery and i could not find any lobster there i guess it is ok for the price but i would never buy this brand of the lobster bisque again ,too watery , not as good as it is
this was actually a gift to my daughter along with cases of other baxter soups she is of the opinion that baxter is absolutely the best canned soup on the planet of the soups she is tasted which include the major american brands she does not cook much the lobster bisque rated just below baxter scottish smoked salmon which she rated the best ever from my own perspective and usually cooking my own food i have to admit that the baxter soup line for canned soup is superior ,canned , best ever
for canned soup it hits the spot decently there is definitely some lobster flavor and small chunks in it however the whole thing tastes a little on the fishy side if i was served this in a i think i would walk out ,it is good for canned soup , not as good as it is
i gave this product a one because zero was not an option this is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish in it the only lobster in the soup was some shell it was salty fishy nasty and inedible not only that but of the cans were dented a complete waste of money beyond disappointing it made me angry ,disgusting nasty , not as good as it is
this soup is pretty good not great i put some heavy cream oz and some tabasco in it i have had a lot better lobster bisque but at a much higher price ,pretty good , great taste
as someone who lives and by seafood i have had my fair share of lobster bisque this stuff while not completely horrible needs some love before it is decent the texture is not quite there not thin enough to be soup but not up to bisque level either as for the taste it is rather bad a little on the bland side as a i for the one thing that fixes all things seafood old bay dumped in a amount and stirred while still on the heat the old bay added a nice taste that made it tolerable to eat doubt i will be purchasing this brand again though ,i have had but i have had better too , not as good as it is
as far as canned soups go this is ok i was disappointed with the texture extra unexpected bits shell pieces and overall quality having been spoiled by living in maine for years before to the south i tried different brands of canned bisque i have come to the that lobster bisque is best when made fresh ,as far as canned go , not as good as it is
this is one of the worse tasting soups i have ever eaten i hated it and now i have a full case it tastes bitter to me and my husband would not even try it only my cat was trying to reach it on the counter ,bad tasting soup , not as good as it is
i advise you to do your own web search to determine how the health risk could affect you the as the lobster liver and however even in the cold scottish waters and other harmful agents have been present and there are for the general public i was disappointed to discover this information so i only ordered the mushroom and seafood flavors ,health , not as good as it is
in europe you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a breakfast buffet a great source of omega oil you can improve your health by eating these tasty nutty seeds they are good for the and good for the heart br br the golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut brown seeds they look nice in baked goods like lighter breads they taste the same as the dark seeds ground they do not show up in white bread so you can some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber br br we like them sprinkled on oatmeal muesli or yogurt ,lovely seeds for your cereal baking or , great for the price
i have been taking flaxseeds for several years due to the health benefits i was excited to see such a great price on these from a company these are the best tasting flaxseeds i have ever had to get the maximum health benefits you have to finely grind them in a standard coffee grinder we usually grind tablespoons per person twice a day and then add them to lemonade crystal light or tea and drink it down quick before it flaxseeds are loaded with minerals vitamins amino acids and fiber they are excellent for weight loss and work well for chronic constipation there are several web sites out there that can tout the health benefits of flaxseeds but unfortunately it is against the review guidelines to post links so i will just suggest to those of you wanting more information to search google ,the best i have ever had , best tea ever
flaxseed is a great way to get fiber in your diet and this brand delivers it has a mild taste i put tablespoons in my morning smoothie and gives you of your daily fiber required intake flaxseed also contain omega so you also place a of nutrients in your diet with this little seed br br an excellent source of protein fiber and minerals such as magnesium and copper how can you go wrong ,and rich , great product
it is best to buy flaxseeds as opposed to flaxseed oil or meal because you get more omega since you are grinding the seeds yourself the released omega oils are at their br br i recommend storing these flaxseeds in the freezer you can keep them there after you open them as well i grind tablespoons in a coffee grinder and then add it to yogurt or a protein shake good stuff ,great for , great product
bob red mill organic golden flaxseeds are an excellent way to ingest some omega ounces are delivered in packs and if you do not use it all immediately i suggest storing the seeds in the freezer to keep them fresh grind them right before you use them and they have a mild taste milder than brown flaxseed i have ordered this product several times and the quality has been consistently high ,organic i , delicious
good product but remember that you need some way of grinding because apparently we cannot digest whole flaxseeds ,good product , good
this is funny i bought the flax seed to make a neck warmer i made said to use flax seed and warm in microwave for minutes bought bags only needed so decided to make use of the rest grind and put over any food the are great br i put mine in and cereal will keep after this last bag will be again ,great on , not as good as it is
i enjoy this flaxseed in everything i have tried it in so far this product has a pleasant flavor yet does not over power the foods i put it in it helps to keep my digestive track regular i ground it in my coffee grinder and just sprinkle it on just about everything my husband and i love it in pancakes i enjoy it in my cereals and even on ice cream i especially like it mixed in my yogurt i highly recommend this product ,good in almost , great for the price
i ordered this flaxseed after reading how good ground flaxseed was for you i ordered a grinder both were reasonably priced and the grinding was so easily i have been using flaxseed daily since that time and the claims made on the internet have proven to be true the product arrived on time and in great shape i have purchased from this vendor several times and have not been disappointed ,so good for you , good but not great
i have recently started drinking green smoothies to get healthier and had read that flax seeds have terrific health benefits such as lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol i add a tablespoon of chia seed and flax seed to my smoothies every day and since drinking my fruits and vegetables i feel better lost some weight and have stopped having heart i am now looking forward to having my next blood work done to see how well it has helped highly recommend to anyone wanting to get healthy an all natural way ,healthy goodness , great for
bought this as a way to take in omega nutrient the pack of has lasted me almost a year you have to grind up the seeds and freeze the rest no complaints very reasonable pricing ,great stuff , great product
we are very happy with these organic golden flaxseeds we grind them and put them in so many things plus they make a great topping for yogurt and cereal in the whole seed form these are now a staple in our house ,very happy with this purchase , great for
i have very little to say about the product except that it is a great product and their delivery subscription works very well ,great and delivery service , great product
great for you grind them up and add a few tablespoons cannot tell it is there in your cereal ect ,very healthy , great product
i have bought ground flax in the store there was always a rancid aftertaste this is the best tasting flax i have ever had but i have to throw it in the coffee grinder and then pick out little rocks that are barely bigger than the seeds i found this out the hard way after using the seeds whole nothing like working a bite trying to find where the rock you just bit is br br after you grind the powder and black stones will be evident i have about per quarter cup of ground mixture perhaps this is something you organic are used to i am not br br i have only used bag so far so i cannot comment on whether or not the stones are in the others but i highly doubt it was a fluke bag ,it would be a if it were not for the rocks , not as good as it is
this brand always makes good products since you buy bulk they turn out to be quite cheaper than in the supermarket very clean flaxseeds i add it to my smoothies to bath my joints with some natural raw supposedly they are better if eaten sprouted though have not tried it ,red mill did it again , great product
these flaxseeds are of good quality i eat them daily bought the whole seed rather than the ground seed because of the better nutritional value of grinding your own will buy again i read that whole seeds can pass and that ground seeds can loose their nutritional value over time so we grind a week worth at a time best used in oatmeal as the flavors blend well or in a cold cereal or added to a cup of coffee for a twist seem to blend better in hot foods ,they are good seeds , not as good as it is
i was not thrilled because i had to pick out tiny bits of the flax seeds themselves were fine top quality if it were not for the bits that get through the w the seeds i guess this would get stars ,good seeds but , not as good as it is
it is also a routine baking ingredient i put it into my bread along with sunflower seeds and organic wheat flour i also put it into my smoothie stir fry dishes anything you can think of good price and really it is a must have for a healthy diet ,a must have for healthy life , great product
looks fresh and clean i have roasted it in the toaster oven and i also use it in food whole or ground up in the coffee grinder ,good stuff , great product
these are excellent quality flaxseeds i just toasted them a little on a pan and even that made a great snack i also powdered them in a coffee grinder after them a little and the powder is delicious too delicious nutritious awesome planning to have it in my cereal tomorrow and maybe sprinkle some on my veggies i think i will also try out bob quinoa and ,excellent quality , great taste
this is the nd order i have placed for bob red mill organic flaxseed it is a good quality whole flaxseed we grind it a little at a time and sprinkle it on cereal and in yogurt it keeps a long time in the freezer i have been using this flaxseed for about a year now eating a tablespoon about every day and have noticed that my skin is softer plus it keeps me regular if ya know what i mean flaxseed is also a good way to get in some of the omega that the body needs ,bob red mill organic , great product
it was my mistake i thought there were bags rather than so the price per bag is much higher than what i pay at the local grocery for the same product ,a little expensive , not as good as it
the flax seed is packaged in separate smaller packages so that it can stay fresher longer and it was recommended by the flax cookbook i purchased this seed was cheaper than other brands i had checked on i am putting it away for any emergency that may arise ,recommended brand , good but not great
i bought this before i realized how much i was getting and before i knew they had it at the grocery store that was my own fault i really should have waited but the seeds are great i just have way too many in my freezer ,the product is fine , good
i hope that this is really as nutritious as the claims i chew on this like the and and it gets stuck on my br br these seeds were easier going down when sprinkled on top of crab and egg fried rice go figure br br i incorporated a cup into the regular white loaf recipe from the and found that the addition meant more warm water was needed to hydrate the dough and i did not get much of a rise so i baked the loaf with tin foil over the loaf pan and the bread rose to its usual height since white bread is not that healthy i will include flax seed ground in my food processor to the ill effects ,it is , great product
given the recent issues with products made in china i have decided to not buy any food products from there so i will not be buying anymore of this snack if they ever switch to made in the u s i will buy it again as i did like it ,tastes great but says made in china so i will not buy it again , great product
this product is made in china i would not believe any claims they make regarding allergy safety and vegan kosher considering mrs may markets itself as a healthy product i was shocked when i at the back and noticed this product was made in china china has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices toys dog food and now we are supposed to trust them making our health food br br not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world i will not buy this product anymore ,health food from china , not as good as the dog
these are wonderfully crunchy and delicious the calorie count is misleading however one piece is more than the calories they claim it is but it is worth it ,delicious , great snack
if you like nuts and you are looking for a healthy great tasting snack you cannot go wrong with almond crunch my husband and i recently eliminated high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated soybean oil from our diet and we feel so much better trying to find tasty snacks that do not contain these products is not easy so we were thrilled to find mrs mays naturals we love the cashew crunch as well ,great taste without high corn syrup , great snack
i am a little shocked that this so called health food product is made from chinese grown ingredients i would be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is also keep in mind that chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other food products all the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the united states why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price your purchasing choice does make a difference let us stop expecting and to take care of our safety and economy they never will we can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well being make purchase ,what is the of this product , not as good as you are
the nuts used tasted very fresh the bite sized chunks were just right it is lightly sweetened but not too sweet very satisfying ,fantastic , the best
for when the last review was written which looks like but i am looking at the back of a bag of almond crunch and it clearly says that the product is made in california not china so if that was the main back then it is no longer an issue i just discovered this snack and as a person who cannot eat either gluten soy or dairy i am thrilled to find a snack i can eat first of all and a snack i can eat that is actually tasty even better i have been eating these for a few days now and no adverse reactions and i have an extremely sensitive stomach i plan on trying out all the flavors to figure out which ones i like the best but yeah i would highly recommend this product to those on restricted diets and even to those who aren t ,product not made in china , not as good as i be
i am known to be nuts for nuts and i have tried nuts from around the world as friends bring them back for me as gifts very near the top of the list of the best nut snacks is mrs may almond crunch from the first time i tasted it to every time i eat it now i am amazed at the quality of the almonds lightly sweetened glaze which is very like attention to in the ingredients etc as a side note because of how much i was impressed by this product i went on a tasting by buying about different kinds of mrs may products from the peanut and cashew to the various sesame etc perhaps i am biased to the original but none of the others have that same magic i would rate the rest as stars but the almond crunch should get stars ,the best of the best nut snacks i have ever had , the best i have ever had
these are fresh crunchy natural and healthy snacks you can reseal and keep in the car crumble into non fat yogurt or over salads or pack some in the kids lunch convenient and delicious ,mrs almond crunch , great snack
based on other amazon reviews i tried this product the first shipment was great delicious thought i would found my new healthful snack nd shipment was a concern and disappointment even thought of calling the company but i didn t several different packages had incredibly hard pieces of was not sure they were almonds became concerned i would chip a tooth so i have not ordered any more ,but quality seems to be , not as good as it is
delicious healthy plus amazon is cheaper than if you buy them from mrs mays actual website ,delicious , delicious
love these snacks they are a little bit sweet loads of crunchy almonds am looking forward to trying the other varieties too ,sweet , great snack
been no evidence that mrs mays keeps its workers in despite the i am sure the individual find these valuable and ships produce th the carbon per pound mile of meaning a miles by ship is as bad as miles by truck br br i really like the snack and i would give it five stars but i am one star i think it is deceptive that it was so hard to find out the snack was made in china i do not have a problem with the snack origin but mrs mays should be more with their customers and let them make the decision themselves granted most of us americans are to flip out at the latest scare of the week but that should be our choice to make br br oh and the snack itself it is quite tasty filling and healthy i will continue to purchase it ,made in china but i still enjoy it , good but not as good as i like
mrs may should inform their customers where exactly their products are made and take a stand i will not be buying any more of her products until further notice no matter how yummy they are do no harm and quality control is a concept not understood in china totally what they are getting away with ,made in china , not as good as it is
my husband has diabetes and has to watch what he eats this is a great and healthy treat for him i could not find it at local stores and was happy to see it available on amazon ,great snack , great for
to be a recovery program but the good side is that a mrs mays addiction is healthy i already have a stack of boxes in the garage so i will not run out and here i am more in case of br br almonds have always been my staff of life raw roasted dry roasted flavored and of course mrs mays i rarely have a day without them i even feed them to the a bird guy told me they were the healthiest and the bird goes nuts for mrs mays br br these are dare i say miracle nuts one taste and i was hooked how she can pack all that goodness into such a tasty snack with such healthy ingredients is a miracle if you are tired of bland gotta eat it because its healthy snacks from the nutrition store try these for a pleasant br br mike ,mrs , not as good as i like the
we are typical americans who know we should eat better but often do not because health food is usually expensive and frankly does not taste that good that is why we are so thankful to have found mrs may products they are all very healthy and quite tasty and ordering them from amazon keeps the cost down my son a golfer and i am always looking for portable healthy snacks for him to tuck in his golf bag mrs may products fit the bill nicely ,love mrs may products , great snack
my family and i love almond crunch they are just sweet enough very crunchy and a perfect snack ,delicious addictive and healthy too , delicious
i have the almond crunch and is delicious and healthy snack better than chips try it you will agree ,delicious healthy snack , delicious
this product is excellent it is also a nut snack that my wife who has celiac disease and is allergic to wheat and can enjoy i however can eat anything and this is the tastiest and most unique nut snack i have ever tried al virginia dr mi ,they are so good they , good but not great
i used to like this product until i learned that it is made in china br br how many more stories do we need to hear about such as lead in baby toys made in china contaminated baby formula made in china contaminated tooth paste made in china and pet food before we learn that if it comes from china it should not go in your mouth your baby mouth or your pet mouth ,this product is made in china , great product
this is by far the most delicious snack you could ever have the almonds are super fresh and crunchy and the light coating of syrup is not too sweet my whole family loves it ,love the nut , delicious
my husband and both love almonds i have even shared this snack with co workers and everyone is raving about the good taste of this snack i am taking a few bags on our next backpacking trip ,great almond crunch , delicious
it better than a bag of potato chips these taste very crunchy and tasty br br given the kind of food stories we read about china we need to see some kind of and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these you just cannot import food stuff and sell in the us as gourmet snack food there needs to be this br br few example of chinese food yuk br br melamine kind of in baby food and milk so wide spread that of milk in china contained this plastic in br br honey contaminated with because of which it was banned in the us br br soy sauce made from human hair not google it if you want br br drugs to african countries br br need some good facts and quality from the manufacturers that the chinese producers are with some good quality ,great taste but what goes read on , great taste
the negative reviews of mrs mays products just because it is made in china are not really cannot base on other companies poor quality control and apply to every company in the country there are many bad quality foods that are made in the usa that is bad for your health so just because it is labeled made in usa does not mean it is good quality as long as a company takes in their quality control and not for profit only deserves good ratings and fair sales ,quality , not as good as it is
this is a great product we tried it at the beach the first time and loved it the cashew crunch was not as good br we bought a case of the almond this week just great ,mrs may make my days , great taste
i am in love with this tea every other apple cinnamon tea i have tried has been too cinnamon y this is the perfect blend it tastes like apple cider without all the sugar which i love i recommend this tea to anyone who wants a low cal version of apple cider ,best flavor , not as good as it is
this is the perfect gift with a the jelly were of decent size the is a nice quality piece with a small glass chili pepper attached br br cute little bag great gift for the price ,perfect gift with a touch of the , great product
i thought it was okay but not bbq sauce from hell i would not get it again also it was not worth the money i thought it was kind of a it was for sauce you could have made at home ,it is okay , not as good as it is
pasta has been made at the in italy since i love italian food but have severe digestive and allergic problems and their pasta is friendly to me and it tastes better than any other pasta i have eaten and that is a lot it is one of my favorite foods ,best pasta and its organic , great product
best taste pasta cooks very well slightly less time than typical mass produced pasta nice color and mouthfeel just excellent ,wow excellent , best ever
i have long searched for a great and and this is it just made with clam sauce and each time my husband how terrific it is i buy in packages of for both and and will reorder when close to being out ,tastes just like it was home made , great stuff
good product just a little mellow on the pumpkin pie flavor to me a little sugar on top before you brew it a enough though overall good coffee ,good , good stuff
these are hard to find these days product arrived perfect and the gum was fresh and tasty we kept the box for about year and the last pack tasted as good as the first ,what can you say there , great
gum made without sugar substitutes is not easily obtained these days so i was happy to find through amazon prime sugar substitutes present problems for persons sensitive to them so it is good to have the option of gum made the old fashioned way another source for this and other gum from is vermont country store online however sells the same box of for so clearly amazon is a better deal amazon prime free shipping makes it a much better deal br br my great grandpa used to come home with from time to time so this gum is not just loaded with long lasting peppermint flavor but long lasting happy memories as well i guess you can say there is a lot packed into such a little piece of gum hope you enjoy as much as i do ,and a taste of the fresh as new , not as good as it is
canned and bottled green tea which can be expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the us in the beginning what i found was either too expensive had sugar in it which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place or did not get very good reviews then i found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping i was pleasantly surprised br br the product works as advertised it dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too the instructions say to use one packet for ounces of water but actually it should be used with ounces of water otherwise it can be too bitter br br it not only saves money but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that i need to recycle monthly ,finally an delicious green tea powder , not as good as i be
a few drops of stevia to sweeten the drink it does not take a lot br br the best thing is that the tea powders cost about or less than the bottled green teas i use to drink br br br br to end on a personal note i have my drinking habits and now drink liter of the tea powder drink and liter of water per day i still drink can of dr pepper on the weekend but that is it i have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my drinking habits and the fish oil pills i have lost about lbs and am due to get my checked in a couple of weeks br br i hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is ,great alternative to green tea , great product
have some suggestions br br for strongest blueberry taste use less than the ounces of water that the instructions indicate my first try came out like water with the hint of blueberry br br stir really well and be prepared for a bit of anyway as well as for an oddly green i know it is green tea but i rarely drink green things so it seemed a bit weird to me at first and br br if you are going to use a sweetener why cancel out the health by adding something like aspartame or splenda or etc i added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect but then i also like it without any sweetener at all as long as i use less water br br by the way this makes hot tea as well although it is marketed as iced tea powder br br enjoy ,nice substitute for soda or tea , in the in the
i ordered this item because it was on sale and because of the health benefits of green tea i was not certain how good it was going to be but i was pleasantly surprised it tastes refreshing and fruity the flavor is not overpowering or fake i mix the powder in a sports bottle along with cold water and splenda the powder dissolves easily and the drink has a nice green tea and blueberry taste i was so impressed that i have signed up for automatic delivery it is a great product ,flavorful and refreshing , not as good as it is
flavor when you order this tea you will get six boxes with packets in each if you use two packets per bottle of water you get drinks that is only cents per drink if you get free shipping i ordered some books too i think that is fairly reasonable i look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices a website is given for additional recipes there are a few interesting recipes like the ones for white chocolate green tea ice cream green tea nectar and green tea sugar cookies you will probably find many uses for this and i have even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea just use one packet per ounces of hot water no brewing required this tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water i can highly recommend it to you br br the rebecca review ,very priced and delicious , not as good as it is
lots of uses for this green tea br br i generally like most tea though not the over flowery blends br br being on more of a health kick in recent years i have added a lot more green tea to my diet in one form or another br from straight brewed tea lt hot or iced br br to adding the powder to things like salad dressings smoothies baked goods etc br br i am not new to green tea as i first started drinking it when living in japan some years ago br in the ground form known as matcha br a quality product dissolves well br br i like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened ,lots of for this green tea , great tea
i expected the flavor to be more like that of brewed green tea it really does taste like dried green tea leaves simply dissolved in water although i am sure this is probably a good way to get a concentrated amount of antioxidants i would not order this again ,up leaves , great tea
ingredients listed pure cane sugar and pure powdered japanese green tea br br nutrition facts all except sodium mg and sugar g br br basic instructions add one packet to oz of cold water and stir or shake well to dissolve br br my opinion it is too sweet for my taste even diluted in a oz water bottle it almost tastes like sugar water i think the unsweetened version would be better star because it delivers what it promises br br this is japanese green tea not chinese green tea there is a difference ,my experience , not as good as it is
i keep this at work and i mix in my smoothies at home love it ,very , great product
this tea is not so tasty in my opinion but one thing about opinions is that every one has one and we do not always agree ,handy but not to tasty , great tea
i make a jug of this tea every morning and keep a glass throughout the day i am delighted to find a source in the us as it was introduced to me in b c it does not have the jasmine flavor which upsets my otherwise very strong tummy ,stash instant green tea , great tea
as others have said this is really mild in flavor the instructions call for packet per oz of water there are packets per box br br i decided to give it a try as i am basically lazy and wanted some unsweetened iced tea that i could make on a moment whim br br i started with packet per oz of water then packets per oz of water and got some flavor now i am using packets per oz of water i placed a fairly large order so i could experiment with it and have it throughout the fall and winter br br since i am using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor i will probably not order this item again ,stash premium mint green iced tea powder , not as good as it is
i have been drinking green tea powder for a few years and have come to love the slightly bitter and flavor of it i decided to try the stash brand instead of my normal japanese brand and it is not even in the same the stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all seriously the stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it real authentic green tea powder is supposed to be tea with no additives br br if you drink a lot of green tea you will be very disappointed with the stash product i strongly recommend you go with a japanese brand that contains tea only br br i tried to return it to amazon but they do not allow grocery items to be returned ,no flavor not authentic , not as good as i have
this is good iced tea it is hard to find locally in the fall and winter ,good tea , great tea
this is a quick and convenient way to drink green tea i add lemon juice and stevia ,stash green tea powder , great tea
to get a more intense taste i mix two packets in a oz bpa free bottle adding oz of water and the rest ice plus a packet of stevia shake well sip and oh so good no calorie sweet tea green tea antioxidants and i am drinking a lot more water i also carry packets in my purse and add to water in restaurants saving tons of money from ordering drinks and not to mention calories although the stash rep tells me there is a negligible amount of caffeine the effect gives me a great boost in the morning before my workout since i love mint i think i have found the perfect product ,love it , great product
this tea is more ginger than lemon so if you like the taste of soothing ginger you would like this product i mix two packages per oz bpa free bottle filled with oz of water and the rest ice and a packet of stevia shake well take sip no calorie sweet tea green tea antioxidant and great for summer i called the stash company to find out how much caffeine was in a packet and the rep said negligible br br i also buy the stash powdered mint green tea and i prefer the hint of mint better again if you are a ginger fan you would really enjoy this product ,for ginger fans , not as good as i be
i think this is a great green tea powder i add this powder to a oz water bottle and it has a nice light taste i prefer it so that i may add a sweetner if needed great price for the quantity and the quality of the product ,great for on the go makes water a little less , great tea
i use the powdered tea powder in my fruit smoothies provides you all the health benefits of green tea love the product and use both the plain and lemon ginger ,great health , great tea
i like the mild sweet flavor of this instant tea i have added it to lots of different drinks like juices and energy drinks i have fun mixing it with things it blends well for me ,good for on the go , great taste
this is a quick easy way to make green tea it is not sweet only has the hint of blueberry but it makes it easy when pressed for time in the morning it does have more green to it than most teas here is why sencha green tea comes from the region of japan it is made from small leaves and has a more refined taste than others forms of green tea additionally the color of the tea is actually green not yellow like many chinese varieties powdered tea is also good for cooking as well ,good tea taste not sweet , great tea
i went on a diet last year and was looking for something to drink and came across this now i cannot find it anywhere hope amazon keeps this product forever ,tastes great , great taste
individual serving size packets i am also a big fan of stash products or rather of all the other stash products i have tried br i purchased a case of all varieties when i say i drink iced tea i am not kidding and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my ounces water bottle br i finally found that i needed to dissolve packets in a small bit of hot water first if not the tea clumped on me and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable br unfortunately by doing that to this flavor the ginger was out of control and not in a good ginger tea sort of way br over all i am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market ,way too weak for my tastes , not bad
just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast i went from thinking boxes would be a lot to experiencing them as hardly br br basically this product has a mild taste never bitter or oily and not gritty but it will need to be if you do not drink it down quickly the powder does mix well it is really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything it blends completely into the water but it does not stay mixed over a long period of time so if you are letting it sit in the glass about min or so as you sip away it is useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along that works for me no complaints i am very happy with the product i will order again ,mild taste easy to mix will buy again , good but not as good as it is
and decided to try it using stevia as the sweetener i bought the lemon ginger flavor br br by comparison i think the lipton powdered iced tea i had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity kool aid for adults this is different i am having to get used to the green tea taste and it upset my stomach a little when i drink hot tea i usually drink white tea because i like the mild taste br br i tried using only half to a third of the packet in ounces of water and that worked better i would probably like white tea better but stash does not make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix anyway i hope to get used to the taste since right now i like it watered down it is really a good deal as far as price ,this product for the first time , not my favorite tea
i wanted something easy tasty and healthy to sub for my diet soda addiction this did the trick i drank it for days without adding any sweetener once you get past the color which is a nasty green the tea is tasty about a half tsp of sugar really adds to the taste i will buy this again ,got me off the diet soda , delicious
if you like the flavor of green tea and like your beverage iced you will enjoy this beverage br br i like the taste of green tea and i also like the health benefits of green tea i mix this with ice water and splenda it is a refreshing summer beverage i like that it dissolves easily and is packaged in small packages it is convenient and easy to use ,nice green iced tea beverage , not as good as i like
instant tea add to bottled water packets this is the real deal if you want sweet then order the sweet variety or add your favorite sweetener when you add the powder it is green looks alittle weird but once you can get past the looks it is true love i think it is delightful that i am actually consuming the entire leaf finely ground to which it thus making my water become water before my eyes that has to certainly be more bang for your buck for the level of antioxidants opposed to the old brewing way br i have had a very difficult journey until now finding yummy healthy quick unsweetened flavored teas my second favorite is the celestial seasonings cool brew bags the blueberry green tea is also delicious but not nearly as refined as this top shelf stash br i am more flavors for my next order ,yum yum yum , not as good as i be
what can i say i love iced tea i drink a lot of it and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets i am also a big fan of stash products or rather of all the other stash products i have tried br i purchased a case of all varieties when i say i drink iced tea i am not kidding and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my ounces water bottle br i finally found that i needed to dissolve packets in a small bit of hot water first if not the tea clumped on me and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable br over all i am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market ,way too weak for my tastes , not as good as i be
good flavor but not real sweet i add a little stevia for my sweet tooth ,of , good but not great
drank an instant green tea from a major producer for several years then they changed production and began using sucralose which i do not tolerate well br tried several different teas before i found stash instant green tea i like it best with a little fresh lemon lime juice i can drink all i want don t even need sweetener plus as i understand it it is just made from dried green tea leaves no chemical process also it is very i get a discount having it delivered by monthly subscription k ,best instant green tea ever , not as good as it is
i wanted to love or even like this drink mix but am not having success doing so i love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me it is too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it every once in a while i will try to tolerate a bottle again hoping i change my taste it is not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people ,not for me , not as good as it is
this ice tea is like heaven on ice must try if you love lemon and great price for the content you can make a pitcher with bags and add some lemon and whatever your sweetner you prefer great for barbeque parties or a tea with the ladies ,ice tea , great tea
this tea is awesome you have to keep stirring it if it sits too long but the taste is great little prep time keeps me going all day ,great tea , great tea
this product is great i have been searching for an easy to use and non sweetened green tea so many of the teas are sweetened with splenda type sweeteners and i prefer to use stevia the green tea appears to have been discontinued br br i mix this product and love the taste a little lemon and stevia and i have the perfect evening iced tea it provides all the benefits of green tea and the instant convenience br br i give it five stars ,great tasting and easy to use , great tea
this is the best iced green tea i have ever had the hint of blueberry is just perfect i add a bit of stevia for a little more sweetness it would be an insult to call this instant tea but i carry a packet in my purse because it is better than any prepared tea i could buy when eating out stash tea is always good but this is extraordinary ,perfect summer tea , great tea
would be enough for an oz water content you would need to have at least or packets for you to have that strong mint flavor br br but the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it well in this case it has natural peppermint in it is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats such as smoothies and even desserts just the other day i even added the unsweetened green tea powder on my muesli hot cereal and it was delicious i plan to do the same with this stash mint green tea powder i m an experimenting foodie so does not hurt to try lol with my hot cereal and milk br br you can even substitute milk instead of water ever tasted green tea latte that you get from starbucks and juice before try it with this one ,just had a , not as good as i
i wasted a little over because the reviews were so good br this has no taste cold or hot it states to use oz of cold water br well i used just a cup and it did not work out for me br i tried adding more packets and it helped but very little br i am an avid tea and coffee drinker and can only resolve br that the other reviewers have never had a good strong cup br of green tea or i am missing something here br i do not recommend this tea ,does not have taste , not as good as it is

this tea is the most awful stuff i have ever put in my mouth it has a chemical taste i tried adding sugar and it did not help i enjoy the arizona pomegranate tea and would highly it ,awful , not as good as it is
this tea has an awfully light flavor i use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea very tasty i generally shake ounces cold milk packets of this tea powder and ounce simple syrup then pour it over ice tho make the frappe i blend the same ingredients with ice instead of pouring it over ice it is annoying that to make a small drink i need to use times more than expected ,makes great but you have to use a lot , great tea
i have had quite a few sencha powders in my time the stash product is one of the best priced products out there br br that said what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with oz of water i can barely taste the tea and i am pretty sensitive to tea flavors if you get this product keep your mixes at oz of water otherwise it is like you are drinking a flavorless br br otherwise it is a good product at a good price at proper the flavor is good and you cannot beat the health benefits of a good sencha green tea ,not bad a bit light , not as good as it is
i first tried these powdered green teas from stash last summer this spring i wanted more but the store i got them from did not think the vendor would be carrying any i was delighted to find that i could get them from amazon i ordered a whole bunch and look forward to having refreshing real food drinks all summer in an easy to make form ,great product , great taste
i finally finished my box of the blueberry green tea powder and wanted to try something new so glad i tried this flavor as it is now my favorite just add it to a cold bottle of water drink it as is or add a few drops of stevia or agave and you are good to go very refreshing will be packing this on my trip to mexico ,first time , best tea ever
lots of uses for this green tea br br i generally like most tea though not the over flowery blends br br being on more of a health kick in recent years i have added a lot more green tea to my diet in one form or another br from straight brewed tea lt hot or iced br br to adding the powder to things like salad dressings smoothies baked goods etc br br i am not new to green tea as i first started drinking it when living in japan some years ago br in the ground form known as matcha br a quality product dissolves well br br i like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened ,quality lightly green tea powder , great tea
as a long time tea drinker was happy to come across this iced tea mix it serves as my sports drink while exercising or i find this iced tea very refreshing i really like the flavor and especially the low sugar content the plain green is my favorite followed by the raspberry the blueberry is good too it is unsweetened so i add half a packet of truvia ,not too sweet not too strong just right , not as good as it is
i really enjoy this tea because it is not to sweet and it is easy to use i carry it and my mug with me and just add hot or cold water depending upon my mood i find that it gives me just the right kind of energy and it can even hold my hunger between meals a real great thing because i watch my calories and of course green tea is full of antioxidants ,great pick me up on the go hot or cold , great product
this is good iced tea it is hard to find locally in the fall and winter ,good stuff , great tea
i am hooked this is a great way to get more fluids into my day without making it seem like a this powder tastes great without any additional sweeteners it is just what i have been looking for also try the blueberry version delicious ,refreshing drink , great product
green tea is good for you loaded with antioxidants your yadda yadda yadda but i never quite warmed up to the taste until now the lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor and it is so great that i can just add a packet to my water bottle and go without the bother of brewing it ,easy and tasty for better health , great tea
just the right amount of blueberry flavor and the tea itself is not overwhelming i love that it has no added sweeteners and really does not need them br this is a perfect way to get more water and benefit from the antioxidants in the tea as well ,very refreshing , great tea
i drink this delicious tea almost every day i have yet to find anything like it on the market ,love it , great tea
love this product it adds flavor to your water without all the nasty artificial sweetners hope this product is here to stay ,refreshing to water , great product
powdered green tea with lemon ginger provides quick daily source of antioxidant ingredients desired but in higher concentration and without the bother of brewing tea bags simply pour in water bottle shake and be on your way br br product used to be available in local health food stores but is no longer carried much easier and more cost effective when bought in quantity on amazon ,powdered green tea by stash , great tea
a href http www amazon com gp product b stash premium green iced tea powder count packets pack of a easy to mix and refreshing with ice ,refreshing flavor , great taste
i was looking for mint green tea i could carry with me to mix up while out and about if that is what you want then this product is perfect i add a little extra water but that is just my taste so if you are looking for mint green tea powder look no further ,just as expected , not as good as it is
this has a great rich taste remember this is ground whole leaf so the tea is stronger than you may expect not overly sweet and dissolves readily i use it during mixed with ice water in a bottle ,great taste and convenient , great taste
i liked the flavor and the ease to mix this tea i use a few packets and make a pitcher to keep in the fridge very good cold and needs no sweetening as is lightly sweet already does not look pretty but does look like a healthy drink i liked it ,tea , not as good as it is
i purchased this item when it was on sale i was not certain if i would like it but i have read so much about the health benefits of green tea i wanted to try it this is a nice pleasant beverage the flavor is not too strong i add a packet of splenda to make it a bit sweeter the powder dissolves easily in cold water the flavor is natural not fake i was impressed enough with it that i have signed up for auto delivery ,refreshing summer beverage , not as good as it is
the tea was very weak and not that good now i have six boxes of tea i that no one in my family likes ,waste of money , great tea
could add to my s s water bottle gotta be good to the environment right the flavor is great ease of convenience is wonderful and the hint of sweet is not overpowering at all i can drink my green tea with or without sweetener the only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long the calories will add up i think each packet is calories i drink oz bottles of water a day so that would be calories of sweetened drink a day but i will still give the product stars because the product is i would just pick something else if i am going to pound water all day long perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is not sweetened it is excellent as well i will use this for one bottle and a non sweetened one for the other best of both worlds enjoy ,great product at last , great product
i used to always go to juice for the match green tea shots after trying this iced green tea powder i was hooked this flavor is lightly and the raspberry and pomegranate flavors are just subtle enough to not mask the true flavor of the green tea i do not mind the funny green color after all it is green tea ,lightly sweet and than an juice , great tea
this iced tea is terrible this is the first stash product that i do not enjoy it is not iced tea it tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves ,terrible , great tea
the first ingredient in this mix before the tea is even listed is maltodextrin if you suffer from a corn allergy please do not forget to read the label drink this i have no idea why there is more maltodextrin in this product than the main product the tea itself i realize this is not a review let alone a helpful review as i did not describe the taste of the product or even review the product i could not review this product if i wanted too i want people with a corn allergy to be advised of the ingredients in the tea i did not know how else to inform folks about the ingredients except for on the page with reviews i could not give the product more stars as it contains more maltodextrin than tea itself ,beware if you have a corn allergy , not as good as i have
tea leaf which gives you times more antioxidants wow that was good for me so i got a couple cases and when i ran out searched the internet for stash brand i really love it i love that it is lightly sweetened i love that i can just open a packet and throw it into my tumbler add ice and water and be on my way it is just right but more then anything else i love the way it makes me feel so much more energy and i truly believe it is helping my well being no getting around about it i do not get sick often for sure now i have not tried the other brands and i feel i do not have to because i am so satisfied with this one the price is also cheaper i do not think you can go wrong with this choice ,lightly green iced tea powder , great product
love the ease of having green natural tea any time tastes great i love this stash green tea ,great product , great product
i bought this tea as i like blueberries and stash is known as making good teas however when i first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green not very appetizing once i mixed the powder with water the resulting tea had no real flavor i feel like i wasted my money and cannot get a refund ,not so much , not as good as it is
this is one of my favorite water add ins i think it has a really crisp clean taste with a hint of grassy ness the tea tend to settle at the bottom of the bottle if left standing for more than a few minutes so i have to shake it up there are times when i feel like i am drinking something that was squeezed off the blades of a but this seems to be based on my choice of sweetener it tastes great when i use stevia but when i use sweet low i get a bitter ish grassy taste ,pretty good stuff with the right sweetener , best ever
useless br br if you plan on making a pitcher of tea forget it it takes packs for oz and is still very very weak in flavor and it must be consumed in hours so they say so you are much better off brewing your own br br however if you are idea is to stash this in your purse for the ladies or pocket for men which would be weird it is still misses the mark one packet does very little for flavor with oz of water so you would have to use two and who drinks just oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature also with only to packets in a box depends on flavor who knows why that gives you to oz drinks for not sure it is worth it at all i would rather drink lemon water when out than this ,do not , this is the best

i wish i had read the product description better i didn t realize this was sweetened i do not like the sweetened teas now i am stuck with orders of them but the other green tea powder is great ,stash tea powder review , not as good as it is
when i saw the mint iced tea powder on the website i thought i would like it but when i received it and tried one i was very disappointed it was the green tea and not sweet at all the flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like i was expecting i had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that i like to be similar to regular iced tea i do not even know if i will be using the others i had received sorry about this but you did ask for my review on this ,the mint tea i bought , great tea
what a lovely tea this is the rose are in the mix and when you brew a pot of tea and then raise the cup to your lips the full sweet scent of roses you this tea is perfectly blended and balanced its color is golden very warm and luscious i just want to drink it every day for relaxation and enjoyment ,real and all the delicious flavor , great tea
believe this additive is the to what should have been a delightful to my nose then i brewed this tea and could still taste that additive but overall the tea was tasty i hope the davidson family reads our reviews because i am certain that if they would just from adding the natural flavor i and others would find this tea to be superb and in keeping with the other teas i have come to enjoy from davidson for example upon opening their darjeeling loose tea as well as their assam loose tea my nose is struck with a lovely this is what one wants to experience from superb teas i will look forward to davidson to my and other customer suggestion re this nasty flavor additive i have enjoyed tea with rose while in india and they did not put anything other than the tea and the dried rose ,the natural flavor , nice for green tea
this tea was horrible it tasted like potpourri i have really enjoyed other davidson teas many also containing flowers and thought to try something new i think the last ingredient is where things went bad it was natural flavor which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all ,i i just got a bad batch , great tea
was so excited because i thought i had finally found the equal to another brand rose tea in individual bags i was excited for the loose quality of the tea along with the anticipated light delicate taste i would hoped for br i was sadly mistaken when i opened it i was hit by a very sweet syrupy candy like smell coming from the bag not a good scent then i thought the smell does not determine the taste so i steeped the recommended tablespoons for the amount of time indicated and then tried a taste the overpowering sweet smell gave was to a bitter taste not at all reminiscent of my previous experience with rose tea unfortunately i had to pour the rest of mine out br i have a bag of hibiscus tea coming in the mail soon from this company i am really hoping it is better ,not too , not as good as i be
wow i am a pepsi holic and was gaining weight as you can imagine a little year old woman introduced me to your tea hot and now with just a little bit of honey and ice i have a nice cool refreshing drink ,no more for me , great product
i am pleased the bag is so large it means i will be sipping this tea for a while this tea is perfect for the start of the work day the rose and hibiscus my senses the caffeine me to type a bit faster as i over a of e the flavors are a bit more pungent than similar blends i have mixed on my own is the cause the natural flavor another reviewer pointed out but it is still quite pleasant i certainly look forward to many more mornings begun over several cups of rose ,pleased , great tea
the fragrance of the tea totally blew me away recommend it to anyone who enjoys mild green tea with a pleasant scent ,perfect , great tea
i am enjoying this tea and the price was reasonable i do not think the rose flavor is as pronounced as my favorite rose tea but since i can not get that one at this time i ordered this one and it is very good ,leaf tea , great tea
i bought this tea many months ago and waited to review it to see if i really liked it over time br br i do this tea is really lovely the rose scent and taste are just right not too lame not too overwhelming i find it slightly calming even with the caffeine from the black tea of the or so loose teas in my drawer that i regularly use this is the one i seem to reach for most often i am about brewing times this one is min and i set the gives me a perfect cup every time br br don t forget that it is organic support organic practices and do something beneficial for your body br br this tea was a good buy and has the test of time for me ,lovely tea , not as good as i have
good beans i cannot find these in the grocery stores where i live but ordered them through this retailer with no problems ,yum , good
or beans are to be used in asian sweets you can make sweet bean paste by boiling the beans for min changing the water out at least twice and the beans with sugar strain the paste if you do not like the bean skins what you get is a paste that can be put on ice cream fill or stuff into mochi cakes ,beans , great product
their not only good for you but their yummy they smell like cloves when their cooking and taste a little sweet ,yummy , good
good stuff like lentils you do not need to soak these they are small so feel good in the mouth ,beans , good
i really like this flavoring i try to stay away from sugar and artificial sweeteners so this was perfect because it contains absolutely no sweetener so i can add my own mostly liquid stevia i also love vanilla flavoring in many things i make so i sometimes use this in place of extract which can be pricey if you use it a lot for example i make my own almond milk so i like to add vanilla to sweeten and the taste this works better than an extract because there is no alcohol taste i also make blueberry syrup with agave and this flavoring and it turns out very good i put it in pancake batter and the flavor still holds after cooking also with cookies i use this all the time and now i am not dropping every couple of weeks for vanilla extract ,works for me , not as good as you are
i wanted to love this but i just didn t despite being sugar free it has calories per pump and in my opinion needs three to add enough flavor to my iced vanilla lattes if your going for calorie count this is not favorable i would however say if you think other brands are a bit too sweet or if calorie count is not overly important you should give it a go it may be just what you were looking for as a side note if calorie count is i recommend their coconut cream flavor a href http www amazon com gp product b premium coconut cream syrup ml a its delicious ,decent but is better , not as good as it is
we purchased from the original website flavored sugars all but the raspberry was worth the money the rest had little or no flavor at all it was expensive and not worth the money ,do not waste your money , not as good as it is
we have been eating this delightful cereal for several years my kids always feel better on gluten free foods and so do i unlike the popular cereals this version of a slightly chocolately cereal is light and not too sugary and it is a special treat for the kids i also like supporting products the pricing has come down to where it is nearly the same as the other mainstream cereals that are not as good for you ,crisps rock , great product
i have never tasted any better need to keep refrigerated or it will lose color and flavor but is worth the price ,the best ever , great
mixed with whipped cream and blueberries this lemon is a delicious easy quick summertime dessert that will delight any guests ,easy summer dessert , great product
the popcorn itself is yummy just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper the kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped it is great in the microwave or a pan but maybe the larger white or yellow would be a better match for an air popper ,a , great popcorn
i will not claim to be a professional food taster i just know what i like and do not like i do not like yellow popcorn i do not like microwave popcorn i like the white popcorn cooked in a pan for my popping style the baby white pops great w o lots of hard kernels said ,great popcorn , best popcorn ever
this is really good tender a little sweet easy to make in the whirley pop and excellent with some cheddar spice popcorn seasoning ,keep , great taste
i love the popcorn but the shipping costs are insane a total rip off wabash valley farms or amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind stars for the popcorn minus stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping yes the popcorn is tender and luscious and it melts in your mouth like you are eating cooked but come on cannot you ship this product for less br br shipping the pound bag is even worse sigh too bad really ,shipping is , best popcorn ever
we like the much harder to find white popcorn over the more common yellow popcorn and amish country baby white is our absolute favorite we usually order of the lb bags because we go thru it so quickly ,our favorite , best popcorn ever
i love this popcorn only downside is the shipping and packing cost almost as much as the popcorn need to pack it better bag split and a bunch of loose popcorn falling out of the box when the guy brought it to my door ,good popcorn , best popcorn ever
i purchased the baby white by accident we usually get the medium white which is great the baby is so small when popped that the taste and texture of the hull shell really overwhelm it ,too small too much not enough white , best popcorn ever
tasty small kernel popcorn however too small and too light to be popped in a hot air popcorn popper the kernels are blown out of the popper before they are popped ,tasty popcorn but too small for a hot popcorn , best popcorn ever
the gourmet corn is smaller kernels than i like so would probably not buy it again but with their special oil and the stir crazy popper every kernel pops every time br br i will probably return to good old jolly time ,small pops , great product
this is the best popcorn i have ever ate i use a whirley popper to pop my popcorn when you eat this baby white hulless you will never go back to any other popcorn i gave my orville redenbacher and walmart popcorn away to many you just cannot beat this popcorn it tastes sooooo good even my puppy loves it ,the best , best popcorn ever
popcorn at my year old home i thought it was so tender and delicious and i wanted to buy some for myself i found it on amazon com believe it or not anyway i ordered pounds of it all pounds are now gone this popcorn is really good it is different than other popcorns i have eaten because the kernels are small and very delicate i consider myself a pro when it comes to popcorn because i have eaten it every night since i was a little girl i usually eat my popcorn kernel at a time but since the kernels are so small i ate it by the handful my only complaint is that it does cost a lot to have it shipped i wish i could find it locally so i would not have to pay for the shipping costs if you like popcorn i highly recommend it ,amish baby white popcorn , best popcorn i have ever had
over the years i have bought a lot of popcorn for popping and i have found this small baby white hulless to be the best for popping and not a lot of the so called old i also had to my plus year old wabash valley farms stovetop popper it was a good one so if you like popcorn and who does not this popcorn and popper combination is the best and the popper comes with a year as well money well spent you will not dissapointed with either of them so enjoy ,popcorn do not get any better than this , best popcorn ever
this is the best popcorn i have ever had as a kid i ran the popcorn machine in a theater so i feel i know what i am talking about we used yellow popcorn but i still think white is best ,best popcorn , best popcorn ever
baby white popcorn from wabash farms pops nicely has no hulls to get into your teeth and is very tasty what more could you ask from a popcorn i highly recommend this product at least a four star ,baby white popcorn is tasty and has no to get into teeth , great popcorn
the small white popcorn is the best very delicious and i have tried lots ,enjoy , great popcorn
this was the sweetest smallest hulless best tasting white popcorn i have ever had just placed an additional order for a lb bag as well as other carried by this company ,best popcorn ever , best popcorn ever
great popcorn good popping results and wonderful flavor cannot help but love it and i will re order when i run out recommend to one and all ,great , great sauce
i love little white kernels of popped corn this was good stuff but i think i will try a larger white kernel to pop next time my preference ,good stuff , best ever
pops great in the microwave much better than many store brands good product ,popcorn lovers love this popcorn , great product
my doctor told me i must eat hulless popcorn if i have popcorn at all because i cannot give up my favorite snack i bought this wabash farms amish country popcorn the kernels are tiny but they pop well although not as big and fluffy as the popcorn i get from the grocery store it tastes great however and has fewer and smaller hulls i do not think there is such a thing as completely hulless but notice i do not get the hulls stuck in my teeth anymore ,very good , best popcorn ever
i ordered lb bags with free shipping because of the reviews i really like it but the real test was my wife opinion and we also ordered and lbs of popcorn from the popcorn co and the kernels were a little smaller and tasted better we use coconut oil and it has very good flavor even without butter i really like the cream kernels the best ,good stuff , best popcorn ever
i just made some in my whirley pop it really is lighter and than the larger yellow kernels none of those large hulls either the only difference is it pops up much smaller than the yellow so you need to almost double the amount of kernels used per pot lovely homemade popcorn ,crispy light , not as good as it is
use olive oil to cook this salt it well and it is the best most tender popcorn i have ever eaten i add a tiny bit of butter to mine but do not need it my nine year old daughter did not like popcorn until she tried this after a few bites she consumed half the bowl br br i bought mine at a specialty popcorn shop in long grove so i did not have to pay shipping costs but when it is gone i might have to bite the and order it from here ,me for other popcorn , best popcorn ever
wish i would have read the reviews that discuss the product performance in hot air poppers the pc is very tasty and light with no kernel shells that get stuck in your teeth stars br br problem with using it in hot air poppers is that the kernels are too light and fly out of the machine before they pop the machine helps keep them inside but it would be just to find another larger kernel corn ,the on hot , not as good as it is
we have enjoyed this popcorn every bit as much if not more than the movie theater popcorn it is light and fluffy tender and delicious i think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no palm oil or coconut oil in it we can control what oils we add or leave out it works well with the popper in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other we enjoyed this more ,amish country baby white popcorn , best popcorn ever
popcorn has color white but taste is average and due to shipping costing more then product i would not buy again ,average taste , best popcorn ever
popcorn brands br br let me tell you it is worth the extra money i can really taste the difference in quality and normal popcorn just does not taste right when you make it in the whirley pop br br this popcorn is so tender and tasty it was a little weird to see and eat at first because it is about half the size of regular popcorn but i believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn br br my favorite prep methods include using the whirley pop and nutiva organic extra virgin coconut oil see my review for that for more details i add a little peanut oil sea salt black pepper and a good amount of garlic mist cooking seasoning spray yummy br br i ve tried the other amish country popcorn and they are all good this is my favorite though ,great little mini popcorn , best popcorn ever
this popcorn is really great we enjoy the taste and the of the actual popcorn its not like the popcorn that is big and fluffy its small and really great to eat i eat only this popcorn now and order every three months highly recommend to the popcorn lovers of the world ,in the popcorn world , best popcorn ever
i bought a bowl to pop the corn in along with this popcorn and put two in the bowl and set the microwave on popcorn but it needed more popping for all to pop in fact almost twice as much time but the results are great br today we will get the seasoning i bought for it and look forward to using it to have a snack while watching tv ,great less popcorn , great popcorn
this is terrible popcorn no taste poor popping ratio and the size omg i popped this gourmet popping corn in front of a party everyone busted out in ,poor product , best popcorn ever
do not spend your money on this product as you will find the popping ratio extremely poor one cup of popcorn will have cup of un old kernels left over which is unacceptable this is a non returnable item so if you buy this one you are just out of luck so i recommend staying away from this one ,off , not as good as it is
this is my first time trying wabash valley farms amish country baby white br br pros it is okay with a nice mild nutty flavor the hulls are more pronounced than with some other amish baby white br br cons it tends not to pop up in fact we have burned several because popping it is tricky we found that the microwave often works better than pan popping and as mentioned above the hulls are much more noticeable than with other amish baby white brands br br we purchased these bags and we will use them up but will not be ordering any more next time we will drive the long distance to our nearest amish store ,okay but there is much better , best popcorn ever
if you like your popped corn small this is for you taste is good and it is crisp yet tender the only real complaint is it has a amount of hull ,good but , great product
popcorn is very good cant believe the difference between this popcorn and the regular stuff at the story a very good purchase ,very good , best popcorn ever
bought lbs of this popcorn based on reviews that the hulls are softer on this baby white than on regular popcorn not only are the hulls just as tough as regular popcorn the corn pops up so tiny that it is about hull popped corn per kernel i was hoping to use this as a healthy snack for my kids who love popcorn but not the hulls br i popped this using every tip i could find on the internet all experiments still resulted in a tough hull ,this is not less popcorn or even close , best popcorn ever
received the baby yellow instead of the correct baby white kernels unable to return the product since it is a grocery item but amazon com customer service did an excellent job and provided a full refund as far as can tell no other issues with product ,received wrong product , great popcorn
i liked the idea of the small popcorn it pops up really well in the popper but it does not have much if any popcorn flavor was pretty bummed by that ,pops well not much flavor , great stuff
i used to grow the japanese hulless in small quantities for my stovetop popper this is the closest i can find if you are by the shipping cost like i was try looking elsewhere for a better deal for instance one popular site offers lbs for with free shipping if you sign up for shipments which you can cancel any time try www c king com ,wow it is worth the cost for white , great product
i have made this my popcorn of choice i enjoy the flavor and size ,amish country baby white , best popcorn ever
get it get it get it this popcorn is truly the most tender delicious popcorn i have ever tasted ,wonderful , best popcorn ever
got three different amish popcorn for my daughter birthday she is always on a diet i got her the hot air popper same time she my grandson he is loved it she ate a bowl every night still lost lbs not saying it is a diet food just ,yummy , great stuff
i bought this popcorn as a gift for some dear friends the have commented back several times that it is the best popcorn they have ever had they love it they had shopped in the dc area to find white popcorn and could never find it so one look on amazon was all it took to find this the best popcorn ever ,best popcorn ever , best popcorn ever
i bought this for my daughter new microwave popcorn popper as a christmas gift and she says that it is delicious but pops up smaller than other popcorn she likes it a lot ,popcorn , best popcorn ever
this is very high pop corn i recomend it almost all kernels pop and they are a crisp white when they pop very healthy and yummy ,wonderful , great snack
pops fully few spare kernels with the traditional stovetop method small fluffy kernels not a lot of that are only partially my wife says they are a tad too small for her taste but the kids and i really love this popcorn ,just a too small for my wife taste but kids and i love it , great product
this popcorn brings me back to days before the microwave version what a treat it was to savor the taste and lightly salted white popcorn that was popped over the heat of a stove again ,small but good , great popcorn
i love this brand all kernels pop and they are a nice size texture and flavor ,love it , great taste
i have not eaten this popcorn or tasted it myself it was part of a gift for my daughter in grad school she likes the fluffy quality of the popped corn and the not so many hulls also the big bag makes her think she can make it last until christmas that remains to be seen without having to buy more a very good snack for a poor grad student ,great popcorn , best popcorn ever
i am a huge popcorn fan and have tried all sorts and the amish country brand popcorn is the best i have ever eaten absolutely delicious ,the best popcorn i have ever tasted , best popcorn ever
there are very seldom any unpopped kernels which is nice and the flavor is wonderful not a whole lot to say about popcorn i always buy from you guys and will continue to ,fabulous popcorn , best popcorn ever
i love white corn in all its forms including popcorn and i hate how expensive the kernels are in the supermarket so i love this popcorn ,yummy popcorn , best popcorn ever
i enjoy it practically every evening it is very good popcorn not as much hulls and small when popped ,great product a little but worth it , great popcorn
have to be concerned with the hulls causing choking or their tender gums my son has no trouble eating this popcorn it is soft and light does not get stuck in your teeth nearly as much and has a great flavor br br this is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family i usually pop it in my year old cheap hot air popper with no problems i get very few unpopped kernels another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping but i have not experienced this problem it could depend on the popper i suppose i have tried microwaving it in a paper bag but i always seem to end up burning it i think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right so i just stick with my hot air popper i get great popcorn every time ,a great popcorn for small , a great popcorn
i am so surprised that they have this popcorn for sale i received bags the other day and the special popcorn pan from wabash valley farms amish country gourmet well the popped kernels are the size of a pea and with hulls it burns very easily there are too many old due to the delicate nature of the kernel i ended up throwing most of the popped corn away i am so disappointed in this product i now have bags of this stuff i have nothing good to say about it but if you like tiny popped corn with lots of hulls then this may be your product i am giving mine to the squirrels ,the worst popcorn on the , the best popcorn i have ever had
i bought this with the pop popcorn popper and i made some as soon as i got them it is the best popcorn i have had i thought i would mind the smaller kernel size but i didn t there is substantially less hull than regular popcorn the flavor is great i suggest using peanut oil for popping popcorn it gives popcorn a great nutty taste really delicious you can buy peanut oil at any oriental asian store it is better than olive oil olive oil and popcorn is too weird for me but peanut oil is perfect you will not need butter flavor or anything like that again artificial butter flavorings are full of chemicals now we pop around three times a day and always crave this for a snack instead of try it and you will be popping like us ,excellent popcorn , best popcorn ever
the baby white popcorn has lots of hulls when popped very small kernels and the bottom of my new whirley popper i have had several poppers and this is the first time one has and the first time i have used the wabash corn shipping charges were very high for a relatively inexpensive corn ,popcorn , great popcorn
this popcorn has alot of hulls i order bags and cannot stand to eat it it is so terrible ,amish country baby white popcorn , great popcorn
the popcorn was delivered as promised in an attractive wrapper i used the whirley pop popcorn maker and used tablespoons of olive oil and popped it according to the instructions of the whirley popper while the majority of the kernels popped there was also a large amount of seeds or residue that can get caught in your teeth and are somewhat while you are eating i actually got better results using orville redenbacher white popcorn kernels in the whirley popper and it was actually cheaper at the local market overall i give amish country out of stars and mostly for the presentation of the package than for the yield results ,popcorn was , best popcorn ever
i ordered this because amazon recommended it to go along with the popcorn popper i got from them hey only a few of these actually pop most of these small unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper what an absolute waste of money ,but , great popcorn
this is good popcorn but it is very small so you need to make twice as much as you normally would ,small , great stuff
worst popcorn ive ever bought chewy not fluffy gave it to the for bird food postage was outrageous just not a good experience all around wont be buying from them ever again ,amish popcorn , best popcorn ever
this is delicious popcorn lost a star because i use a hot air popper and many of them jump out before popping great flavor great texture tender i do not add anything even though i have purchased three different flavored toppings br br thanks ,delicious popcorn , best ever
this baby white popcorn pops small and somewhat hard i have tried several batches with various adjustments of heat using a popcorn popper results i will not purchase this again ,baby white popcorn , great popcorn
we loved this popcorn but come on shipping is way over the top we would settle next time for something we can buy but not spend times on shipping ,great popcorn terrible price for shipping , great sauce
i can only go as low as star on the review though i would like to rate it a this item still shows in stock but clearly isn t which is why my order was canceled from amazon today amazon suggested i search out the item again and in doing so i see that this same vendor states the item is available not so br br technically this review does not to the quality of the product just the ability to be able to ship it good luck ,amish baby white popcorn not really in , not as good as it is
got this for like on a warehouse deal it was a bargain i received them in early may and the label says best before june at a rate of one can per days i do not think i will have a problem finishing them off before june i know i have a sweet tooth all cans had some dents on them but the condition of the inside was good they were just as described soft cheese balls about per can in a sugar syrup with just a hint of cardamom warm it up a before eating for the maximum flavor and texture ,yummy , good but not great
reasons for this the first of which is the great flavor of clams and potatoes second i like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and third that one can adjust the level of creaminess and with what one adds to the soup i like to use a mixture of milk and cream the fourth plus is that this soup contains neither bacon nor excessive amounts of spice or pepper two things that ruin clam chowder for me i know bacon is popular with a lot of folks but i really just want to taste the clams when i have a bowl of new england clam chowder if you are like me in that respect then i think you will like this soup too br br p s as a child i was a fan of friendly clam chowder before they changed their recipe bar harbor is even better ,in my the best clam chowder out there a perfect winter meal , good product
i have definitely had a against canned anything and still do picked this up at the supermarket drawn by the all natural ingredients for once no msg or really anything else i did not recognize it is really quite good and especially so for coming out of a can i can have excellent clam chowder and with a little milk and butter exactly to my liking warm within minutes one of the few canned goods i keep in my cabinet and one of the most convenient and surprisingly satisfying meals always minutes away br highly recommended ,yes it is from a can , great product
i have just prepared my first can of this soup it tasted incredibly bland and did not have much clam flavor so then i added more milk butter onions salt and fresh ground pepper plus white wine for per oz can all of those ingredients should have been added in there already except for the pepper bar harbor brand certainly did not on the other ingredients in order to increase the amount of clams that is for sure there were larger pieces of clams than in progresso but that is with faint praise next time i will buy the clams and make my own for less probably i am just perplexed by these reviews i think i can safely say progresso tastes better and of course it is much less expensive ,i too am , not as good as it is
this is our preferred clam chowder we like the natural taste with lots of potatoes the only complaint is i think the soup can be creamier amazon has much better price on this with subscribe and save ,bar all natural new clam chowder ounce cans pack of , best ever
i am a little perplexed by all the great reviews this was the most bland chowder i have ever had i prepared it with just milk and a little butter and it tasted like nothing added some salt and white pepper still nothing added some black pepper and herbs now it tastes like potato soup br br on the plus side the clams were nice big chunks and the potatoes were tender the consistency was pretty good too it just had no flavor not going to be buying this again certainly not when it is this expensive too ,tasteless , not as good as it is
it is not as good as i hoped but canned chowder never is i added some butter a can of chopped clams and some milk then thickened it a bit it works great as a base but not for me straight out of the can ,clam chowder , not as good as it is
at a at markets in seattle this summer people liked it so much the store sold out of all the ingredients during the br br easy to make instructions br oven to br spread bar harbor new england clam chowder right from the can onto the pizza dough br sprinkle pizza cheese to your desired br sprinkle cooked crumbled chopped bacon to your desired we like lots of bacon br bake pizza for minutes until bottom of crust is golden brown br remove from oven and let set for minutes before cutting br prepare to be amazed br br please follow bar harbor foods for delicious recipes using our great seafood sauces fish and seafood and clam juice br please follow us on and simply to each and find us with bar harbor foods br br we hope you enjoy let us know what you think br bar harbor foods ,clam pizza it is awesome and simple to make , a great product
i have had better canned clam chowder is one that comes to mind i do not buy the ones with preservatives or a long list of ingredients so my choice is limited for this one if i add just half a can of milk and a pat of butter along with some extra sea salt it is ok the longer it is gently heated not or boiled to let the flavors the better it becomes more clams and potatoes would improve it as it is the ingredients were skimpy ,decent canned clam chowder , not as good as it is
this is the best clam chowder ever come originally where this is produced and was so happy when i found it on line keep this in my cupboard at all time being an old maine girl this is my favorite chowder of all times ,bar clam chowder , best popcorn ever
the best canned clam chowder i have found currently available very light nicely seasoned creamy taste not fishy or good amount of minced clams per serving to find better chowder it would have to be homemade ,the best canned clam chowder available , best popcorn ever
bits of clam not sure in water with something i assume is potatoes whose recipe is this save your money get something worth having how do so many like this it is awful if you prefer real clam chowder and not with something floating in it do not buy this ,what is this stuff , not as good as it is
this is clearly the best canned clam chowder i have tasted it is refreshing to have a canned soup without all the unnecessary preservatives and artificial flavoring the can is supposed to be condensed but if you like a hearty thick soup it is better just heated without adding milk or water the clams are perfect and not over cooked i will order again and look forward to trying out some of the other products they have on amazon ,at it is best , best popcorn ever
my local store had the product close out at cents a can so i bought a dozen cans of different lobster soup was very fishy for starters and the chowder was very watered down the new england chowder is somehow creamy and void of flavor the clam corn chowder was not enjoyable br br i am real soup eater and take soup at least once a day and always when i out long story short this is the most tasteless soup and just not good i suggest you pass on this and i am sure will be a much better choice than these soups sorry i had leave an review bit this soup is just not worth eating and cents a can i would never buy this again ,not very good , not as good as it is
i expected better from a premium maine chowder this is no better than say snow which you can get for less than half the price not bad but not worth the money ,nothing special , not as good as it is
we opened a can of bar harbor clam chowder and could not believe how few clams were in the chowder there were mostly potatoes ,bar where are the , not as good as it is
i used to be a buyer at a natural organic grocery this is the best soup i have ever had in a can i am very picky about my clam chowder soup as my favorite is the clam chowder just add butter milk cream and black pepper have some fresh corn bread and butter and you are in heaven ,the best , best ever
for canned soup this is very good clam chowder those who give it or stars are comparing it to homemade soup or restaurant style soup i would buy this any day over other brands you can tell it is all natural and without loaded msg salt and other nasty ingredients pure and clean soup those who rate it badly some say it has no flavor or there are not chunks in it the flavor is mild but that is good not and not over salted like conventional brand canned soup if i want to next time i will add a potato cut up in chunks to boost it is contents not a big deal to do i would prefer to do that than buy a conventional brand that does not care about healthy ingredients and sourcing of ingredients i will buy this again good source of iron as well ,will buy again , not as good as i be
even though the chowder is very very good as is i add a can of the bar harbor chopped clams to it along with a can of heavy cream and a huge pat of br br yummy ,clam it up , great product
tried this yesterday as a treat on a cold fall night it had an unpleasant grainy and somewhat watery texture the clams were actually and gritty and the potatoes were kind of chalky for lack of a better term the flavor was also very lacking it did not really taste like well anything definitely not worth the price i can only imagine the people who wrote the good reviews either work for bar harbor or have never tried any other kind of clam chowder ,have , great taste
we had high expectations for this product but the chowder was only average warming instructions are as to the amount of milk and or butter to blend in with the soup mix we found the flavor to be bland and one even with as little as cup of added whole milk br br the package of six cans contained three dented cans two of them were severely on the and had to be tossed for this reason we will no longer purchase can goods through the mail ,bit of a disappointment on two , not as good as it is
i just finished my first bowl of this clam chowder and was disappointed to find or rather not find clams do not get me wrong the soup was good with a very nice texture and taste but the clams were several times i bit into something that provided a small burst of clam flavor but only once did i find a clam big enough to look at i am going to buy some chopped clams to kind of a bit this of course increases the cost of the meal i am going to try some other brands as well br br i do hope that bar harbor does some testing the label shows clams as the most prevalent ingredient but i do not see how that can be my money is on the potatos ,cannot find the , not as good as it is
i adore this chowder because it uses natural ingredients and not harmful fillers like msg and partially hydrogenated oil most importantly this chowder tastes mouth watering good and is bursting with flavor i use whole milk and add a pinch of pepper and this aromatic chowder is devoured in minutes if you have not already definitely give it a try ,best canned chowder , best ever
unless you have got a clam somewhere on your i doubt seriously that you could whip up a better bowl of chowder the clams were tender fresh plentiful and remarkably non gritty the were tasty and not overly done i would recommend that they cut back a bit on the tapioca starch and add some medium cream instead i like to add some diced onion or red bell pepper stir in some milk butter and black pepper and you are on your way to a delightful meal ,clam heaven , not as good as it is
but still not that great it is bland even when i added salt pepper milk and butter it did not taste like the best i have had but at least it is edible unlike every other canned clam chowder out there if i can find a way to make this taste better than i would love it it is the best canned clam chowder i have ever had but it is not that great the clams taste good br br edit i had a nd can and i made it today i added only a little bit of milk and i added no salt pepper or butter and it actually tastes a lot better than when i did so i suggest adding nothing but some milk or cream to this soup it is still not the best i have ever had though ,best canned clam chowder i have ever had , best popcorn ever
this soup lacks the key ingredients that make a canned clam chowder great partially hydrogenated vegetable oils soy cottonseed dehydrated potatoes modified of all kinds corn gluten msg potassium chloride sodium phosphate disodium disodium and acid what good is a classic new england clam chowder without these classic ingredients br br instead the first ingredient listed is clams next you will be telling me it is got butter in it it does oh br br on a more serious note bar harbor makes a good tasting clam chowder the first list of ingredients came from snow and campbell condensed new england clam this bar harbor stuff is worth it ,lacks key ingredients , not as good as it is
i was really excited to try clam chowder from maine but it did not wow me i think campbell might even be better ,not great not bad , not as good as it is
good flavor and not too rich fewer fat calories than the standard fare it is not loaded up with canola oil like campbell and progresso so you can add a little quality like california olive ranch or even butter for a healthier brew if you prefer it that way like we do i also add a little half and half and saute some hormel bacon bits with red onion and garlic to add complexity to the flavor i was impressed i usually also add some wild salmon frozen in most markets to basically make it a healthy fish chowder ,very good lots of and natural recipe , good but not great
one perfect box no rips tears or inside the box badly dented cans of chowder that looked like they fell out of an every single can very disappointed should i return them all is the chowder any good was this a joke i rate this star for the box ,from a , good but not great
bar harbor clam chowder is an excellent product easy to fix and has tremendous flavor nice amount of clams and potatoes you will enjoy this product very well ,bar clam chowder , great product
this arrived earlier than expected which was great however for some reason this particular product smelled a little like fish food but no worries still tasted like great cashew butter just the smell was kinda weird like fish food also i wish this product was organic ,i love butter , good but not great
big negative i have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it they are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around the mouth stains i used to buy all different flavors of iams savory sauce buy my told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face vitagravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins so if your must have some sort of gravy i recommend vitagravy a bit more or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog this creates a gravy like texture and aroma that most dogs love not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues but a great free solution for picky eaters ,decent but not great , great but not great
our dog loves this stuff i bought it for a occasional treat since he only eats dry dog food i thought it would be a nice treat for him to have a lil something extra every now and then but this stuff stinks really bad like dirt it makes the whole area where the dog eats smell like we just opened and bag of soil in the house if they could improve the smell of it that would be awesome because our dog just loves it but we cannot bare the smell of it ,dog loves this stuff but , my dog loves them
my dog likes the iams savory sauce it helps to tempt him to eat when his appetite is off and it is good for him ,my dog really likes sauce , my dog loves them
i ordered this pack of pound full leaf tea which looked like a great deal well br br st it is not lbs of tea i received only br br nd it is not high quality full leaf tea but rather the ground tea leaves you would expect from lipton br br enough i ordered the non decaf regular version and it arrived as full leaf tea and does not taste half bad if someone something different than i or rather if someone what was advertised i would like to know about it maybe i will try again ,not full leaf pound not , not as good as i like
this was the nd time that i ordered the smokehouse usa chicken the st order had usa printed right on the bag this one had a usa sticker over the china sticker in addition the product looked entirely different obviously i am concerned i pay more to ensure i am not feeding my fur kids products from china if it happens again i will stop ordering all smokehouse products on line ,chicken , great product
i had read another review and the reviewer was concerned about this product coming from china i called the manufacturer and was told this product is made here in the us my dog loves them ,made in the , not as good as it is
this is a new treat for our kids they are pretty picky eaters especially my girl they both love em glad i found this product reasonably priced too ,a favorite , great snack
i have a german breed g he is very very picky he loved them he is such a happy camper he up in the morning ready to go for his walks comes home straight to his treat cabinet he wants his chicken thank you finally something that my boy loves ,happy , great treat
with the prime shipping this made a great last minute gift it seems a little pricey for the amount of fish but the quality was good according to the person i gave it to in the end i think this is better than a fruit basket or something similar ,makes a good gift , good stuff
i think pack of for is too much per box i got them in target for less than sometimes also maybe because of promotion i got them for or around that at safeway i will not buy this one online taste is five stars but price is one star ,great cereal but too expensive yet , not as good as it is
tried grape nuts which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food though it is closer to kitty litter in texture that brings me to antioxidants br br this berry yogurt crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high fiber cereals i have eaten it is like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal the of yogurt really help but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own yes there are g of sugar per serving but the g of fiber and calorie parts more than make up for it especially if you compare it to raisin bran and shredded wheat which are typically higher in sugar and calories yet lower in dietary fiber the antioxidants are a nice bonus too br br the bottom line is that i will add this to my grocery list whenever it is on sale or the price is right ,better tasting than most healthier or high , not as good as i be
let me first say that i do not eat cereal as a general rule i just do not like it i do not drink milk ever so eating dry cereal is not always a treat i purchased a box of this for my husband i ended up trying some because it just looked so pretty in the bowl and i was hooked this cereal is tasty and healthy and i eat it everyday now with my yogurt i cannot give it enough stars ,best cereal ever , delicious
i am now on my third box of this delicious cereal i try to eat only high fiber cereals mainly for nutrition but also because they seem to be more filling this is now my favorite if you purchase the fiber plus bars many times they have a coupon on the back off one box of cereal i buy mine from wal mart and use coupon great deal usually lasts me a week i eat a bowl everyday also many times you will find a coupon on cereal box for fiber bars they are pretty good too especially the chocolate almond ,love this cereal , delicious
this has been my favorite brand of coconut water of the ones i have tried they use real fruit juice for flavoring as well as it tastes good br br we tried the smaller size and they just are not large enough to get enough water at the gym and are not resealable br br things i like about this br br perfect size for an hour long gym routine br resealable cap smaller one lacks this br tasty like a pina colada br br negative br br box makes it hard to get the last drops usually end up it up to get the last bit br br so great coconut water perfect size and cheaper than buying locally at sprouts with the amazon subscribe and save ,great coconut water in just the right size , great product
i like the slight pineapple flavor in this better than the plain coconut water good well chilled coconut water is supposed to be a healthy drink ,good taste , the best
love this juice scheduled shipment is convenient and economical this is a very expensive beverage and any way to save some money on it is worth it ,a great product and convenient , great taste
i have tried every brand of coconut water that health food stores carry and this is by far my favorite the pineapple flavor does not overwhelm the coconut or i also like the tetra pack with the screw on top it is much more convenient than the smaller oz size which you cannot reseal this has been a great gatorade substitute for me and helps a lot when i am sick or dehydrated or need to hydrate quickly great stuff ,best tasting coconut water i have found , great product
shipping great and loved product the boxes are a little tough because there is not a lid if you do not finish i suggest buy only little ones this way ,like it , great product
that is low in sugar and high in potassium whenever i am hot thirsty or a little run down i find that vita coco coconut water with pineapple really quenches my thirst me and gives me a little energy boost without added sugar or any artificial ingredients like the ones in gatorade and other drinks at electrolytes an ounce serving has only calories and mg of sodium less than fat free milk with mg of potassium and of the rda of vitamin c it is a little pricey but if you can buy it on sale with free shipping it is a great value although i have previously purchased it on amazon i more recently bought it at during gold card week when there was a free shipping offer and a buy get free offer with a deal like that it breaks down to less than cents per oz serving ,refreshing great tasting drink , not as good as you are
pineapple is hands down my favorite flavor of vita coco it not only serves a great electrolyte beverage aka the perfect cure but it can also be made into a if you just add some rum ,my favorite flavor , great taste
i really like this coconut water but i was surprised that per oz box it is the same price at wegman probably will not be ordering again unless there is some sort of discount ,just as advertised , great product
heard about this drink from a friend and had to try it had one while traveling and loved it i sat on the enjoying it i was thinking i should bought another one ,awesome tasting , good
i subscribe to this monthly but just got an email stating that it is changing from oz to oz but no price change wow that is a really lame cut to increase their profit whatever i will not miss the oz obviously but how about and your devoted consumers ,change from oz to oz , not as good as it is
i tasted the pineapple flavor yesterday at a friend cocktail party she used it to mix with rum to make pina it the drink so well the bottles are really pretty to set up and hand out at a party as well br br i have been drinking vita coco for a while now and usually drink the pure but i find the flavors to be such a treat yet still very healthy especially after a long workout ,coco , great product
it is high quality and the price is right especially with subscribe and save via prime but after months of trying to keep up with my subscription i had to put it on hold i am not a big water drinker but this stuff has a distinct flavor and when you are using it as a work out beverage four or five times a weak it eventually wears on you or me at least i would still recommend it just do not the way i did ,i was addicted to this stuff for a but out , not as good as it is
originally i was turned of by this product when i tasted the regular flavor once i had the version with i was instantly hooked i used to get a lot of stomach cramps and cramps in my feet since i have incorporated this drink daily it has aided my digestive system and all of my previous problems i would recommend vita coco to all of my friends and family ,the to all your problems , great coffee
of all the flavors vita coco produces the pineapple combination is by far the best it has just enough flavor to keep it interesting but not overpowering ,coco with pineapple the best yet , best ever
the pineapple coconut combination is refreshing i especially like that there is no added sugar this is a change from other brands ,coco , the best
i like this product so much i have it delivered monthly so happy to be drinking this at work while my co workers are stuck with pop it is so refreshing and the only coconut water flavor i like is pineapple easily and stores easily with the screw on top ,refreshing and delicious , great taste
i always feel refreshed when i drink this coconut water the pineapple gives it an added extra that makes it truly irresistible it has been a firm favorite of mine now for nearly a year ,my favorite , great product
i tried quite a few varieties of this brand and the pineapple is the best light but refreshing i am not sure if i think it is a miracle or anything but i did purchase a case and look forward to drinking this on a regular basis thank you for the great value and convenience amazon ,best flavor light but refreshing , delicious
i use vita coco coconut water with pineapple to mix with my ultra meal nutritional supplement it mixes well and taste great i have it for breakfast every morning ,cold and refreshing , great product
this product does not have the greatest taste i like coconut water but it is hard product to find i purchased this to try out and i am not liking it but it is tolerable when it is cold really cold reason why i gave it two stars i tried the coconut water when it was warm to see if it really tastes bad like some of the reviews said and sure enough they were right ,not the greatest , not as good as it is
if you have not had coconut water with pineapple juice before then you need to try this simply delicious and so healthy for you ,yummy , great product
bigger is always better and that is not what she said i did i got turned on to coconut water about a year ago and since then have not been able to get enough of it i found that vita coco is the best brand around the pineapple flavor has a great sweetness that compliments the coconut water to create a refreshing thirst quenching beverage i have recently began to drink more due to the nature of my job so i do not up in my hands plus with all the nutrients and benefits whats there not too like with subscribe and save i can quench my thirst any time of year thanks vita coco you surely have a lovely bunch of coconuts ,same great taste just more of it , best ever
i love the taste of the coco with pineapple if i was it to a common drink it is a melted virgin pina colada br the oz boxes are better for me than the other sizes because they contain the resealable lids in case you do not drink it all at once br as with all coconut waters the taste can vary slightly but the pineapple seems to keep it pretty ,best coconut water flavor and size , not as good as it is
good thirst quencher milky and thicker then i expected not what i would call a pineapple flavor but one can get the idea it is pineapple ,flavor , good but not great
i love the pineapple coconut water it is high in potassium i am a rural mail and have to be out in the hot weather in the afternoon i get hot dry and thirsty i am trying to lose weight so i am watching my calories water is wet and cold but does not quench my thirst this stuff does the trick it quenches my thirst and gives me a little pick up for the afternoon and keeps me going this only has calories per serving so that is much less than a calorie gatorade i recommend this to those looking for a healthy alternative to the sugary sports drinks ,my pick up , great product
short and brief the product has a wonderful coconut taste and the pineapple addition is light and mildly sweet i will certainly purchase this again ,coconut water with pineapple yummy , the best
i have always wanted to like coconut water low in calories high in minerals but i have just never liked the taste much the pineapple juice in this really makes a difference it still needs to be well chilled to be good but it makes a healthy post workout drink ,finally a coconut water i like , great product
i love buying these and drinking them after my workout you lose not just fluids but minerals vitamins and this helps replenish you water is good too for you too but i just love these post workout they are also good for anytime when you could use a sweet but natural drink like you do not want milk or soda or water but want something tasty and refreshing ,delicious , great product
after reading about the benefits of coconut water i decided to give this brand a try i have tried a few other brands with a juice added but they all have lot of extra sodium be sure to read the labels some have less potassium in them than the via coco brand i felt like this was better for my husband to drink than gatorade he works on a c during the summer and is out in the heat all day long ,coconut water , great taste
love the pineapple flavor makes me feel like i am on vacation drinking a pina colada you probably could add a little rum and really tastes better than other pineapple coconut waters i have tried ,yummy , great taste
this product is a good addition to fruit smoothies it thins it out while adding good taste and electrolytes which are good during the very hot weather ,good for use in , good
i love this water i started buying it after my to and now drink it whenever i feel a little dehydrated living in az i tend to not drink enough water so these help tremendously and are delicious too try them you will be hooked ,awesome , best ever
vita coco water is taste great by itself or mixed up in a smoothie it is great for re hydration after a workout and has more potassium than a banana ,coco water is awsome , best water ever
it says on the box each drink contains the of bananas more than a sports drink they might seem a little high priced but go to store buy bananas sports drinks and you will pay more to get the same nutrition you get from juice box of this coconut water ,excellent , great product
great before during and after a workout great natural electrolytes very high in potassium amazing drink this is my favorite flavor tangerine is nd ,delicious and , great taste
great real coconut young coconut taste not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks good on the environment made in brazil even better you can really taste the fruit labelled on the product besides the coconut water taste ,great taste nice fruit flavor serve , great product
not only does vita coco have the best taste much better than one br and slightly better than but now they have the best package br also br br this new screw top is great to take to the gym hiking and br br water is the best re and imo vita coco is the best br i also noticed when i searched coconut water on amazon com that br vita coco comes up number one so others seem to think that vita br coco is number one also because they are with thier purchases ,coco is best , great product
according to an article on com on the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the br at com tested the sodium potassium magnesium and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water and they found that only one zico natural contained the stated amount for all four ingredients br br the sugar and potassium content in the other two brands vita coco and o n e also matched the label but the amounts of sodium and magnesium two nutrients key to hydration were as much as and lower than the listed amount ,of this brand does not live up to what is on the , not as good as it is
i am so addicted to these you know the movie when met when i drink one of these it just feels like that famous in the movie ,so addicted , great taste
this stuff is pretty disgusting i do not care if tom or whatever invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo it tastes bad and as far as better than water umm do not think so it might replenish potassium although unless you are in the you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity ,well , not as good as it is
i had hoped that this would taste like pina but it doesn t it is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue i wanted something to drink after a work out or to give to my kids when we are traveling but it is to hard for me to swallow the reason i gave it stars is because it is good in mixed drinks i have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol if you are going to drink this straight it helps if it is really cold almost frozen if you really like the taste of coconut milk you might like this because that is the only thing i can taste in it ,yuck , not as good as it is
the product description says packs of count but when you order you only get a box of twelve i did this weeks ago talked to amazon but they still have not updated the product description ,amazon will not live up to their , great product
do not contain preservatives or additives therefore they must be properly stored all coca tea air tight bags are re with zip lock and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry cool dark place away from strong flavored foods an extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month br do not store coca tea products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside many fruits and vegetables especially if they have been damaged give off ethylene gas as they coca tea bags are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas the refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the varieties allowing it to build up to damaging levels although not to humans the ethylene gas leads to the early and rotting of the tea ,for tea , great tea
i got a bag with skin with sweet potato in the middle but my dogs like them despite the wrong item being received it is still made by the description of this product did not say anything about sweet potato in the center so unless they update the description package image i got the wrong product i am only happy because my doggies are p ,my loves them but i got a different treat , not as good as it is
these are a great snack for any dog who has food allergies to chicken my pound loves them more than any other chew or rawhide that we have given her i highly recommend these for any dog especially one with food allergies ,my them , my dog loves these
i have an old english he absolutely loved the treats it took him longer than i thought it would to eat through one so i could eat a treat in peace while he chewed on his it was great ,great treats , great product
when i placed my order it was for pigskin pack with sweet potato center when i received the order it was pigskin packs but it was all pigskin and this is not easy for my dog to chew i contacted the company and they were very nice about the hole thing as they refunded the money to my credit card and told me to take the pigskin packs to a local shelter or they were also very fast in sending out the original product they told me that they forgot to change the photo from sweet potato center to all wrapped pigskin and they would do that ,wrong product for order , my dog loves these
i emailed customer service and asked if the treats were filled with sweet potato and they assured me that they would checked with the manufacturer and confirmed that they did in fact have a sweet potato center however the ones i received did not and i feel like i was to by customer service because they did not want to take the time to actually check into it ,extremely disappointed , great product
flare sugarless gum is sugarless replacement for their big red cinnamon gum flare seems to be difficult to find in stores thanks to amazon i always have a supply flare is also the longest lasting gum i have ever experienced both in flavor and durability it is positively the best cinnamon flavor currently on the market ,my favorite flavor , great taste
i love this gum it is very that it is so difficult to find i was hooked on the cinnamon extra until that went away now this item is not available this world needs more cinnamon lovers ,love this gum , great taste
i tried this gum after trident cinnamon became hard to find a couple of years ago trident told me that they were the plant that made the gum so it was in short supply but it would be back i quickly discovered that the flare was far superior to the trident and i have not looked back it does last a long long long time as other reviewers noted it has become very hard to find in stores trident cinnamon is everywhere but now i do not want it amazon saves the day again ,best gum out there , great taste
i found this coffee flavorful and bold i did not experience bitterness br br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano br br my favorite k cups are br starbucks french roast br starbucks caffe verona br starbucks pike place roast br green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve br green mountain double black diamond br green mountain revv br green mountain dark magic br br other k cups i have tried coffee people jet fuel green mountain dark magic decaf emeril jazzed up decaf starbucks caffe verona coffee people black tiger starbucks house blend starbucks breakfast blend starbucks sumatra wolfgang puck french roast green mountain lake and lodge green mountain french roast caribou mahogony wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya emeril big easy bold ,another great green coffee , good but not great
is so good lots of flavor and great coffee taste especially good to wake up with enjoy this coffee i give it a plus ,greatest coffee , great coffee
i love how fast my cups arrived i will always get my k cups here i cannot wait to try something new ,great deal , great product
we have several of these machines at work and i have tried lots of different flavors and blends this is one of the few i can keep down without my body with an shudder lots of these instant coffees are very bitter or far too strong this one is actually very tasty ,best in for k cup french roast , great coffee
i have tried a handful of other brands of french roast and i find this one and tully version to be both great and comparable in flavor the difference is the price this one is far more reasonable ,great coffee great price , great product
i have had green mountain coffee before but had not tried the french roast i am just realizing that there is a taste difference between different manufacturers even with the same types of roasts the green mountain french roast has the flavor i like and was expecting the price was reasonable and my order shipped quickly my only disappointment was in the shipping packaging i knew that i was ordering boxes of k cups but was surprised to see how big the shipping box was there was room for boxes with the extra space filled with bubble wrap which seems wasteful to me but on the whole i am very happy with my coffee ,one of my favorite coffees , not as good as i have
this coffee has a nice bold flavor not too strong but smooth and bold enough that you know your having a full bodied cup of coffee that is really enjoyable if you like a distinctive medium bold cup of coffee you will love this ,great cup of coffee , good coffee
one of the best choices so far if you like bold coffee you will like this one will definitely buy again ,excellent choice , great coffee
i prefer stong coffee but my husband does not like it quite so strong it works well for me the way he made it work for him he makes a cup and a half and that suits him it also makes the kcup last twice as long ,green k cups , great coffee
out of i compared with side by side with tully french roast k cups these green mountain k cups do not have quite the full bodied flavor of tully both k cups are good but if you are going after a french roast with the most full spectrum and thickness of flavor then i would recommend tully french roast k cups ,green compared with french roast , not good
french roast my green mountain is my favorite every day k cup its a good coffee bold yet smooth not burnt i hate peets and starbucks because they taste like the burn the beans if you like the nasty burnt taste these probably are not for you if you want a well balanced bold smooth everyday coffee these k cups will work ,my favorite k cup , good coffee but not a great price
this is great french roast for whatever reason it is also cheaper in count than the other green mountain coffee roasts ,this is great french roast , great product
i find many k cups are weak and not what i am used to starbucks but this french roast is a pretty good to the coffee i get from the store ,love this coffee , good coffee
if you love super dark rich bold and thick flavored coffee then this is the coffee for you with one problem personally i love coffee that everything i just said i love and the like to find a k cup that is this bold even on the oz setting is great but there is that problem again br br it smells tastes and leaves the after taste of burnt urine like someone a public and the floor with coffee then packaged it yum br br there are other dark bold k cups out there that have a better smell flavor and does not have a nasty after taste you may not believe me and that is fine but get a sample pack before going for the you will thank me later try the green mountain coffee extra bold sumatran reserve k cups better all around cup of coffee ,tastes like , not a fan
a href http www amazon com gp product b f z peanut butter cookie crisps calorie packs count boxes pack of a these cookies are so tasty i love the peanut taste and the crispness a one hundred calorie pack is just enough to get started having fun eating them but then the of the size of the package helps me put the on probably the most important part of weight control is portion control br br the cookies have grams fat mg cholesterol and weight watchers points ,yummy cookies , delicious
it is very nice that the company put calories packages out great marketing idea they taste okay to me a bit subtle on the chocolate mostly they are lightly flavored chocolate wheat crackers they have very little nutritional value but over sugar the calories is achieved by a very light product it does not weigh much so calories sounds great but only if you eat but one package not easy to do if you are hungry still it is a convenient snack to put in a backpack lunch box carry on now that they do not feed you much when you fly etc with less calories than most alternatives could also tide you over between meals still i would personally prefer something a bit healthier but that is why there is chocolate vanilla they left out the vanilla ,snack for a non , not as good as i be
i enjoy them a lot and so does my son i have to say that this kind is one of my favorites it is full of peanut butter flavor that you forget that it is only cals as for the amount you get in the bag it is more than i expecting so i was very happy ,peanut butter cookies , great taste
i enjoy the peanut butter cookie crisp but they are definitely a from the originals still my son loves them so for this reason i still give it four stars ,good buy , delicious
inside the box you buy this makes them even more portable for both children and adults another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre measured to contain only calories this way you cannot accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have br br i notice that these crackers are made with cocoa please your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that br br i recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack they should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy they make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and or cholesterol br br buy some and enjoy them today smiles ,the and edible oreo , great for a great price
i really like these they are so light and airy almost like chips instead of cookies the flavor is that yummy oreo chocolate we all know and love ,very good snack , great chips
these are good but the flavor did not resemble an oreo i purchased these along with the chips ahoy and those did resemble the flavor of chips ahoy in my opinion these tasted like animal crackers i will stick to chips ahoy calorie packs ,these are ok , good chips
i have been eating the calorie chip ahoy for sometime i really find that it is a filling guilt free snack it has a unique taste of its own not a diet food type taste either it taste like a real snack ,very good , good
oreo thin crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the oreo name br br of course you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy but where is the fun in that for those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun and yet the thought of out on a pound of oreos of chunks of fat floating through our system oreo thin crisps are a lovely alternative or course you probably should avoid eating pounds of these even with the reduced fat food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you even if it tastes good at least oreo thin crisps do not talk to me when i walk by br br enjoy ,flavor in calories down fat out , i love these
the chocolate wafers without the white cream but they are lighter in taste than that even without having the glass of milk handy that i considered essentially when eating the more traditional oreo cookies since they do have the oreo taste i can round up on these these come in calorie packs to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake you can six oz g packs in a oz box each pack contains grams of trans fat grams of fat and milligrams of cholesterol you will also find one of healthy living tips on the front of the pack e g make a meal out of or side dishes instead of larger main of course i was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit ,now we have the oreo into a baked chocolate snack , good but not great
with any low fat or low calorie food you are going to sacrifice taste of portion size with this product you sacrifice both br br it a good idea which was done well with the oreos and others in this series of calorie snacks but i think you are better off with a single cookie from the regular chips ahoy box than a whole bag of these ,not as good as the calorie , good chips but not as good as you are
love this snack br its really tasty br filling for my wife not me though i ll take please ,great taste , delicious
this stuff all about enriched flour sugar artificial flavors artificial colors a little canola oil br br grams of fat grams of sugar in a gram package calories br br bottom line no simple lean sugar wafer with the usual additives br br as diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you one can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand making them a sort of or against dropping energy and blood sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large snack for that purpose this is a great product and i know that our years ago would have given anything to have these wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he on for many a long afternoon when the did not find any saltines around the office he would head straight for mcdonalds and the rest was history ,these are true diet snacks , love it
her at the beginning of a star is born the oreos because she had two back up who were black that is why the idea of an oreo thin crisp is rather lost on me br br it is a single sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a wheat thin than the original oreo it does have some of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a tribute do not get me wrong as the oreo thin crisps are perfectly fine as low calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go they simply lack the lip satisfaction of a disassembled oreo digested in pieces the whole point of the ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are calorie packs a fine idea for weight watchers and the rest of us who should be watching our weight it is just that i do not feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack ,chocolate in an as but if helps calories why not , good but not as good as i like
nabisco knew if they didnt put little things that give this much pleasure in little we would keep dipping our hand in the bag and in a couple years would all weigh lbs die an early death and no longer be able to give nabisco money br br kidding aside these are the texture is perfection if you feel like chewing them quickly or take it slowly and let the light wafer melt in your mouth ,oreo crisps , good for you
i was disappointed in these cookies they are pretty tasteless and damn hard too i would not buy them again and i have certainly tasted much better low cal cookies i definitely recommend saving your money folks ,not the best cookies i have ever had , not as good as
when you have a craving for a sweet but you do not will not too much this bar is just perfect it is yummy ,yummy , great taste
i do not usually like really crispy cookies but the taste of these changed my mind i like that you get quite a few for only calories i often go for quantity over quality so i would rather have a few thin crisp cookies than one regular cookie ,very yummy , good but not great
these are our favorite indulgence at calories for a sweet fix and energy they are the best sad to see on amazon they are no longer available br quick shipping and they arrived safely ,oreo delight bars , great taste
these cookies are just enough when you crave a sweet little snack my yr old granddaughter likes to say the letter br before she pops it in her mouth ,cookies , great snack
these calorie cakesters are delicious both the vanilla br and the chocolate are great they satisfy those little sweet br cravings and its only calories for three little cakes ,calorie , great
let me begin by saying that i do not like oreo cookies at all i think the cookie part is bitter and i hate the white cream filling when a friend suggested i try these i was reluctant and kept telling her that i was not interested she so i tried a few and surprisingly did not find them to be bad at all i am diabetic so this is not a snack i will be eating often but a few here and there will not hurt if you are expecting these to taste like oreo cookies i m one who is glad they didn t then you will be disappointed but if you want a chocolate snack that is low in calories and fat please give these a try ,they are not bad , not as good as i have
growing up on oreos and milk is common so i was taken with the brand extension of oreo to cakesters and while i had low expectations i must say these are better than normal oreos although i cannot say it will beat the combo of oreos and milk these are fantastic treats and relatively guilt free if you like cake and like oreos you cannot go wrong with oreo cakesters br br the filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new oreo experience certainly worth a try guaranteed enjoyment ,fantastic little treats , my favorite dog treat
i have recently as i need to lose some weight and these calorie pack cookies are the greatest thing for snacks i appreciate the opportunity to get them from you so reasonably i have agreed to take a shipment each month ,calorie pack chips cookies , good
i loved the original oreo cakesters when they first but i away from eating them on a regular basis because of the high calorie and fat content in each serving so when i saw the commercial for the calorie version i could hardly wait to try them and i must say i am very impressed br br while some of the calorie snack cakes can have a dry consistency these cakes are moist decadent and taste like the originals just smaller i would recommend them to anyone who liked the original version but is watching calories good job nabisco ,great calorie treat , great taste
my family is on the last box my oldest daughter ate most of the cookies she likes peanut butter more than anything and these calorie pouches had just the right amount and they taste great ,good and just enough to you , great snack
these are more like a cracker good for a little fill in for between meals ,good snack , good
chips ahoy cookies were not very tasty my children and husband would not eat them i tried to give them away and everyone refused ,cookie chips were not very tasty , great chips
such an easy way to buy calorie controlled snacks the arrived quickly so easy to take to work or when you need just an easy snack ,good snacks , great snack
i absolutely love the oreo thin crisps cookies a href http www amazon com gp product b f z oreo thin crisps calorie packs count boxes pack of a they taste great and satisfy my chocoholic craving without compromising my diet ,oreo thin crisps calorie packs , delicious
of all the calorie pack snack products i have tried and there have been many these are my absolute favorites the funny thing is that i do not even like oreos and am not that crazy about chocolate however these thin crisps are exactly that thin and crisp they are also just right to off sweet cravings or hunger ,oreo thin crisps work for me , good but not great
they melt in your mouth i think i found my perfect snack br i love oreos but hate all the fat they provide to my diet by diet i mean the ability to eat everything in moderation i how much fat i ingest for many reasons health being the most important one package of these cookies had the same great taste of oreos with only of the fat br i also like the fact that they come in individual packages they do not go stale you can take them on trips movies park etc br great tea or coffee cookies too and of course good old milk ,yummy , great snack
gp product b a a star is born a the oreos because she had two back up who were black that is why the idea of an oreo thin crisp is rather lost on me br br it is a single sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a wheat thin than the original oreo it does have some of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a tribute do not get me wrong as the oreo thin crisps are perfectly fine as low calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go they simply lack the lip satisfaction of a disassembled oreo digested in pieces the whole point of the ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are calorie packs a fine idea for weight watchers and the rest of us who should be watching our weight it is just that i do not feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack ,chocolate in an as but if helps calories why not , good but not as good as i like
dude these things are pretty good as long as you are not bent on them being just like oreos i mean they are not but i definitely like them better than other chocolate cracker snacks like the lightness of the crackers makes them perfect for on other goodies like peanut butter cream cheese icing pudding melted chocolate ,i am a fan , good but not great
these are great snacks for traveling such as by or car the cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker the cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble and for this reason a preferred treat br br the texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat the first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is these are good this is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time ,oreo flavored crackers without the creme , great taste
sorry but i was not terribly impressed by these light snack crackers okay i admit that i never liked oreos that much in the first place this calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like oreos for sure minus the sugar high in the traditional sandwich cookie filling but as one other reviewer noted they are not all that chocolaty a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic worse than that they are not so good for you if you are going to have calories there are a lot healthier ways to do so than nearly percent to sugar for my money a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense it not only costs less it is got lots more nutritional value not to mention ,not impressed , not as good as i be
who does not love oreo cookies many of us well remember after school snacks of oreo cookies and milk however also for many of us those school days when we could eat all we wished and not gain an ounce are in the past so it is a special treat that brings back all kinds of good memories to find oreo thin crisps br br no i was not one who pulled the cookie apart to the frosting i just loved the chocolatey taste and that is all in these cookies less the cals they are crispy crunchy chocolate wafers a wonderful comfort snack br br a high five for oreo thin crisps br br ,crispy crunchy and , good but not great
ate two packages of them i even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too i am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me i think the nabisco oreo mini cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you do not want to br br if i have any complaint about the nabisco oreo mini cakesters it would be that they are too small but since that is actually part of their appeal i do not consider their small size a problem br br i do recommend nabisco oreo mini cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you ,delicious mini chocolate treats help weight , not a good snack
i love oreos but hate the filling these prevent me from having to the filling out and they are good for you calorie wise ,delicious , delicious
these things are nothing like oreos you think wow oreos think again i would say spend your money on something better the hershey or crisp wafer bars come to mind my honest view on these thin crisps cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a wafer or milk bones ,i agree with p , not as good as it is
to be honest with you i got these at a store you think wow chocolate chips and oreos think again for those that think these are so good i would recommend the hershey or crisp wafer bars my honest view on these thin crisps cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a wafer or milk bones ,good you cannot be , great chips
these things are low cal oreo minus the creme minus the cookie the title oreo is basically a total these are nothing but black crackers with some sugar if that is what you want then click purchase ,these is not oreo , not as good as
these arrived in the middle of may and they have an expiration date of the first week of july this means i have to eat a lot of these in the next few weeks just beware if you are planning on stocking up for the future the future will get here very soon with these br br it also interesting that the box inside the amazon box says for internal use only i am not sure what that is about ,good product but not fresh , not as good as it is
they all taste really good it comes in mango strawberry and red bean they are each individually wrapped so you only have to eat one at a time there are of each flavor as well when i finish this canister i plan on buying another ,i love these , good
well when i bought this item i thought it would be a direct japan import it is br it was bought at costco and the price label was still the product br br the product can be bought at costco for half the price if not less br br the expiration date was not printed on the product which makes me think it was expired br i believe this as most of the mochi is dry and tough br br will shy away from this product ,not so great , not as good as it is
i got this after a mention in the ny times and immediately became an addict it is a little hot but not too much and it has an amazing depth of flavor a lot more than the plain version i use it in chicken salad to cut back on the amount of mayo to add flavor to blah soups and as a substitute for a lot of the oil in salad dressings a little bit over steamed veggies and added to yogurt over baked potatoes instead of sour cream is also great ,amazing , the best
my aged cat has a very sensitive stomach and she cannot eat most cat foods available however she has no problems with this not once in all the months i have been feeding her this has she ever vomited in any way not to mention she is acting healthier and seems stronger on this brand br br and she easily eats this dry without having to add any wet food to make it palatable she clearly likes the taste br br all in all i highly recommend this to anyone with a senior cat ,worked very well , cat cat food
i do not know why science diet is being referred to as junk food as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market a lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be but regardless my veterinarian wanted me to put my year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine after some comparisons science diet mature adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food both my cats the younger one and the older are on this food and they seem to enjoy it they both all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to them my younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy ,keeps my cats happy and healthy , my cat loves it
this comes in a case of so i bought one can locally before ordering the large amount good move i have cats and none of them would eat it this review is for the mature gourmet beef entree have not tried the other favors yet ,all of my cats to eat it , great product
it is as best it can be there are still on the side that allow air in to the product br br packaging is important it is no better for your pet to live on stale oxidized food than it would be for you oxidized fats are also called rancid if you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human well you get the idea this is about more than just br br i am this review for all the science diet products with this kind of packaging if you have had the same experience as me with this product please take the time to let this company know about it br br i love my animal i want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him but this quite literally the worst reseal that i have ever had the to br br ,the worst ever made , great product
only cup in total she was eating three times a day of a cup in total now she eats some in the morning walks away eats some more a few hours later and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding no more knocking things over no more dad papers on the desk no more no more deliberately spilled water on the floor it is incredible br br i feel so bad that i was doing this to her for so long we really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever but no she was hungry because she was not eating any real food br br do your cat a favor buy her or him so food made with real ingredients things you would eat wellness halo innova evo whatever figure it out for yourself but please do not feed your cat this it is garbage ,food is leaves your cat always more , great product
this is the perfect food for my cat in fact the only one she will eat wet or dry ,loves it , great product
i am very disgusted with science diet they are the public with the nutritional claims on the bags one of the sites i researched on for chronic renal failure has the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available if you compare the various science diet formulae that have different health claims on them the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive with other brands such as innova or royal canin there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae br br now to deal with the weight gain as well as the other problems we noted we are switching foods again this time we are trying royal canin indoor mature wish us luck ,kitty food , my dog loves it
although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced the cans say it is minced but it isn t it is ground beef my cat only likes minced not chunks not ground although she will eat ground cat food sometimes it has to be and delicious yet she just walks away from this br br i hate it when the packaging about the contents of a product the shipping was speedy and the value is great as long as they deliver what the promise now i am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all ,not this is ground beef , not as good as it is
i ordered this because it is science diet and it says it is minced well it is not minced and my cats do not like it it is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they cannot eat it i am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too will not be buying it again returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so i would be losing money ,not , not as good as it is

diet is for superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find do not let your vet fool you either vets usually get a cut from hill to sell you their cat food br br my recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research try brands like newmans own or castor and pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record br br i later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals science diet as it is donated and they have a special with petsmart to house their animals in their in store a requirement is to exclusively feed science diet to the animals br br try this instead a href http www amazon com gp product b castor pollux indoor feline dry cat food pound bag a ,all by product corn do not waste your money , not like it
a friend brought a bag of this tea back from a trip to and shared it with his coworkers i was amazed when i drank my first cup the best word to describe the mouth feel is buttery it is a wonderful clear and elegant tasting tea i have never had anything like it and cannot wait for it to become available everyone he shared it with wants to buy some a japanese friend who has been drinking green tea all her life said it was a special experience to taste this tea please offer it soon ,best green tea ever , best tea ever
sent this as a gift and found out later that many items were stale they loved the thought though and loved the way it looked ,looks better than it tasted i am , best ever
best coffee i have ever tasted br br my wife neighbors and friends are all crazy over jamaican me crazy br br you must try it ,wow , great coffee
i love coffee anytime of day but i drink coffee during afternoon and evening hours and a flavored coffee is a real treat but some can be overpowering this jamaican me crazy flavor not only suits my personality ha it is very pleasing to the palate the flavoring is very subtle while allowing the full flavor of the coffee to be enjoyed and oh the aroma is delicious both while grinding the beans and brewing the coffee i will definitely purchase this again ,i love love love coffee , great coffee
pounds would have been way too much the flavor was excellent just enough of bite the creaminess of the cheese really came through and was a perfect balance i broke up the half wheel into and a tray with a effect of broken pieces it was all well received with the choices of red wine there was more than enough which has allowed me to enjoy the flavors for other favorite dishes for a couple of more weeks i am looking forward to ordering this again super bowl is right around the corner it is big so make sure you can carry and store this quantity as far as cost i thought it was a great deal since it seemed to have much less rind than what we purchase elsewhere the cost per pound may be average but the amount of actual usable cheese is there with the great flavor ,heaven , i love it
absolutely delicious have tried it on everything from meat and fish to scrambled eggs highly recommend it ,fantastic product , delicious
i did not know anything about chutney until i went on a known recipe and found out that they mix the fruit with peppers and vinegar i thought chutney was a different form of but i was wrong ,not happy with the product , not as good as it is
i have started the extraction process less than a month ago and so far it looks and smell wonderful waiting to try it i have put oz in of vodka and now have a beautiful brown fluid that as i stated earlier smells wonderful i plan on using the other oz in some homemade vanilla frozen icecream etc ,these beans were wonderful , great taste
bought these for me for christmas i used to work with a guy who would bring still warm home roasted peanuts to work after he left i wanted to try it myself these were great minutes in the oven with one stir and they are done they taste better than any grocery store peanuts ever could i might shell some of them and try honey roasting too i see a lot of people boil them what are boiled peanuts like you do not see them up here in and i have never tried them ,great , good but not great
same great taste as the tea bags but so much more green thank you for packaging this in bulk ,much better than tea bags , great tea
we use this in place of sugar for almost everything it has a light flavor sort of similar to honey without the and the strong flavor the best part is the lack of sugar and due to its lower glycemic index ,love this stuff , great product
i was truly amazed at how great this product is the flavor is everything that you can expect from a sweetner that is this pure i will be ordering it again and i will try the other flavors as well ,totally satisfying , not as good as
cookie part tastes like all the other crappy store bought soft cookies out there br br in contrast entenmann original recipe chocolate cookie is a mind experience delicious dark chocolate chips and a soft mouth watering cookie with a unique but taste they seem to have the ratio of flour to sugar so that the cookie is delicious without you down with excessive sugary sweetness this is again in contrast to their horrible new cookies br br i have absolutely no idea why entenmann decided to nearly eliminate their sales of the recipe and replace it with these disgusting brands it seems to have happened when the entenmann name was bought by a larger company so it was probably a money saving opportunity the original recipe cookies likely have expensive ingredients br br the only problem is they are so hard to find thank goodness they are now on amazon ,store bought cookies very hard to find , delicious and delicious and
i received this box with great anticipation since they do not sell these on the west coast i got the package opened the box and was extremely disappointed the cookies looked like a the box to death and left most of the box filled with crumbs and there was a rodent sized hole on the side of the box so needless to say i will not not be reordering these again ,awful , not as good as it is
i found wild many years ago and have continued to use their products the lemon salad is my favorite salad dressing it is light now cal and very tasty excellent on any green or pasta salad and especially good on fresh heirloom tomatoes with fresh slices yum their customer service is excellent and helpful and the site some great recipes as well i am a fan ,love this dressing wild products lemon dressing , great product
the shipping was very fast but so was the expiration date got it on expiration is april only weeks before it who can eat so much seaweed in such a short time i should have returned it but who wants to go through all the trouble well i stuffed it all in the freezer and hope it will be still that is what you get when you order food online i will not order it again ,almost , not as good as it is
i have purchased these though a local source for four dollars for a pack of eight if you are not sensitive to msg then these are a delicious alternative to other salty snacks the seasoning is tasty and the thin sheets of seaweed are lite and crispy i eat them two or three packs at a time calories per love them ,and crispy , great for
i was disappointed when i received this shipment as the seaweed contains msg and it is not listed as an ingredient br amazon was very and refunded me the amount of purchase ,contains msg , not as good as it is
my little ones love seaweed and rice and this seaweed did not disappoint br other brands are too oily or salty or not enough this one though is just right br i would be buying it again and again ,and rice , great product
great for sushi or for use with korean bob or maybe just as a snack lightly salted great crunch and will support rice beef pork even fish br or a vegetable or two ,great for , great for
i found this stuff to be very tasty great with jasmine rice or just as a snack i do not mind a little msg if it enhances the flavor ,tasty , delicious
this coffee was really good been trying to find it in new york but have not been able to i think it is worth the few extra bucks to get it delivered i have ordered twice now and each time the coffee comes fresh and still very aromatic also i think the caffeine content is pretty high as i am more awake on this brand then other brands like starbucks and fairway market brands ,hard to find in new glad amazon can it , good coffee but not a great price
my local walmart and target both have this ground or whole bean at a regular price of less than per oz bag it is way overpriced here br br it is an excellent coffee i am drinking it as i write this an interesting hint of creamy citrusy taste that is dark but without the burnt aftertaste that comes with many dark roasts ,star for price stars for taste , not as good as the
this is my family favorite brand of wheat free gluten free cake mix this brand is moist tasty and closer to the traditional cake mixes people are used to products are the best in my opinion of what is available out there in health food stores try it you will not be disappointed ,best tasting wheat free gluten free cake mix available , great product
i ordered this thinking it would be a yellow cake mix it is a heavy cake and is brown that said it comes in handy to make coffee cake upside down cake and other recipes because it is a basic mix and in those recipes the is not a problem plain cake though was disappointing so get creative instead ,gluten free mix , not as good as it is
i made cupcakes with the vanilla cake mix they were just ok they were dense but not overly so so that was not too bad the flavor however is where i was disappointed the vanilla flavor was so subtle that i missed it entirely and i felt like there needed to be a little more sweetness which probably would have also made them a bit more moist the child i made them for only ate a few bites ,could have been better , not as good as it is
i tried vanilla cake mix and pizza crust mix and was in both they had a medicinal bitter taste and even smelled strange i threw both items away ,flavor , great taste
i added tbsp of sugar and half tsp of pure vanilla and a pinch of free baking powder and coconut oil for oil and it came out soo good my son loved it i liked it too the fact that it is all the major allergens free makes it better ,awesome with some , great product
excellent for gf not bad on it is own but i have used it as a basis for coconut cake pineapple upside down cake cake and others ,a cake for all , good but not great
i think gluten free spice cake mix is their best but vanilla cake is pretty good too i especially like it with whipped cream and strawberry sauce with a dash of ground orange peel in my oven the mix bakes better in muffin cups or a muffin pan than in a pan ,foods gluten free vanilla cake mix , great product
i have made these twice in cupcake form topped with red jam and powdered sugar of course it does not taste like a normal vanilla cake more grainy in texture with a subtle sweetness and some spice br but i think they are super tasty they did not suffer from the weird chewy texture i often run into with rice flour based mixes also used egg replacer with no problem ,yummy as , not as good as it is
i used this mix to make a x cake in a glass pan using oil spring water and free range eggs i thought the cake had a nice flavor to it but it was not what i was expecting i was craving a white cake like wedding cake and went to my local store to find something wheat free gluten free and dairy free i purchased this vanilla cake mix i think it is a very good mix i could not really taste the vanilla flavor but thought it had a nice flavor the cake is yellow dense but not like a pound cake and texture y like brown rice has more texture than white rice i thought the sweetness was just right i think i would purchase again but would make pineapple upside down cake with it ,tasty , not as good as it is
this mix allowed my little one to have cupcakes at his second birthday party they turned out great and with some homemade vanilla icing they were a hit with everyone i even used ener g egg replacer to replace the multiple eggs the mix calls for one hint bake for almost the maximum time on the directions they come out golden brown and moist ,nd , great product
the chocolate cake is fantastic so i had reason to think that this would be as well not the case it was very dense tasteless totally unlike the airy tasty chocolate br i want my money back or an even exchange for the chocolate cake mix ,just awful , not as good as it is
this tea is hard to find it was a joy to find it on amazon br br large package full size boxes arrive all for enjoyment br br sugar plum is a delicious sweet warm feel good tea reminding you of christmas it has that spice palate of warm hibiscus barley rosehips i think what i like most of all is the sweet aromatic taste one of those tastes that makes you feel taken care of a special treat when you are little like when mom or dad would make you hot coco or something you like that was so sweet and rare and only on those special br br i adore this tea and rather drink tea br i am so happy to have found it ,delicious tea , not as good as i be
this tea makes me sleep better than sleepy time tea the taste is also pretty good i make mine very concentrated br with less than ounces of hot water and i cover the mug top with a plate and wrap a around the whole thing br and let it sit for as long as i can before i drink it ,sweet , not as good as it is
this tea smells and tastes like christmas this has always been my family favorite tea for children and big kid tea parties ,the best for a winter tea party , great tea
i began purchasing this tea years ago and looked forward to it each year for the past two years i was unable to locate it in my local stores so i was elated to find it at amazon it tastes like cinnamon and red candy apples to me i love it ,wonderful , great tea
so glad to have found this tea it my absolute holiday favorite thanks for the fast shipping too ,love the tea , great tea
the package celestial seasonings take a sip of sugar plum spice and journey with us to the land of the sweets in the here you will find gingerbread houses trees laden with sugar plums and days filled with this is the land of the sugar plum who is beautiful gentle and kind we created this tea to pay tribute to her sugar plum spice is made with natural herbs and the flavors of plum and spice with just a hint of sweetness this tea is slightly sweet and full bodied tasting just as you would expect from the description the cardamom and ginger give it a little zing each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and i only need to use one at a time br br i recommend it even if it is not a holiday it is perfect for a cold or wet winter day br br ,fun tea , good tea but
it is hard to rate tea it is very good tea but tea nonetheless however the company that sells this particular tea was very nice to deal with they shipped the tea very quickly i will most likely buy from them again when the need ,fast shipping good company to buy from , great tea
the fortune cookies were shipped immediately and were packed well i e none arrived broken the cookie was delicious and the fortunes were classic chinese and not the modern version ,a very pleased customer , good but not great
my daughter kindergarten class chinese new year and we were in charge of providing the fortune cookies this company had a prompt delivery and the cookies were a great success her teacher commented on how funny the fortunes were for the ,great cookie and lots of fun , great snack
i brought these cookies as a dish to pass at my family christmas get together they were a hit the cookies were fresh and unbroken packaging was well done and delivery was prompt my sisters had fun with the fortunes by adding the phrase while in bed after reading each fortune br br i will use the amazon vendor house of rice again ,in bed , good snack
the cookies were kind of but other than that it was fast shipping and good packing the cookies were not broken ,cookies , great snack
the cookie is crispy good and flavorful the fortunes are not the shallow ones we are seeing lately be patient even in time an egg will walk i received the quantity and quality i ordered ,crispy fresh , good but not great
i was expecting these cookies were going to be normal size but i was wrong i was planning on dipping them in chocolates but they r not those average size at all so disappointed i now have to go out n find the normal size cookies what a waste of money i also needed but of them were broken they do not put fragile on the box outside ,they are , good but not great
i ordered these fortune cookies as rewards for my students each time they passed a test to go along with the theme fortunately we know our math facts the majority of the cookies arrived still in tact i understand that with shipping there are bound to be a few broken cookies i am very please with the product and the customer service i will definitely be ordering again in the future and will make sure i refer my family and friends to this business ,excellent service and product , great for
this is the second time i have ordered this product i was happy enough the first time to place an order again cookies were fine and delivery was very quick thank you ,cookies , great snack
well packed few are broken but it is the cookies are tasty and the notes are interesting my friends and i really enjoyed it ,very good , good but not great
great product fast shipment the food product tasted great none of the fortune cookies where opened i would buy again from this seller ,awsome , great for
i bought these as a gift for my sister i was so excited to see that they arrived in great condition my sister loved them ,perfect , great taste
these cookies were a big hit at our new year eve dinner everyone enjoyed reading their fortune each time we arrived at another house they really kept the party moving ,satisfied customer , great snack
this is a great product however you can buy it in a in ny for on th and i am my review because amazon me the profile name animals i was only stating a fact about what a rip off the site is in the future please do not call me a that is not nice you stupid ,great product but a off on this , not as good as it is
bought as a christmas present smells like a milk shake i might have to try it might make a coffee drinker out of me ,great aroma and i do not like coffee , good coffee
i bought this for my sister for christmas she loved it but was afraid she would eat all of it at once so she took the box to work within hour it was finished by all her ,yummy , great product
this tastes just like o green life it is a hard sweet crunchy ring with a minty flavor that pretty much describes it it is a crunchy mint shaped like a ring ,tastes like o green life , great taste
wrap or any type of wrapping around the individual packages before they put it into the box they choose a small box that can barely fix all twenty packages it is to the point that the box is no longer but rounded somewhat the service does not treat the package with care so when it arrived there was a wet stain when we opened it two packages had been damaged and the butter leaked all over all the other packages we had to spend a long time washing all the packages because they are all greasy the does not wash off easily even with soap now when eating them some of the other packages of popcorn got water in them because of the washing they are not air tight packages so when popping them there are a lot of unpopped kernels they should use bigger boxes and wrap it better ,good popcorn poor shipping , great product
might not notice it but let it sit in your mouth a bit before and then take another sip the more you drink it the more it will become apparent it is very soothing to the br br golden oolong from tea company it a good if not great tea especially for the price and quantity you get a solid every day drinker it is not as complex as some that i have had but that could be due to how long ago it was harvested and a number of other conditions depending on how you brew it a serving of these leaves is good for before the flavor making it an even better value and even then the broth is soft and sweet br br if you like your more on the green side then you should give it a try i know i will be ordering another tin ,it is like , not bad but not bad
them onto salad or mix with rice quinoa or beans br br here the nutrition off the back for oz cup at the time of writing br br calories from fat br total fat g br cholesterol mg br sodium mg br total carb g br protein g br omega dha mg br br you really cannot beat this for something so portable that requires no preparation or the package says in water but there is a little bit of broth in the cup and if you squeeze this out or just leave it at the bottom of the cup you probably cut the sodium down to mg br br i highly recommend these tuna cups and the salmon cups as well but avoid the tuna salad or the flavored varieties if you are looking to get the maximum nutritional benefit those salads and flavorings just add salt sugar carbs ,awesome snack great product , good for you
although i prefer to get my tuna in the foil packages what i had ordered appears to no longer be available through amazon so i tried these and they are handy and pretty goo eating for one toss on a salad or use on bread or toast to add good quality protein ,handy size , great for
cats are such finicky eaters some times my old lady kitty does not like the canned cat foods but she always went nuts whenever i would open a can of tuna for myself so i gave her some one time these tuna cups are a great way to keep the tuna fresh enough over a few days and good for travel br br same items can be purchased at grocery store but buying in quantity through amazon saves some thank you ,my cats love this , cat cat cat food
the sea white tuna cups fill the bill put one in the lunch with a few fresh fruit and veggie items and perhaps a few dried fruits and nuts it is good nutrition and there is no worry about weight gain also when i am camping i like to take a batch of these tuna cups along in both cases the cup size just the right for one serving br br i had a minor problem with the latest tuna cups and it might be just a batch problem my latest tuna was very dry i almost had to choke it down and it seemed rather tasteless i have had these cups in the past and they seemed much better i have not been satisfied with the present ones however i like the product and the serving size and it will not me from future purchases br br gary peterson ,good nutrition and right size , good but not great
i keep a stack of these tuna cups at work along with lemon juice and teriyaki sauce for variety they are low calorie satisfying and nutritious i am sold on them now buy in bulk and keep on hand all the time ,convenient calories and lots o protein great work lunch item , great taste
if you want the best wild rice buy the regular kind this quick cook type is not near the taste quality of the regular minute cook time rice ,quick wild rice is ok , best ever
this is the best one bob red mill does not hold a candle to this it is fluffy delicious and does not stick to the pan br i use water to rice yum ,best quick wild rice , best ever
i like to put wild rice in many dishes this is a good buy and easy to drop into other rice dishes or soups ,great quality and convenient quick cooking , great product
special here br br carrying bag oh my gosh a for this carrying bag the bag has one long skinny section for the posts and a separate snap off zipper for the other components within the smaller bag there are separate and holders for each piece no more of stuff i love it one one of the step in posts had the bag during packing or shipping the bag is made of pretty heavy duty but not quite heavy duty enough to stand up to a pointed spike and the ends of the bag are not to avoid this problem br br all in all this portable fence kit is about as good as any i have seen and would be a reasonable choice for anyone wanting a camping corral just do not expect it to contain horses unless you are those horses in and out one at a time ,very good for maybe with , not as good as i be
fence to avoid any problems with not very practical when out on the road br br planning the fence was harder than i imagined because i could not make a perfect square and i thought i had measured correctly but still fell short of where i wanted the fence to end i then discovered that i was only given feet of polytape rather than the feet doing a trial run of setting the fence up is recommended br br i wanted something that was easy i am a small middle aged female and needed something that was not too much trouble so i could move it around without a lot of sweat and tears this is perfect for my goat situation if they had just sent me the correct length tape it seems too short for horses but i posted the measurements in case it helped someone who has horses ,easy and but a issues , not as good as i be
this product is both effective and convenient we were able to assemble it and have it working within minutes it worked great as a for our and her new we were able to give them some private time while not feeling as though they were separated from the i highly recommend this product and will have many uses for it in the future please view our pictures we have provided in the customer photo section ,easy great for , great product
quite a match for the on the posts a little bigger hook or some sort of metal would be nice to give a sense of a more secure still you are counting on the fence never being touched so it is not a big problem br br the bag for the kit is amazing everything fits inside beautifully with even a special pocket for the instructions it is easy to carry and extremely i was very impressed to see the thought and effort put into the bag which makes the kit much easier to use and deal with than just a pile of fence parts the bag is big enough that there is room for extra items in both the long post compartment and the smaller bag section br br this is a very nice and handy kit to have around if you have quiet horses that respect electric fence ,thought out for , good but not great
have around in the event that we need a temporary corral for a couple horses once set up it will not hold more than two of our horses i do not think we would ever try and manage to get inside like the product advertises br br the instructions were surprisingly simple and it set up easily between myself and my husband working on it i can see how this would be great to have for other animals as well such as but we only have need for it with the horses and have had success in containing them the step in posts are fantastically designed the overall design makes the fence very versatile setting up easily pretty much anywhere your horse an go br br we re very happy with it is design and portability and will get a lot of good use out of this system i think ,easy nice , a great product
and two d cell batteries which i promptly put in a safer place so they could not accidentally contact material and br br this proved easy enough to set up in an area that is clear of tall brush that could cause trouble when contacting the live tape properly set up the batteries did not drain of course i carried extras i also chose to guy the corners which i am used to with of course i had to bring extra rope and stakes for that purpose no problem br br this worked for one not huge horse who is trained to electric so she does not challenge them sure any of her size could easily break out but i would want her to if in danger no i cannot see how the stated or horses could be contained in this but this a solution on the trail for my ,works for us , great product
got this to take along on backpacking trips with the horses it works fine for that purpose the size is perfect and worked like a charm the two horses did not attempt a at least br br easy to put up and easy to take down along with the portability makes this a camping winner ,great for , great product
i do not have horses so i am not using this in the traditional way br br our backyard is being and all the are down with a there though covered i was concerned about the etc so this came in handy and it was so easy to set up ,it is very easy to up , not as good as it is
this is a great temporary fence for or horses it is kinda and you may need a little help setting it up if you are a smallish person but it works great after setup ,good , not as good as
i bought this color for a cake of the cup that i made i was using this color for the very first time and i have to say that it was perfect i was afraid that the silver would be too dark or but it had a sheen and was exactly what i was hoping for ,love it , not as good as it is
this is the first time i have found a us produced truffle oil that actually contains real truffle a lot of other truffle oils just have truffle aroma whatever that is and a lot of chemicals that sound less than pleasant you can definitely taste the difference as well ,real oil makes a difference , not as good as it is
these cookies are amazing they taste as good as if not better than the original brands i only wish local stores would catch on and carry this cookie ,no more guilt the babies , great snack
luck everyone who has come to my house has asked to try one and they went crazy for them if you are craving something sweet after a meal and still want to put good things into your body you will absolutely love these cookies delicious to munch and no weird after taste whatsoever unlike the whonu chocolate chip cookies just sweet chocolatey oreo esque br br i will say though that i cannot for the life of me figure out why they are so expensive on amazon maybe because they are not in every grocery store yet so when combined with shipping amazon can get away with charging a little more who knows i know i bought them here for convenience and i am so glad i got three boxes i know you can find them in or walmart for around br br wherever you end up getting them enjoy ,delicious , good but not great
healthier for you true they have almost the same sugar fat and carb amounts of the best known name brand of these cookies but as others have noted they also give you fiber with noticeably more vitamins and minerals than that other brand this is a plus br br they re really good as a snack and it is hard to stop at the serving size of just three cookies but i guess i am allowed an occasional guilty pleasure as i write this they are a bit too expensive on this website try looking for these cookies elsewhere unless you want the convenience of having them shipped to your door br br overall these awesome chocolate sandwich creme cookies by whonu are the best i definitely recommend them as an excellent healthier alternative to the major name brand of this type of cookie br br i love em enjoy ,chocolate creme cookies delicious and healthier than the name brand , delicious and healthy snack
i bought these locally not from amazon i am in arizona and they are sold in and stores they are absolutely delicious and taste just like other cookies i bought all four of the flavors to test them out the only one i did not like was the chewy chocolate chip all others though are wonderful i count calories and try to eat healthy but i do indulge with treats sometimes this is the perfect treat since it has all the vitamins and fiber i will never eat a regular cookie again what is the point when you can actually get nutrition from tasty cookies ,so delicious , good but not great
i love these cookies they taste exactly like oreos but unfortunately every time i eat them cookies at a time i get horrible headaches and which i do not get from real oreos its obviously caused by some of the nutritious ingredients another thumbs down they include vitamin k which should not be eaten by anyone on blood or for anyone middle aged or older who in these cookies be warned vitamin k can cause blood br headache migraine beware of these cookies ,delicious but , great snack
as well but i am guessing it is less because they do not bother me i like them much better it is weird because i like chocolate sandwich cookies better than vanilla ones in general but with whonu the vanilla wins for me br br yesterday i had a craving for a chocolate sandwich cookie and i bought oreos even oreos do not taste as good as they used to i guess since the trans fat change in products the whonu cookies have the extra vitamins and nutrients and less sodium but the oreos have a better flavor the difference in fat content does not seem to be very different actually the difference in sodium does not seem very significant either i decided i would rather eat a few oreos than a few of these it is something you have to decide for yourself when comparing the pros and cons ,okay , not bad but not as good as it is
plus i had a coupon i purchased the crispy cookies the vanilla sandwich cookies and the chocolate sandwich cookies i thought they were all very good and would not hesitate to buy them again i found these cookies to taste very good very similar to an oreo except that the cookie part was a little thinner and crispier than an oreo oreos might taste a bit better but then they are oreos come on a cool fact i found out when i was looking up ingredients for whonu chocolate sandwich cookies and oreos the first ingredient in regular oreos is sugar and in these cookies and most other sandwich cookies i think it is flour i found that interesting for some reason anyway out of the three flavors i tried this was my least favorite but only because i like vanilla alot these are still great tasting chocolate sandwich cookies ,really good cookies , good but not as good as you are
these are overpriced it is a package of three boxes but when you take into account that they are a dollar of two per box than they should be you then have to pay for shipping sorry i would skip them my local grocery store carries them and a box is anywhere from to each although these are healthier than some other cookies you still have to watch the fat sugar and salt contents whole foods are much better for you but in a moment or two of these fit the bill just the price on this site is ridiculous ask your grocer to start carrying them ,these are good but , good but not great
we purchased this product and were greatly disappointed the product did not have the texture or the taste that it should have we contacted customer service and when they discovered that we were complaining they suddenly could not understand us and said customer service would contact us we never got a call back and could not get in touch with them again very expensive and no quality stay away from this company we lived in for years and know what this product should taste like and this was not what it should have tasted like ,away from this company , not as good as it is
i purchased cafe crazy caramel flavored whole bean br coffee it has a very good flavor and would buy again and the price was great ,nice caramel flavor , good coffee
great fresh coffee beans gave as a christmas gift we all had some of it and loved it the smell was great and the flavour was ,cafe crazy whole beans pound , great coffee
this gum is my absolute favorite by purchasing on amazon i can get the savings of large at a very good price i highly recommend to all gum plus as you enjoy the peppermint flavor and of breath you are your teeth all at the same time ,white is the best , great taste
i found wrigley orbit white peppermint the search ended i have been chewing this gum for many years now i occasionally try something else but nothing ever wins the peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath and toward the end of its chewable life it does not start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do it simply loses its flavor br br only drawbacks i usually chew pieces at a time so they are a bit small and they just changed the packaging it used to fit nicely in your back pocket inside suit pocket etc now its twice as thick and poorly out so it is not sure why they had to change probably to do with retail stores this will not prevent me from buying it but it is really annoying wrigley just never change the flavor ,the best bad and no after taste , it is
i bought these for my girlfriend who just happens to live in california and she loved them the chocolates came fresh and the packaging was just beautiful br br hand written card her name was hand written on the front of the card and extra care was taken in the whole process i will definitely buy again from br br if i could rate higher i would i was sent a refund for the shipping because my girlfriend lived nearby i have never had such an honest company before that was pretty cool ,great chocolates , great product
got these luscious wine chocolates to use as part of my stocking stuffers they were yummy and a big hit with everyone would definitely buy again ,excellent chocolates , great taste
i was starting to think that and i just did not share the same idea about what is good in snack flavors i have tried several of their other pretzel pieces flavors buffalo wing and honey mustard and was very disappointed i have to say that these cheddar cheese flavor pieces are not just good but good they have a very rich buttery cheese flavor with pleasant aftertaste these are totally addictive it is very easy to munch through the entire large bag in one setting ,best flavor , not as good as i like
very tasty cheese flavor because of crunch and small pieces of mixed size it goes a long way without adding too many calories a good buy b apple valley ,one of the best snacks going , delicious
my husband is a pretzel lover and has become addicted to these i do not see the draw being firmly in the potato chip camp myself but to each his own our local stores only stock these occasionally so he has tried all the other flavors and while he does like the jalapeno they do not like him back it is nice to be able to buy them here and not have to run all over town looking for them ,thanks for these , good for you
my daughter loves these snacks and cannot get them in china where she is working now so i ordered them for her very satisfied and she was very ,great , great snack
when we get very busy in our home i like this sausage a lot for quick meal options the flavor is a bit sweet and works well with lots of types of vegetables usually i will slice it and saute it until done then add sweet potatoes potatoes and onions to the pan to make up a skillet with a bit of cheese on top it is all the food in a one pan meal that my family enjoys mac and cheese with peas and sausage mixed in is another option that my daughter is crazy for for that i cut the sausage into coins and cook it up then make up the homemade mac and cheese as usual add frozen peas and the sausage and finish cooking the sweetness of the sausage with the salty of the cheese is good and it is just so easy to make ,a favorite quick meal solution , great product
i use these to keep my finicky toddler protein levels up what is great is that they are delicious just about any way you can imagine cooking a sausage br br a favorite recipe one large onion about a tablespoon each dried basil and oregano and some salt and pepper in about t of butter add sausage that is been cut into coins and russet potatoes cut into thick rounds cover all with chicken stock and simmer until potatoes are soft but not dissolved throw in a few handfuls of pre washed baby spinach i usually use about a half a pound and frozen would work fine just put it in a minute earlier stir until the spinach is cooked and then serve enjoy ,a in my house , great product
having recently purchased a single cup coffee maker we discovered green mountain and their delicious varieties of coffee i love the island coconut flavor so much it is now a staple in our household with all other flavors taking a nd seat the roast of the coffee is wonderful and really lets the coconut shine through try it with a little chocolate coffee mate creamer and you will swear you were having a decadent treat straight from the islands yum ,best coffee ever , great coffee
the best smooth tasting new coffee we have had since we have been to the islands all good as ice coffee ,coffee , great coffee
if you are looking for a very light refreshing coffee this one is for you nice coconut flavor without any bitterness may be too light for some people ,great mild coffee , great coffee
me or maybe it was that these are more corn than oat so the flavor was different from that as well oats are the third ingredient after corn and sugar i thought cheerios were always oat cereals all things considered especially price i will stick with honey nut br br they tasted pretty good just plain from the box so i think i will save them for when i want a slightly sweet snack but not too sugary i will pour out a handful and eat them like a toddler br br i expected these to be more sugary than the honey nut but these have grams of sugar per serving compared to grams for the honey nut but they have the same total carbohydrates grams per serving so there is not much difference in how it affects your body br br bottom line i will not buy them again ,flavor did not work for me back to honey nut , not bad but not bad
i became addicted to eating these the first time i tasted them which was years ago once you eat one you just cannot stop until they are gone they are not too sweet and make the perfect snack i love these things ,delicious treat , delicious
my care package had some of these candies in it and wow are they good americans have little exposure to sesame seeds except a burger bun time to taste these nutty little wonders individually wrapped to keep them fresh and slow you down better than peanut brittle any day and these are kosher for ,treat , great taste
i have had many types of pepper jelly and this is by far the worst ever the price is high and the taste is not good the shipping was outrageous more costly than the green pepper jelly do not waste you money ,not good , not as good as it is
this is amongst the best i have eaten not or super chewy like a lot of the other ones just perfect individually wrapped pieces in the box ,excellent , great product
i am allergic to wheat so i have few options for pasta corn pasta has a grainy texture that i do not care for quinoa pasta is the same and rice pasta has a tendency to stick together this pasta is perfect i think i even overcooked it a bit and it still held it is shape s farm animals and it was delicious my husband also agreed that it was really good the calorie count seems a little lower than other pastas as well i will continue to order this product as long as amazon carries it it is ,my new fave pasta , great product
my celiac daughter loves the gluten free animal pasta it is by far her favorite we make macaroni and cheese with it and she asks for it several times a week and takes the leftovers to school for lunch the next day she loves that the pasta is animal shapes and different colors and the horse is her favorite a must have ,daughter favorite food , great for
i ordered this pasta because i thought my children would love the animal shapes since i am the only in our home i try to find fun things for the entire family instead of making separate meals when i served this at dinner the other night my husband said it all he followed his surprised look with now this is pasta we could not believe how good this pasta was we are now hooked i can not wait to try some more of the products ,now this is pasta , great product
i have to eat gluten free but my family doesn t this is the only pasta so far that my kids cannot see a real difference they like it a lot this is one i fix when i do not have time or energy to fix separate things for them and myself because it tastes yummy for all of us ,great product , gluten free bisquick
these brownies bake up very nicely i would call their consistency cake like however my husband called them healthy brownies he said he could taste the flax seed i tend to agree in my opinion if i am going to eat chocolate i do not want it to have that healthy taste on the other hand i love the blueberry muffins that hodgson mill makes ,my husband these healthy , good but not great
loves them i buy them in bulk and love other hodgson mill products as well br br if you eat nothing but white flour products and cannot get used to or absolutly hate whole grains and their taste and texture then this is not the product for you if you are the family that tries to make healthy choices and have healthier then this is a wonderful product i still love to have my junk food pillsbury and hershey here i come i just try to have it only on very special occasions the rest of the time i choose to my body and satisfy my taste buds that is when i reach for this brownie mix br br my only complaint is that they do not taste too great after only a couple days so make up a batch eat em up quick within days and you will be ,guilt free , not as good as i be
good but i add a cup of whole wheat flour and a tsp of baking powder along with a couple of tbsp of cocoa powder because i like brownies a little higher and more cake like they come yummy and with the added flour they are not too sweet ,mill mix , delicious
br these are in no way low calorie or low fat though instructions call for a lot of oil eggs and butter you can use earth balance and egg replacer if you are vegan flax seeds also have a good amount of fat although the healthy kind i have made them with olive oil before and they were just as good i have also added extra organic cocoa powder to make them extra chocolatey but they really do not need it i love the chewy texture of the flax seeds there are very few ingredients i could probably make the same brownies homemade but it would be a pain to have to grind the flax seeds etc these are easy and yummy even though they are not necessarily healthy from a calorie and fat i can feel good about giving my kids treats that are not loaded with processed crap ,but not guilt free , great for a good price
add walnuts to this healthful brownie and perhaps a light do not or it will be very dry lots of good stuff in this brownie but the flax taste is a little strong i really feel no guilt when having a brownie snack for me or my kids ,needs a , not as good as it is
i really like this brownie mix unfortunately my local grocer has stopped carrying them hence buying them from amazon they are easy to prepare and bake up very nicely very moist and i think it has just the right amount of chocolate flavor yes they are healthy and are more dense than traditional brownies but they fill my chocolate craving better and i really feel like i have eaten dessert not just some from a box ,love em , great taste
i made these according to package directions and added cup of mini chocolate chips and they were awesome they took longer to cook than the box says maybe that is because of the chocolate chips either way they were great and i will definitely make them again ,yummy , great chips
for quite a while before amazon starting food items it was nearly impossible to locate this healthy favorite brownie mix there were and food sites how hard it was to locate so when we saw it on amazon we ordered a case and baked up batches for all our friends and family the was it tastes healthier but never the less quite good it is far better when prepared with at least a cup of mini chocolate chips not regular chips which can sink to the bottom we buy good quality belgian chocolate this mix is a great alternative if you want less guilt in your guilty pleasures ,yet tasty if you add mini chips , great chips
of course they do not taste quite as good as regular brownies but that is because they are healthy and that being said they are fantastic why eat crap when there are such good alternatives ,these are , not as good as
if your not into healthy and into flax seed do not buy these they are healthy and they taste like it i love them they are very good my husband loved them too it is all a matter of taste if you are looking for a hines brownie these are not it ,good if you like , good for you
mill my own grains wheat rye barley and i even put flax seed in my home made yogurt i have been a baker for years and love to try new recipes br br i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results the box calls for too much fat and the baked brownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth i can enjoy the and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the box br br one of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed well br br i will go back to making whole wheat brownies from scratch a little bit of time required a little less convenient but brownies being a treat and comfort food the texture should be right ,product , a great product
we like this brownie mix and i usually use the low fat recipe on it i also add chocolate chips or something else to it otherwise it ends up a little bit dry br br we still buy this by the case ,a feel better some health , great taste
these brownies are good but the flax seed texture can be a real turn off to it i added a little whole wheat flour splenda and cocoa big improvement and my guests never complained like they did the first time i made the brownies ,good healthy dessert but needs work , not as good as it is
you can taste the flaxseed in these whole wheat muffins and it is a great taste good chocolate flavor and texture i add chopped walnuts ,best , great taste
if you are used to eating flaxseed then this is the brownie for you hodgson mill brownies are super easy to make and taste great since i like dark chocolate i usually add a little more cocoa ,delicious , great taste
i was hoping for a health substitute for white flour brownies it is ok but not what i would serve to company i substitute canola oil for the butter or and that may have been the problem of course i up eating them all anyway ,not , not as good as it is
first off i love whole wheat products and flax seed so i hope we just got a bad batch and no it was not expired i checked the date but my mom and i just had some of these and we are not fans they had an oddly fishy grassy taste to it kind of like you might get with rancid flax oil tablets o o ,surprised by all the good reviews , delicious
i received all the ingredients in a timely manner all the ingredients were nicely packed and remained fresh through the shipping stages it was more than i needed for the meal i was making so i had plenty of left over ingredients ,and fresh , great product
the produce was extremely fresh i made a delicious thai soup with the items and had plenty to spare ,excellent , not as good as
i first tried this tea at at french restaurant that had ran out of the usual black tea with mint to my surprise this tea beats any tea without milk no sugar needed it is naturally sweetened ,excellent tea , great tea
love this hot chocolate nice creamy flavor the price is good and i love the single packs this is not a flavor available to me locally ,yummy , great hot chocolate
i love the chamomile tea its sweet and mild its excellent for a bed time tea ,wonderful loose leaf tea , great tea
with all herbal it is important to understand that the earlier in one will start using them the better br i love to use herbal teas and find them very effective when used properly ,goodness , great product
i do not know which herb is so tasty in here but it is a great combination i do not like licorice flavors and this tea is great because i can the great benefits of licorice root without tasting it br br it really does help my symptoms and drinking it for has worked great for me as well and you cannot beat the shipping price free with super saver shipping with amazon ,delicious , delicious
i always start my son on this tea when he starts a cold he actually now asks for it i prepare it and put it in a for him to drink during the day at school it works wonders when he starts drinking it right away when the symptoms are obvious the throat does from this tea if he starts it after the illness has taken full course it still helps it sooth it a lot my son loves it and i have recommended to other friends who now buy it all the time great effective results ,effective and tea for kids , great tea
we just got our first order a few days ago and my month old daughter loves them they are just like the gerber mini veggies but much cheaper although they still cost a good bit having a nutrient filled easy to take anywhere travel snack is well worth it my daughter does not have any teeth yet and she has not had any problems eating them they are light and fluffy yet full of flavor ,wonderful healthy snack for baby , great for
i do not know why my toddler is so crazy about these but he is he was snacking on so many cheerios every day that i was desperate to find something else that he would like but would not require refrigeration and this saved the day i feel good about feeding him healthier snacks and he is positively in love with these ,for , great for
my dog has heart failure and cannot have the standard dog treats because of the salt these are perfect she likes to hunt for her snacks and these are perfect to toss out to her and let her go nuts she really likes them ,got them for my dog with , my dog loves these
i have been buying these for nearly years and this is the time that my son has refused to eat them they are darker green than usual which was not a problem but the texture was and the flavor was not as good this is a problem since it is the only vegetable my son eats and he has severe feeding issues the taste texture were so different he was not pleased with the change ,flavor texture not good in this batch , good but not great
these are a delicious guilt free snack that i always have handy they are so convenient and last a long time i also get the corn and mixed veggies which are also wonderful you can get them at whole foods but not at this price ,love , great snack
we first tried this because our toddler went through a picky eater she loved these they are crunchy and small enough for her to pick up i love them because they are organic and a veggie that she actually asks for i mainly give them to her right out the package but i have also mixed them into scrambled eggs which she really likes too ,great for little ones , great for
these taste great and have a great texture br br our year old has little interest in eating fresh vegetables but she loves these she actually prefers these over crackers or other products of dubious nutritional value to me that fact is worth the expense it is worth the cost to get her to eat vegetables ,a great way to get kids to eat , great for
we love this brand of freeze dried fruit and veggies they make it easy to have healthy on the go snacks for our year old ,great toddler snacks , great snack
my month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food they are tasty healthy and have zero additives on the downside every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a rock i can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth so i worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth that being said it is been months and nothing bad has happened and it has not worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas it is just something that i feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product ,great toddler snack quality , great for
feel like a protein boost got the nibbles do not want to to potato chips here is a great alternative just do not let your toddler try to open the package or your peas will be all over the floor making for an expensive snack for the dog and a mommy ,amazing snack my kids love them too , great product
i like the dried peas from just tomatoes and i also like their just corn they are way too expensive though they are really handy because i do not use frozen or canned foods because i follow an diet which them when i can not find fresh peas i have to use these i will probably have to do without as i cannot afford these too bad ,very good but too expensive , not as good as it is
even though this item is listed under the gluten free category it is not the ingredients state that it contains wheat protein do not order this if you need gf food bad reviewing by amazon ,not gluten free , not as good as it is
i bought this for christmas and gave a few away as gifts you get a bunch of boxes but if you love bacon there are a lot of uses for it i have made sour cream chip dip cheese balls added to mashed potatoes and mac cheese sprinkled on baked potatoes in place of bacon bits if you can dream it you can do it br br the bacon flavor is not over powering it is a subtle delicious taste i love davis davis products and will be trying different varieties for sure ,you get a lot but has a lot of , not as good as it is
dogs love this product but it ends up too crumbly and hard to give to the dogs but it is really a great product ,dog treats , my dog loves them
for serious goat cheese lovers this is a step up from the french goat cheese that you can buy at the grocery store i had never had smoked goat cheese before and this was a the creamy smooth a little sour taste went well with the smoke flavor i used it sprinkled over a tomato bean and salad and also spread on toast points topped with an apple zucchini relish from the outstanding artisan cheese that i look forward to enjoying again ,delish cheese i will buy over and over again , great product
if you like goat cheese and smoked cheeses you will love this it has a very smokey creamy flavor try it spread on crackers with a little black truffle oil ,fantastic goat cheese , delicious
i have a history of mild moderate acid reflux so i take it easy with coffee i was delighted to discover puroast which is a reduced acid coffee that is reasonably priced the french roast flavor is utterly delicious it tastes like i went to a coffee house for fancy coffee but it is just brewed in my drip coffee pot in my kitchen even more convenient if my husband does it for me try it you will not be disappointed the cinnamon flavor is also very very good ,very delicious coffee , great coffee
i have not been able to drink coffee for over years due to and indigestion with even a few drops of the stuff coffee is my favorite and reaching i gave puroast a try this stuff is a miracle not only am i free it is good coffee i am so thankful to be able to have coffee back in my life ,i love this coffee , not as good as it is
i was delighted to discover this rich tasting coffee which has half the acid of regular brands i served it to a guest with an acid reflux problem and she not only enjoyed the cuppa she reported that she felt fine afterwards this is a great coffee to have in your pantry for y guests or to stock for discerning coffee drinkers who find the taste of starbucks and dunkin donuts simply too harsh also loved the charming packaging ,better than , great coffee
this coffee is a great alternative for someone who has acid reflux and problems the low acid allows me to still have my caffine for the day maybe not as smooth tasting as my usual blend but i am so thankful for it really close in taste ,great alternative for coffee , good coffee
i have been using this low acid coffee for a few weeks now and along with the taste i enjoy not having an acid stomach especially the morning after to me there is no difference in taste between it and regular coffee br br i give it stars ,delicious , delicious
i decided to try puroast over a year ago because of stomach problems and mouth puroast did the trick plus it tastes great could not be happier with it although i wish they would bring the organic decaf back ,i only drink coffee , great product
my wife and i tried this product a few days ago we were not disappointed the coffee had a good flavor and the low acid was a nice added benefit ,nice alternative to regular coffee , great taste
i struggle between giving this or even stars because i am just thankful for the substitute as i have a condition that i need low acid coffee for however i do have to admit it tastes like burnt coffee as someone else put it and it is no peets or starbucks the taste and the flavor it leaves in your mouth after you are done is something i do not think i will ever get used to br br update i had my father in law up would like to say that if you are one like he is that puts of creamer and sugar in your coffee apparently you will not notice a difference in taste from this brand to another hope that helps ,wonderful substitute , not as good as i have
if you do not want to give up the taste of coffee but cannot handle the acid try this coffee does not taste like gourmet coffee but it does not produce acid side effects ,low acid makes a difference , not as good as it is
i love love love dark roasted coffee and do not like a acid taste so i thought this would be great br br i was pleased with the no acid taste but i had to use twice as much to get the same flavor i usually like that would not be a big deal but it meant i went through the coffee faster than i should have and that can get expensive br br this blend was ground very finely so would not be good with a french press i was able to use it with a pour over ,low acid taste tastes more like a medium roast , great coffee
cup of peet coffee as much as the next guy i am a okay with a batch of folger or the basic house brand of whatever chain store i happen to be shopping in i am usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that is not highway robbery br br alas for all of its low acidity and decent price this coffee is not that pleasant kick start there is an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe other than to say that puroast does not really taste like french roast coffee even up with cinnamon and milk the unpleasant flavor remains br br so yes this coffee is effective if you absolutely need to have coffee but if you are looking for a pleasant low acid kick start to your day black tea might be a better tastier option ,a good bad for low acid , the best coffee ever
i did not have high expectations that i would like this but i love coffee and have trouble with nausea from the acid i am a starbucks fan and while this was not as full bodied as that it was surprisingly good nice to not have the acid issues that come with coffee this did not bother me at all or make me i still prefer the taste of starbucks but now i am not sure the extra body is worth the acid this is a good alternative that i found i liked better and better as i got use to it give it a try ,surprisingly good and no , not as good as i have
this is a great company and the first i have ever seen to offer a low acid option you can absolutely taste the difference it is coffee without the bitterness makes it possible to enjoy the of the bean without the bitter taste they also have very cool black love them ,best coffee ever , great taste
i drink cups a day of verona italian or french roast coffee and wanted to try a lower acid version this brand of coffee smells and tastes like vinegar it is totally unpalatable and you are better off drinking water if the acid in coffee you ,single worst coffee ever , not as good as it is
this coffee tastes so nasty i cannot even drink it it is disgusting i cannot believe anything this bitter is acid free i actually threw away two bags ,the worst tasting coffee i have ever tasted , not as good as it is
i use this in my breadmaker but make it with warm milk and an additional egg which greatly improves the texture when made with just water and a small amount of butter the crust comes out very very chewy in my i have also made this bread and used carrot juice in place of the water which makes it a beautiful color and naturally sweet ,can be easily , not as good as it is
i have tried many bread machine mixes and most have been okay but this one rates an excellent because not only is it a very good basic loaf it also works very well with additives either prepared entirely in the bread machine or after the second rise removed from the machine shaped and baked on a stone in the oven br and flattened with a filling of either savory or sweet ingredients then rolled and set to rise and then bake in a loaf pan it produced excellent herb and onion bread cinnamon raisin bread and a brown butter and seed bread br i buy it via the subscribe and save plan as i use it often ,an excellent bread machine mix , great product
i must admit when i first ordered this bread for my new bread maker i was not expecting anything other than potato bread such as i buy at a nearby store however was i ever surprised it was absolutely the best stuff and with some organic butter high and properly melted it was on a par with i just could not believe how good it was and is since the first loaf i have made other breads which have been generally excellent but none are quite at the level of this potato bread it is really good perhaps the credit goes to my new bread machine highly recommended general info the package makes a pound loaf on my machine the recommended setting is basic and the loaf bakes in hours also the flour is non gmo verified as labelled ,great super wonderful delicious bread , great product
since i started making hodgson wholesome potato bread my husband will not eat store bought bread anymore we make about two loaves a week in different varieties of the hodgson mill brand the honey whole wheat and white bread mixes are also great br i like using my old bread machine to make the dough then shape into loaf and bake in the oven makes perfect loaf every time also makes delicious rolls br glad i discovered this brand of bread mixes on amazon they are wholesome and i know what i am putting into the bread i bake now great product ,good back to the bread , best ever
i used extra yeast and a little more water and it came out very light with a heard crust which i like i will order it again not much of a potato taste but good bread ,potato bread , not as good as it is
i recently purchased a bread machine and i tried this potato bread mix i have made it three times now and it has come out amazing each and every time the other great thing about this particular mix is that i have experimented with the amount of butter in the last batch i actually doubled the butter amount but then added less water and it came out buttery and br br i encourage everyone who has a bread machine to try this particular mix ,awsome bread , great product
i had a slicing failure where you cannot get a slice to hold together long enough to lay it down the different types themselves well to adding ingredients such as chopped nuts or sesame seeds or seed or use your own imagination coming in nice units of loaves makes pantry storage easy and once opened the carton yields boxes with best by dates easily accessible on each so your shelf stock is almost br br next time you walk a grocery store note the prices there here again i think you really cannot beat the quality with a really fair price that hodgson provides it seems to me that they have great effort to have the best product they can produce the best shipping available for their customers br br buy with great confidence based on my experiences with them during the last years i hope this helps decision making ,potato bread , a great product for your

i love this bread i do not even like the smell of commercial bread you can smell the chemicals from miles i added rosemary garlic and olive oil to the mix and serve it just out of the machine it was a hit with my dinner guests ,great bread , great product
this was great so soft so tasty better than expected perfect loaf every time ,how good , great taste
i was a little disappointed i first made the muffins with it and then let the bread machine make and bake a loaf ok next i will try mixing it myself and baking in my oven i do have to keep in mind though that potato bread is dense and heavier than say white bread convenient is a plus ,potato bread mix , great product
i have tried a few of this brand of bread mix in my bread machine and while all have been good i must say to my family and i that this is the best i have made potato bread from scratch in my bread machine and this is right up there with that nice flavor great texture well worth the price i have bought this a few times on amazon and will continue to do so ,my fave mill bread mix , best ever
i am extremely satisfied with both hodgson mill bread mixes that i purchased online the potato bread mix actually rose and stuck to the top of my bread making machine and became in the mixing blade so it was difficult to remove otherwise the bread tasted great the rye bread was also delicious it didn rise as much and i had no trouble removing it from the bread machine the rye loaf was much than the potato bread loaf br br the only drawback to purchasing these products online was the shipping costs i have since found out that i can purchase the same brand products at heb and kroger grocery stores and will not order online again ,mill bread mix products , great product
i just got my bread machine for christmas so being a i thought i would try to keep it simple the hodgson mill products are wonderful everything is included even the yeast the bread came out delicious it was easy to slice it is like eating a country white bread not soft n mushy like traditional white bread my family enjoyed this it makes great toast as well if you try this i think you will be happy with it ,what a great product , great product
this is a fantastic bread mix i do not use the bread machine i make it in a bowl hand made and have had no problems at all i do not know why people are having any problems with this it is terrific amazon please keep this in stock please ,excellent bread mix , great product
i like this bread and several other flavors in this brand this one and the seven grain are my favorites they bake consistently well in my wolfgang puck machine recommended ,nice bread , great product
this product is as good as any that i have ever used and is so convenient through amazon as it has become hard to find in the stores ,good to use the bread machine again , great taste
i love these bread mixes there is nothing like making your own bread i admit i use a bread maker not clever enough to use my hands but i still enjoy the experience i have tried different hodgson mixes and they are both excellent ,excellent bread mix , great product
the potato bread was easy to mix well in my breadmaker cooks as it should and best of all was very tasty the bread has a near white bread texture and was very good i purchased all of the hodgson mixes and this was one of my favorites ,great easy homemade bread , great product
i recently tried this line of breads on vacation and loved the one we tried i could not find the european cheese herb flavor that we had locally so i went to order from amazon com as happens from time to time the seller was out of that flavor so i picked up the potato bread instead and it was also very good i still need to get the cheese herb because that one was awesome ,great bread , great product
this is delicious bread and i can quickly make up loaves of bread to eat or give away for a special gift ,delicious homemade bread , delicious
my family and i all agree that hodgson mill potato bread is one of the best mixes on the market a loaf of this bread lasts about two hours before it is gone it has become a favorite of ours and we will be making lots do not run out of this one ,potato bread winner , great product
i have made potato bread before with great results but this hodgson bread mix is way too dry it needs some more moisture don t buy it unless you want really dry bread ,potato bread , great product
y all br br this bread is pretty good the potato flavor is there as potato bread if you have had it before and not overwhelming makes a good sandwich bread with meats or an different base br br made it with vegetable oil and olive oil as usual the good olive oil makes for a somewhat better flavor br br rated a three cuz it is just exactly as expected average with no br br take care br lee ,good tasty and easy bread , great product
white bread is not my thing so that is probably why i do not like this one i like white breads and really full bodied white breads but otherwise i always choose whole grains this one is not full bodied and has no particular flavor not interesting at all to me ,if you like white bread , best popcorn ever
i am a bit disappointed the flavor was not what i wanted or expected ,bread , not as good as
as a former chef owner of a restaurant in my younger years i was surprised and delighted at the exceptionally good taste and texture of the white clam sauce doctoring it is a great product for easy convenience ,absolutely delicious , best popcorn ever
to the gentleman who reviewed this and said just go to the store and get better well i am disabled and the van only allows us two packages to carry can you see me carrying two big cases of water home i think not br br this is wonderful water sure you could get it on sale at a better price and if you can drive or have someone to drive you and carry it in please do so but for me it is a sweet deal i ordered six cases and watched the ups guy set them inside the door for me i have nothing to complain about if the price is right for you with all considered you will not go wrong here ,water i did not have to in , best popcorn ever
this water is delicious i am not picky but i can taste bad water with chemicals or metal taste and this has none of that and at cents per bottle delivered to your door it is a great price i have a teenage son and he drinks these all the time and it is a okay with me better than drinking a coke ,great water , best water ever
quite heavy and can be a real pain in your backpack br bottom line for me the taste and convenience are worth the price and i will continue to buy it as long as my budget allows updated note i have been drinking this water for four months now and had an interesting experience that bears sharing my local kroger had spring water on sale so i picked up a case wow was that ever a mistake even though the bottles are very light weight the taste of the water is so different from spring water in that there is a distinct flavor i have enjoyed the in the past but had no idea i was settling for drinking plastic water my goodness how my taste buds and senses have changed since drinking the pure goodness on spring water i am totally convinced it is worth the extra cost now ,good water only with a price , good but not a of of
i am a so i know about water and why it can taste like heaven e g it is tasteless and why it can taste like sweat e g mineral enhanced this water is expensive cheap for online but costly if you are a walmart or target however i highly recommend you try this if you want tasteless water you see when water is mineral enhanced and its around through the various and the road provides in the summer heat the water tends to build a certain taste which some like and others don t i like my water tasteless therefore i recommend this product to those whom do not want h o minerals but just plain water ,best water ever , not as good as it is
this was my first purchase of this water it tastes great and the bottles are thicker than most also everyone likes that name haha ,great tasting water , great product
water tastes good i typically prefer only water did a study on this in grad school back in the day but for use at the office this fills the bill i think it tastes good and looks br br bottles are of course recyclable so i do not feel guilty saying i like the quality of the bottle as well i once had someone water and they got a chain grocer brand at a steal but the bottle was so flimsy i do not like that one bit this is the best of both worlds br br shipment arrived fully intact for me ,happy with the purchase , not as good as it is
the bottles themselves have not spilled a drop of the water br we are on our third case of it right now and very happy with this purchase the water tastes good and the bottles hold their shape br br about weight of these bottles commented upon in another review i thought the comment was interesting and it reminded me that yes i do drive a few bottles to work in the car i do not backpack them not a really obvious difference in weight though i think maybe necessary for shipping br br guess it is like choosing sleeping bags if you are using a vehicle you can use a heavier sleeping bag so they tell me br anyway i think you will like this water and you get bottles per case instead of the usual br we plan to order more we are glad we can do this ,instead of the , great product
three of us tried it one of us was barely able to drink it with ice i guess this is like an acquired taste unless you are able to try a single bottle before purchase i recommend you pass ,awful , not as good as it is
this water is really good it is reasonably priced it is mountain spring water please order at least once you will not regret it it is priced right you get qt ounce bottles for a great price use your standard shipping to days i think free shipping that way you can buy more product be aware that this is very popular product and sometimes amazon is out of stock so you may have to wait or weeks but it is worth the wait it is a great product ,water , not as good as it is
i i was satisfied with the spring water i have bought elsewhere until i bought this brand best i have ever tasted no chemical aftertaste i have cases a month delivered since i also use it for all cooking needs and ice cubes too it is soooooo delicious when making a glass of lemonade from fresh lemons with the cubes with agave sweetener as others have stated the ups man does all the hard work and i do not have to worry about running out of the most important staple in my household ,excellent quality , best ever
i bought this water for my pet and they love this water i have never seen them drink so much in their lives i bought this water because cannot drink tap water and spring water is the best for them br i am mad though because i purchased this item week ago and now it is cheaper br overall i love this item great water br i tasted it for myself and it does taste great ,water for my , best stuff ever
love this water feels silky smooth and clean when you drink it really love the bottles nice and sturdy no squishy plastic and since i had hard time buying and carrying from the grocery store love the automatic delivery to my back door a little more money than store brands but well worth it ,highly recommend , great product
i have a recurring shipment of this product each month every month when the boxes arrive they are barely in one piece and very last month one of the cases of water had to be before it arrived and it was a day late br br i suggest using a more sturdy box for shipping br br the water product is fine it is just the shipping packaging i have a problem with ,shipping packaging is poor , not as good as it is
i enjoyed this water it was very refreshing i find i have some stomach sensitivity with some bottled waters i did not have that problem with this water nice bottles water comes from washington ,water , the best
time i got it it was the most economical water that shipped free with prime so if they keep that up it will be a great deal for a lot of people br br i might be because i was just up in washington where this water is from and almost all of the bottled water i got up there plus the tap water was better than this but i love washington water so i am probably judging it too br br it not bad and it does have a unique water taste so i am sure this will be someone absolute favorite water no one will hate this water br br pros br this is good water br has a unique taste br everyone will like it but not a lot of people will ask for more br br cons br i expect more from washington water than this ,most water is better than this , this is the best
i bought this water when i was at college for the first week i felt bad using my roommate water all the time and i was states away from home so i ordered this water it was delicious but the only complaint i have is that the bottles were really well plastic y i felt really un green drinking water out of these huge plastic bottles br br so now i just ask my roommate to buy water for me when she goes home on the i give her she runs to walmart and gets me cases of water bottles yay me br br sometimes i still think about this water longing for it as i sip my coffee or tea or ramen juice and say to myself this would be so much better with talking rain br br its one college student battle between deliciousness and eco ,it is , not as good as it is
somehow my previous review got i live in houston tx i buy lots of bottled water cannot tell any difference between a bottle of talking rain and a glass of cold tap water ,just water nothing more , not as good as it is
though this coffee was expensive compared to regular store bought i am a huge fan coffee usually tears up my stomach so i have been a tea drinker for years but this coffee has a low acidic level so i can handle it the aroma is and the bag lasted a long time i am a fan of beans versus grounds so that was another plus it was prompt and the packaging my coffee stayed fresh and intact ,a great buy , good but not great
do not buy this if your thinking its only mango ingredient says fruit juice blend organic white grape juice organic apple juice and organic pineapple juice from concentrate organic mango puree br br i cancelled order as soon as i realized this drink had grape and pineapple ,its not only but pineapple , not as good as it is
i bought this juice because i really like mangoes it is great refreshing and smooth beverage that everybody in our family enjoy will buy again ,nice sweet , great taste
these are great spices to use on all food types giving a great flavor the bottle sizes are twice the size of that found in a supermarket and about the same price so you get more of what you would normally pay for ,amount smaller price than , great for
these are without question the best diet crackers i have ever had i have had them with and without salt and since i usually put peanut butter on them i did not need the salt br br these are great for travel for kids and when you just need a very low calorie cracker ,thin , great taste
i am not sure why the stores in my area stopped carrying these as they were usually sold out the cakes are calories crunchy and good not like the cardboard taste of thicker rice cakes excellent as a base for pb j or to make an open face sandwich or to use in pieces like a chip for dips etc good price on the pack with a month expiration use date ,excellent and healthy , good for you
these stay together better than round ones which crumble terribly they are good alone or with my favorite raw sesame butter they are very well packaged which keeps them from getting broken also each package i have opened has been fresh thanks for a great product amazon ,great little rice , great taste
i love this product so much better than the regular thick rice cakes they are thin but very compact so i use them as a great sandwich bread alternative they do not break apart quick as easily as the regular rice cakes i have searched the grocery and health food stores in my area and cannot find this product anywhere i love that they are now available for subscription through amazon com ,great for , great for
these brown rice cakes are by far the best i have tried many i can not have very many foods these are my only snack food that i can have they are so good i dont feel like i am missing anything ,the best rice cake ever , best ever
are a very different from the american style rice cakes that most people associate with the name as other reviews suggest these are not quite so air filled or crumbly having more the density and thickness of a cracker or crisp flatbread but unlike those these are gluten free oil free unsalted and contain only one ingredient puffed brown rice they have got a nice light crunch that makes them good for snacking but they are a lot healthier than chips or crackers and the brown rice is definitely preferable to a more processed white rice cake if you are mindful of blood sugar impact they are also great for the occasional mild tummy upset since they are light and bland and do not require the preparation of other bland foods br br try them with hummus my personal favorite peanut butter jam and a sprinkling of chia seeds yum ,me to how much i love these , delicious and healthy
i make a special butter spread that i like on them real well you take equal parts of room temperature butter olive oil and water and blend ingredients until smooth you can refrigerate this it sets up but does not get hard so it is always and tastes really good i use organic butter olive oil and filtered water but you do not have this spread is so good and i believe it is better for you than straight butter br br also i only use one cake to make a single sided sandwich as with any rice cake using two as you would two pieces of bread just does not seem to work as well but a single sided with these rice cakes is very enjoyable br br hope this helps you decide to try them everyone i have given some to have had only good comments about them ,best gluten free substitute for bread and worth every , best i have ever had
surprisingly tasty thin and very cracker like and good for snacking i got these for my husband who is on a very low sodium diet these are great for when we travel it is not easy finding prepackaged low sodium foods that taste good but these work quite well ,surprisingly tasty , delicious
crisp crunchy and thin very low in sodium i usually prefer mine plain but shared a package with a friend who enjoyed these with a tuna salad topping a great alternative to the expensive styrofoam varieties sold at most stores excellent product the rice cakes for this brand are also wonderful and for those on a no salt diet sodium ,great light cracker substitute , delicious
these crackers are great the beauty is not in their own flavor but the fact that they are a perfect crispy low calorie gluten free delivery mechanism for all manner of spreads and slices they do not come with over powering artificial flavorings to compete with a topping of your choice some of my favorites are peanut butter and banana or laughing cow cheese with turkey pepperoni ,the perfect delivery , good for you
i live on salt and as a result have these products work surprisingly fast to lower your high blood pressure and to put it as nice as possible keep you alive longer and that is a scientific fact as salt is only a habit and has no real useful except to cause many unhealthy habits and conditions keep caring about us and do not stop producing foods that are very healthy ,better than expected , great taste
consumer reports rated these crackers the highest in arsenic of all the rice crackers on the market i like these crackers but will no longer eat them until the arsenic issue in brown rice is resolved ,too much , good for you
these are not only a good value health food stores really jack up the prices on rice cakes but also are nicely thin and easy to use to spread stuff on ,best value , great
i was able to do so much with these crackers they are easy to spread on and stack and put toppings on i definitely enjoyed them and so did all my friends d ,loved it it everyone loved it , great product
thin cakes are a great snack if you are trying to lose weight or just eat healthy i bought the one that is sodium cholesterol fat and sugar free for three cakes it is only calories so you can add a like or your favorite topping without the guilt they are very tasty the only problem is the availability of the product i am on a waiting list with amazon for this product ,best snack , great snack
i purchased these based on others recommendations the rice cakes are delicious thinner than the usual rice cakes in the supermarkets dense not full of air i covered them with pb those watching their weight can eat peanut butter for calories a serving vs for regular pb and it tastes exactly the same i too highly recommend these rice cakes ,delicious low calorie and healthy snack good price too , good for you
brew it correctly and you really get a beautiful cup of tea i highly recommend this brand it is by far the best bagged green tea i have found and i have tried about all of them i brew one bag in a oz mug for minutes absolutely perfect ,the best organic green tea available in , great tea
if you like green tea that brews for minutes max and you do not stew your tea by just leaving the bag in until the tea is bitter this is the tea for you of course it can be done that way but if you have refined tea taste then you will like this tea i personally love the taste of a good green tea i am so glad to find this brand available online no one sells it in my area ,tea taste , great tea
i have tried many different brands of green tea and this one is by far the best one that i have ever tried the taste is so delicious and each tea bag is tightly sealed in its own special packet which keeps it totally fresh until you use it even the are totally natural with no metal at all which can affect the taste of the tea this is my new favorite tea and i am so glad that i discovered it ,the very best organic green tea , great tea
i used to get these from sam wholesale club but with this economy i have not my membership so long story short i bought canned clams and they were horrible so then i bought baby clams and they were not as horrible but i certainly would not put them in my clam chowder so i returned all the unopened cans of and and am never ever gonna buy them again oh you go right ahead and try those other brands if you do not mind eating poop because that is about all you get clam juice and clam poop snow clams are all clams and clam juice no clam poop ,will never buy a different brand again , not as good as it is
i have been eating snow clam chowder for years so i buy a few cans when it is on sale well it looks like bee has taken over what a big mistake when i opened the can it was all watery and smelled funny i put it in a bowl to microwave and noticed how thin it was but thought i would try it anyway it was nasty to say the least it about made me sick so i went and opened another of the new cans more of the same then i got an older can of the non bee chowder and it was great like always if i could give the new junk no stars i would sucks bad ,new recipe gone bad , not as good as it is
this is the mother load of canned clams not just a can of juice with a few but cups and cups of chopped clams i found no sand and i was able to use every last drop of juices simply recipe on the can best white clam sauce i have ever made ,white clam sauce , best popcorn ever
i guess i thought of this can as being the usual commercial can so the price of about a can did not seem too bad but when they arrived i saw that these were somewhat smaller they are less than a half gallon i do not see the size as that much of a problem all i have to do is how i would use it in a recipe and free shipping helped with feeling better about the purchase but if i saw that size can in a store i would not pay for oz can br br i would have to see what fresh clams would cost first i would like if they made the clams bigger chunks but i could buy some fresh to add to it most clam chowder is made with bigger chunks than what snow makes br br good product despite the price ,size of can , not as good as it is
these are great beans for the price if you live in a big city however i would suggest buying green beans at a local shop or even a community i also remember a pea berry out of east that was outstanding but this tanzanian pea berry is comparable to standard beans ,great price , great taste
we have been using this food for about months now and find it to be just excellent other than the fact our two dogs a de lbs and standard poodle puppy lbs both love the food but are thriving their coats are in excellent condition and their overall is perfect good tasting to the dog and good for them and a good deal for the owner all around the best food we have ever used excellent ,premium quality dog food , my dog loves them
i am glad my lb cocker standard poodle puppy loves the stuff because i trust the brand and its superior nutrition compare labels my previous feed was mostly corn my little dude is healthy and happy and high energy and has a glossy coat also superior nutrition produces smaller compact stools ,good stuff , great product
i received the k cups on time and in condition i usually drink coffee but at night the hot cocoa is good with a snack just before bed ,square hot cocoa cups milk chocolate single serve cup for keurig k cup brewers , not good
this is the best hot cocoa i have had in a k cup the taste is smooth and creamy it is perfect for a cold morning or an evening hot drink i would definitely recommend this product the best part is that it can be ordered on auto delivery so i never run out ,delicious hot cocoa , great hot cocoa
i am pregnant and had to give up my hot cup of coffee i thought maybe a hot cup of this will sure does throw the kcup in and this is the best hot choc ever i choke down my vitamins with it too worth it and so cheap here ,so yummy , not as good as it is
this is quite the buy compared to other hot chocolates the kids love it quick and easy i will order this hot chocolate again ,yummy , great taste
kids loved it great product at a great price my little one can make her own hot cocoa without my ,great , great product
even on the small cup setting of the elite these are a little weak for me make sure you shake the cups before putting them in your machine or they will be way too weak i also run a cup of hot water thru the maker before using these so there is no coffe taste to them ,decent flavors but a little weak , great taste
the hot chocolate is my husband favorite service was also great as it usually is very popular now with winter coming on ,great hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
i like the rich dark smooth taste of the grove square cocoa it is the best i have found in k cups and i have been on auto delivery for at least a few months now delicious ,great cup of cocoa , good flavor
looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water no chocolate flavor whatsoever this was a complete disappointment i got the hot chocolate k cups from swiss miss instead how people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me is the amazon ratings system being for this product ,disgusting , not as good as it is
excellent coffee for people on a tight schedule my fell in love with my brother in law and had to have one now everyone that visits our house has to try a cup and keeps coming back for more also like the fact that there is a wide variety of coffee flavors to choose from ,fast very good , good coffee
the kids love the hot cocoa and i like the fact that i can get the stuff shipped to me when i need it without worry of order ,hot cocoa right on time , great hot chocolate
this was the best purchase that i could have made for my daughter it was priced beautifully and my daughter can study without worrying about the price for her college books thanks so much ,these , great coffee
as a chocoholic for many years i crave a good cup of hot chocolate this done in the keurig is really easy and fast the chocolate br is tasty and the dark chocolate tastes like the many cups of cocoa i had as a child not particularly carried away by the peppermint br flavor but it was not strong enough to matter ,a , great hot chocolate
my family loves all three flavors the dark chocolate is my favorite the price was unbeatable i will buy this product again ,great hot cocoa , great product
i found this too sweet am hoping there is an unsweetened version available not very chocolatey too kinda like swiss miss ,sweet cocoa , great taste
it has artificial sweetener which not only taste bad to me but also gives me a headache this should say light or diet to let the buyer know this i would have never bought it had i known it seems like it would taste good otherwise ,should say diet , not as good as it is
it tastes good and is little sweet so my first thought was that it had a lot of sugar i looked on the box and was surprised that it did not have that much a plus for me ,good hot cocoa , not as good as it is
the pack was a mistake all three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose that is the name of the artificial sweetner in the product if you like splenda you may like this but it has a distinct taste unfortunately not for me a few friends of mine that tried it and said it was not bad unfortunately that was the best of the comments br if you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try cafe escapes or swiss miss both are twice as good in my opinion liked the escapes best wish i liked the artificial sweetner but the that taste has a distinct after taste probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar if your going to order i would get the small pack to try it better then throwing out try cafe escapes and swiss miss and see for yourself ,if you like the taste of artificial sweetner it is ok , not bad but not as good as it is
this is the best hot cocoa product i have found for the keurig k cup brewer the others i have tried do not have the test or alot of the product remains in the cup ,grove square hot cocoa for keurig , great hot cocoa
they have some really good hot chocolate i got a single pack before and it was so good that i reordered some more i like to make a mocha by brewing one of these and then one coffee use a big cup br br one thing to note these dont have a strainer inside the entire contents are meant to be used unlike the coffee kcups so it will feel empty once done i would not recommend brewing on the smaller cup settings use a standard mug or larger because the smaller settings wont get all the chocolate from the inside to come out br br also kids may not like the peppermint flavor but that is my favorite one if you do not want to get the variety pack they sell the individual flavors too ,highly recommended hot chocolate , good but not great
i brew the oz cups and makes it too thin it is good at that point but adding some creamer whipped cream and or always improves it ,best keurig hot chocolate so far , great taste
husband and love this cocoa make it for them all the time as i drink my coffee my husband is a very picky person but for some reason he really likes this one product and wants me to keep it in stock here at the house loves it at night after dinner on cold evenings ,a service , great taste
these k cups are awesome they taste no different personally i think better than those which are priced three times as much i highly recommend this product ,great value and super yummy , great taste
i have purchased other hot cocoa cups but find grove square to be about the best of them all i usually add two teaspoons of the the flavored coffeemate creamers my favorite being the sugar free caramel by adding the sugar free creamer the taste is there but not the calories ,great taste , great taste
the most chocolatey and smooth hot cocoa ever yum it has the best price and taste for the keurig k cup brewer way better then at least other brands we ve tried different ones and this is the best and super super fast delivery thanks ,grove square , great hot cocoa
makes pretty good cocoa and a lot easier than on the stovetop not as sweet as i would prefer and needs to be stirred to keep it in i guess i can add marshmallows ,pretty good cocoa , not as good as it is
arrived quick and on time and what a great value definitely pleased with my purchase and will likely buy again ,what a great value , great
great option for excellent taste price and convenience a repeat customer on these we order these now in the pack instead of getting at the grocery store ,great product great price , great taste
grove square hot cocoa is just the right of milk chocolate not to much chocolate just the right mixture delicious i say a good cup of hot chocolate try grove square hot cocoa milk chocolate k cups for keurig coffee makers enjoy i did ,grove square hot cocoa cups milk chocolate for keurig k cups brewers , great hot cocoa
this hot coca tastes pretty good when brewed on oz setting however its not the best i have ever tasted nor the worst its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its you like it or you don t i my self happen to like it and will buy again unless i find something better ,tastes pretty good , not as good as it is
this is a great buy i love this hot chocolate because it is very low in sugar and has a good taste it is not messy like regular hot chocolate as it is all dissolved before it hits the cup would buy again ,love the hot chocolate , great taste
yum all the convenience you expect with a k cup with all the flavor of real hot chocolate the kids love it and so will you ,easy and kids love it , great hot chocolate
i really like the flavor of this hot chocolate the kids love the flavor too i always keep a box of this in the house as my kids and their friends are avid coco drinkers this makes it easier and less messy even for the younger ones no more powder spilled on the counter tops this way ,great tasting coco , great taste
this is one of my wife favorite grove square has another great product to share with kcup users now we need some to bring the price per unit down ,kcup hot cocoa , great coffee
my husband and i both love this hot chocolate we are on the auto shipment for every other month and we are going to have to change it to every month ,love it , great hot chocolate
my family really enjoys grove square hot cocoa milk chocolate and we keep a supply on hand the excellent price is what made us choose this brand but the taste is what makes us our order ,great taste for a great price , great hot chocolate
i have tried several types of hot chocolate since purchasing my keurig and this is by far the one i enjoy the most i have it shipped every month so that i do not worry about running out ,keurig hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
i liked the milk chocolate version so tried this it is just as good and with the more intense chocolate flavor to my chocolate ,great dark cocoa , great taste
when i bought my keurig brewer i eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker i am still looking the grove square hot cocoa had a nasty aftertaste almost metallic no amount of cleaning with the brewer made any improvement i used the brewer to make hot water for a nestle hot cocoa pack and that was a far superior beverage the grove square quickly found it is way to the trash i will find quality mixes and use the keurig to heat the water from now on ,still looking , not as good as it is
it is okay but it does not have a rich chocolatey taste i actually find it to have a funky taste cannot quite figure it out ,taste is okay , not as good as it is
after trying several brands of hot cocoa my kids have decided that this is the one for them i am certainly happy about it because not only is it delicious but it is also more affordable boys can consume a box of hot cocoa very quickly even with limits set it is also very convenient to have it shipped automatically if we do not drink that much i simply skip a month if friends come over and we drink a lot i just order an extra box it is quick simple and delicious ,the kids love it , great hot cocoa
to everyone worried about not getting a full cup to run through your machine with these k cups here is the trick put it in your machine close the lid open the lid turn degrees close the lid and repeat two more times you should have closed the lid on the k cup four times by now next step is to hit the brew button the problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through with the extra three holes it all out very quick and turns out good would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to could have been a little thicker overall but not bad ,found the , great coffee
the greatest best chocolate taste in any keurig k cups out there will definitely order more everyone in the office tries to steal them i am a chocolate nut and these pass the test ,the best chocolate taste out there , great taste
i have tried different brands of hot cocoa from dark to milk and the grove square milk chocolate k cups have by far been the best they are big in my family and they have given two thumbs up i would recommend anyone who enjoys hot cocoa to purchase this brand ,hot cocoa k cups , great hot chocolate
great product for keurig coffee maker works fine with coffees and cocoa is good for just hot chocolate like purchase price ,cocoa , great coffee
i enjoy the selection and they have all met my expectations so far my sister not try any favor but milk chocolate but i am glad i brought the variety pack anyway ,good cocoa , great coffee
this hot chocolate is much better than other k cup hot chocolates i have tried it is not watery i have tried both the milk and dark chocolate version and like them both ,great hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
so far grove square has the best hot chocolate k cups we have tried a couple others but they do not compare ,best hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
when i was talking to a neighbor about getting a keurig she told me not to get cocoa this was in a group of beverages that i got when i ordered my keurig and i think it is very good it is rich creamy and exactly what i want when i want a cup of cocoa i would order this again ,hot cocoa , good stuff
this hot chocolate is very good it has just the right amount of milk chocolate flavor the price is a very good deal and more than worth it ,very good hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
i do not know why i ordered these it was just on a whim but what a surprise when i brewed myself some hot chocolate the taste was unbelievable just like homemade maybe a tad too sweet but a tiny little bit of instant coffee added to it did the trick love it ,hard to believe , not as good as it is
i was expecting something more considering the keurig does such a good job with coffee br but this stuff everybody who sampled it here said it tasted just like nestle powdered hot chocolate in a mug with hot water watery sugary and nothing special ,eh why , not as good as it is
this item has an awesome chocolate flavor i would recommend this product to anyone looking for hot chocolate for their keurig or any machine that uses k cups great product ,love this , great hot chocolate
i was hoping this was a good idea however we tried them even after i heard they tasted bitter like artificial sweetner and it was true not the same as the stuff from the can ,can taste artificial sweetner , not as good as it is
ordered this in the colder weather and it was great in the morning very easy and fast to prepare in k cups ,very good , great product
i saw these on sale so i them for anything larger than a oz cup the results will be too weak i end up brewing one with oz of water and then a cappuccino or something on top of it br br the peppermint was the flavor i was anxious to try but it ended up being the dark chocolate that i loved the most i am on the fence about ordering hot cocoa k cups in the future it might be better to stick with canned cocoa and just use the water from my keurig ,i like old cocoa much better , not as good as it is
the grove square hot coco k cups have a good flavor but i find that the k cups do not have enough hot coco mix to make that perfect cup thus i recommend putting a little less water in order to make each cup just right ,grove square hot coco k cups , great hot chocolate
after drinking swiss miss watered down hot chocolates taste for so long this is a very tasty creamy hot chocolate my kids love it so i tried it and its the best i had in a while i will be ordering more ,kids love it taste best to me , great taste
a pleasant surprise me when i first ordered grove square milk chocolate hot cocoa cups not a coffee drinker br i use our keurig k cup brewer mostly to make cocoa and a few other brands i tried simply did not hit the mark grove square cocoa tasted full flavored with just enough chocolate essence to make it a perfect drink the first experience made me with pleasure the next time i popped a grove square k cup into the machine ,good taste in small , best hot chocolate ever
grove street has the absolute best hot chocolate for the keurig you should always have hot chocolate available to soothe away the days ,i love this hot chocolate for the keurig , great hot chocolate
my mom and son love the flavor of this hot chocolate add a little bit of milk afterwards and splenda and the taste is amazing ,love the flavor , great hot chocolate
i was hesitant to try this cocoa after all the horrible reviews about how it tasted so bad and had a really bad sucralose flavor i do not know if i am just not as picky as others or what it is but i thought this hot cocoa was really good creamy and rich and almost too sweet i do not think it has an aftertaste though how some have described i used the middle water setting on my keurig or small mug oz i guess everyone has their own tastes and preferences but as for me i really like this product ,creamy rich cocoa , not as good as it is
this is hands down the best tasting k cup hot chocolate available the cafe escapes or whatever the brand name is tastes very watered down and artificial while this one tastes thicker and i love the dark chocolate flavor although if i did not know it was not dark i probably could not have told the difference between it and a regular cup of cocoa i will stick with the flavor just because it will probably be richer than the milk chocolate option these are such a hit at my house when the weather is cool everyone always wants hot chocolate br br something to note on this is that these work much better when used with about oz per k cup i use k cups per mug and the flavor is much better than when i try one too watery ,best k cup hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
my grandson loves this he makes a cup everytime he stops over it quick and easy and the taste is good ,k cup cocoa , great product
as far as single serve cocoas go this is one of the best i would not say it is as good as some of the handmade ones but it is still good ,if you like hot chocolate this is great , great
nice variety pack has hot chocolates in one package milk dark and peppermint nice holiday feel good for company during the season ,worth it , good
we received this order in perfect condition i purchased this product for my mother in law she likes the convenience of the product in the keurig coffee maker the chocolate does not stick to the sides of the cup like the cheap hot chocolate in the paper bags overall it tastes pretty good it is a little weak but good use only on the small cup setting in the keurig stars ,very convenient and pretty good , not as good as i be
i bought this because it was a very good price it was really good though i love mixing a peppermint with a dark chocolate and having a double sized up of hot cocoa br br will keep buying this until they do not sell it anymore it is really creamy i like it best with ounces of water gives it a thicker feel ,really good , best hot chocolate ever
i was disappointed by the fact that all three boxes i received had already expired luckily enough the flavors had not yet br br i specifically bought these in order to get the peppermint flavor i was hoping for more the peppermint hot chocolate does not have much peppermint flavor to it but we will still enjoy it and both of the other flavors ,received product , not as good as it is
i keep this on hand for the young at heart we enjoy a cup almost every night good taste will buy again ,the , great
so if you are a person who likes swiss miss hot cocoa packets or hot cocoa from a gas station so do not get this product i can not taste any chocolate flavor in it whatsoever it just tastes like heated sugar water and nasty sugar water at that this product has a strong fake sugar taste and i am perfectly ok with diet sodas and other fake sugar products there is something about this i just can not put a finger on it but it made my stomach curl i even waited for it to cool down but it got worse very disapointed in this product and it was not what i was expecting at all ,so not what i was , not as good as it is
this is delicious hot chocolate it is best at oz cup but can be to and oz of strong coffee and you have delicious mocha ,delicious , great hot chocolate
i have had many hot cocoa k cups and i must say this one is the best by far the green mountain one has a half half bitter aftertaste while the grove square is very pleasant and is as close as you can get without actually using milk ,the best hot cocoa in a k cup , best hot cocoa ever
i really like this hot chocolate mix i was concerned when i read some of the reviews that i would not like it but i like it alot to me it has just the right amount of chocolate and is not to sweet i would recommend this product ,very good hot chocolate , not as good as it is
all this is is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a kcup delivery device what a waste of money also grove square products are inferior ,oh please get an and some hot water , great hot cocoa
my kids like this cocoa but i find flavor less delicious than the more expensive a href http www amazon com gp product b green mountain coffee hot cocoa count k cups for keurig brewers pack of a ,ok for the price not great , good coffee
very easy to use not the best flavor it has too much sugar and is not a quality i thought i was getting ,so so , best ever
the hot cocoa is delicious and is strong enough to make the larger size i find all three flavors delicious with my favorite being the dark cocoa the best bang for the buck i have so far found for hot cocoa i tend to use my coffee maker for everything but coffee ,well worth the money , great hot cocoa
very good hot chocolate i have tried a few different brands and this one is the best i have tried should be priced higher for the quality you get ,rich smooth and creamy , great hot chocolate
i have been buying this milk hot chocolate for months now and it is one of the best i have had i even got my in hooked on it and my absolutely love it great price great product ,amazon nut , great hot chocolate
just what i was looking for tired of going to the store to pick these up and always being sold out i love the flavor not so sweet and just right thank you and will be buying again ,perfect , great product
my oh my is this cocoa sweet too sweet i would say you are better off making hot cocoa from scratch i bought this because i thought the minty flavor would be good but it is too sweet so are the dark and milk chocolate flavors ,sweet , not as good as it is
i was a little skeptical when i bought this but it has really been a great purchase the cocoa is delicious it is so easy to just make my daughter and i some cocoa quickly before sitting down to watch a movie i did not have to add anything to it but i did add a tiny bit of milk just to cool it down i would definitely recommend this product and purchase it again ,hot cocoa k cups , good but not great
i did not read the reviews thoroughly and found out too late that this product has enough sugar to give it calories and grams of carbohydrate in each cup i tried one with a bit of cream and found it to be very tasty i will keep it around for friends and family or perhaps an occasional mini splurge i would like to see amazon include nutritional info in the future ,sugar and sucralose , not as good as it is
this is really tasty hot chocolate i like it much more than the dark chocolate flavor but that is just my preference ,really tasty , great hot chocolate
good value for the money these are good the hot cocoa is excellent however do not get the coffee cuz its instant ,great value , good flavor
not bad at all when i use coffeemate chocolate creamer br i still like swiss mix made with milk a little better br but as far k cups go this milk chocolate with the coffeemate chocolate creamer is not bad br and currently it is less than for cups ,not bad using chocolate , great product
this is a great hot cocoa as long as you read the box and only use the oz setting on your coffee make otherwise it will taste watered down also it is an instant coffee so dont be surprised by it ,kids will love it , great taste
the product is not bad but must brew at smallest cup size or it has no flavor definitely an aftertaste watery ,buy miss is better and cheaper , not as good as it
a hot chocolate packet was the first k cup on my new keurig it was a m and i was not ready for coffee before bed i had read they ran a little watery but i decided to try it on the oz setting took a sip and tossed it the next morning i made one with oz and added some whipped cream the taste was kind of grainy and it was still pretty watery my husband made one to try at oz and said it tasted like sugar water i might try combining oz servings to use the box up but we will not be buying more ,too watery after , not as good as it is
a good cup of hot chocolate with a couple of marshmellows make it for my daughter every time she visits she is nearly and she loves it ,good drink , great hot cocoa
all three flavors have a nice aroma and rich chocolate taste peppermint is our favorite we enjoy a cup after dinner flavored with a bit of creme liquor nearly every night it is become a tasty habit ,never without , great taste
this item had a great price and tastes great the only thing that could make this product better is if the little plastic cup was recyclable or ,love it , great product
my husband and i really like this cocoa i add extra milk to my cup for a creamier flavor but the convenience cannot be beat ,great cocoa , great hot chocolate
great deal especially for the price item arrived quicker than anticipated this has saved me many trips to dunkin as well as saving me paying double the price for a cup of hot chocolate that is just as good looking for more to ,keurig hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
love them hardly notice any aftertaste from sweetener i do not agree with some of the others that did not like it will buy again ,grove cocoa k cups , great taste
this product is nice and the price is right but it is not swiss chocolate for sure br br just does not have that real deep chocolate taste ,not chocolate , not as good as
i bought this brand of hot chocolate k cups cause it had the best review on amazon at the time the kids love it they especially like the peppermint flavor which i cannot see any other way to get except in this mixed box you get milk chocolate dark chocolate and peppermint flavors i tried it a few times and it is too weak for my taste i make it on the lowest setting on my keurig which i think is around ounces and it is still weak to me but perfect for them if you like a strong chocolate flavor this is not it ,kids love it me not so much , great taste
wow what a deal these taste just as good as the expensive brands most definately will be buying these again ,hot k cup , great taste
i feel like i have tried every hot cocoa there is in the k cups while i do think this is the best hot cocoa so far it still is not great i am not sure what it is but all of the cocoa k cups seem to have a weird taste to them it is almost like there is artificial sweetener in them but i know there is not br i set it on the smallest cup setting for cocoa this has more body to it than others br i m still waiting and hoping that dunkin donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a k cup there really is nothing better than that br if you want a k cup hot cocoa i would def recommend this over all the others ,better than the others but still not quite there , great hot chocolate
box of packets being around two dollars then go ahead and try it i will at this point and stick to using packets br br i would also like to again that despite what some comments say the cafe escapes hot cocoa k cups swiss miss hot cocoa k cups and grove square hot cocoa k cups all use sucralose yes there is sugar in some of those but it is in addition to sucralose splenda and not by itself br br so your choices right now are pure sucralose sucralose plus a sugar or pure fructose none of them is appetizing to me and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant br br servings of sugar sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks and it is no more than a k cup if you know how to operate a spoon ,why cannot make a hot cocoa without sucralose in it , not bad
these grove square hot cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the keurig we took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good br br dark chocolate my favorite very good even on the large cup setting br milk chocolate excellent on the small cup and good on the large cup setting br peppermint everyone likes this one on either cup size setting br br these do contain sucralose in addition to sugar i do not notice the taste but my wife does but she still likes them br br highly recommended br br cfh ,really good hot cocoa highly recommended , great hot chocolate
excellent product a tip from the keurig people shake the k cup before using it this prevents the cocoa from clumping and results in more flavor ,great flavor , great coffee
marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too so maybe a few mini marshmallows instead of a full sized one for this flavor oh and definitely go oz cup my oldest granddaughter and i for the peppermint chocolate she wins of course but it is pretty good when i can get one no marshmallow needed the hint of peppermint is just enough oz cup on this one is the best way to go too br br i think i got the cups sizes right if i didn t you will figure it out btw i would imagine the reason it is always out of stock is because people keep buying it i have dipped into the supply well a few times myself pretty good pretty cheap pretty hard to get at times i will buy it again ,not bad not bad at all , not bad but not great
everyone in my family likes hot cocoa i was running plain water through my k cup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids did not really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow so i decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time no overflow the taste is good its creamy with enough cocoa to water ratio for my kids i will be ordering this product from now on for my family br in the interest of product comparison we have ordered timothy white hot chocolate and green mountain hot cocoa timothy was great but pricy and green mountain did not really taste all that great to our family it had a watered down taste to it ,perfect cocoa , great hot chocolate
when i weigh the convenience of a k cup against the price and the taste i would these as a winner not the best cup of cocoa on the planet but compared to making it yourself or using a packet these are pretty darn good they nice a nice chocolate flavor with no funny after taste that i have had with some other brands do not select oz on your machine though make it only at or oz otherwise it will be watery in my opinion all in all a fine cup of hot chocolate ,tasty and at a great price , not as good as it is
love to drink hot cocoa and cider pretty much year round br br price point the price for these at the store exact brand is almost triple of what we pay here for the same amount with subscribe and save this makes these quite affordable for my family use in comparison to other more expensive brands it is a great bargain without sacrificing quality over quantity br br flavor wise my kids love it and have already asked me to purchase more my daughter says that the peppermint is right on and not too weak even if using a larger cup i love the dark chocolate in my coffee to make a mocha oz coffee to oz chocolate and it is much better than some other brands that i have tried in the past br br overall impression great value good flavor excellent price point i will be purchasing more ,much better than expected great for the kids , great taste
ordered on a whim my first grove square purchase great for the family occasional cocoa desire being a k cup it is fast and easy was a little worried the cocoa might leave some after taste in my coffee so far so good great cup of dark rich cocoa maybe could taste a little better if it was from a gourmet brand you mix yourself with steamed milk the ease and and lack of clean up make this a better option for me will order again nice to see it on subscribe and save ,rich thick cocoa surprisingly good , not as good as it is
my box of grove square hot cocoa arrived today and i have just tried it delicious made a big cup by mistake but i am happy with the flavor and consistency no off tastes that i can discern a little disappointed at high sodium content nice to have as fall starts to chill ,surprised , great hot chocolate
i really really dislike sucralose i do not like the taste the aftertaste or the after effects i bought this based on it not saying it was diet or low calorie the first ingredient is sugar so it is only partially sweetened with sucralose sucralose is way down in the ingredients list but the taste is noticeable br br sure wish amazon contained the full nutrition and ingredients labels from all food products ,sucralose , not as good as it is
ok this is not the finest european chocolate but you can make it in your keurig and all flavors taste good i have the club and get the lowest possible cost no charge to join and no effort to quit why not it is nice to have when you are dieting because it is just enough chocolate to keep you on track non dieters will like it for the convenience ,tasty and good for weight , not as good as it is
i have tried a few different hot cocoa brands for my keurig and have been disappointed every time until now cocoa brews smooth and full flavored on either the small cup size or the medium i add a splash of almond milk and i am ready to go perfect i will definitely buy this again ,yummy , great hot chocolate
i recieved a keurig k cup brewer for christmas with sample cups of coffee and tea but no cocoa so i tried this brand and i like them but i have not tried other brands yet to compare with i would buy these again until i find one i like better ,hot cocoa , great tea
i see a lot of complaints about grove square hot chocolate i think it tastes ok considering it is a k cup not homemade and not gourmet i do not have anything negative to say the company or the product it is relatively inexpensive and the company did not advertise or make any promises about the taste ,k cups , great hot chocolate
i really like hot cocoa i like it sooo much that i have a cocoa latte machine which is great but sometimes i just want one cup of cocoa not a whole pitcher when that happens i used to put on the kettle and heat up the water then pour in a packet of cocoa mix and stir and stir and stir and after all that stirring i would still get little lumps in my cocoa with the k cups i get smooth rich cocoa with no lumps and no clean up easy and yummy br br please note these are not sugar free the very first ingredient in each flavor is sugar and i did not see any artifical sugar listed in the ingredients each cup has only calories but if you want sugar free or are diabetic then this product is probably not for you ,not bad not bad at all , not as good as it is
very good hot cocoa and price was right br br awesome and passing the word on the item will buy it again ,taste great , great hot cocoa
the thing i like most about this brand of hot chocolate is that once i remove it from the keurig it does not leak all over the place for some reason all the hot chocolates i have purchased before leak all over when you remove them from the coffee pot my coffee does not do that so not sure why that is this is a great deal for the amount you get as well and taste yummy ,yummy , great taste
i found this brand and the fact that it was dark chocolate made it by far the best i have had for my keurig i will continue to order this particular brand ,best ever , best ever
i love these hot chocolates i think they are way better than the cafe express hot chocolates these and the swiss miss hot chocolate are my favorite k cups and the price of these are the best i have been able to find my girlfriend and i have already gone through about half of them in about two weeks and i never used to drink much hot chocolate br i recommend these ,good hot chocolate , great taste
i really enjoy this hot chocolate with a little fat free half half for creaminess being that i am not a coffee drinker these k cups offer a nice change from tea the local stores sell this as well but it is half the amount of cups and almost the same price buy from amazon ,yummy , great taste
i like to brew a k cup cocoa into my coffee for a nice mocha this dark chocolate flavor is quite nice especially mixed with double black diamond coffee though not the very best it is good and the price is right compared to other brands ,not bad for the price , good coffee
since i am willing to try alot of new things i thought that i would buy this product and since i do like hot cocoa i bought boxes worst thing i could have done this is bland with very little flavour it also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mug br personally i will not buy this product again i will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa brand for the keurig k cup ,nasty , not as good as it is
does not have a rich chocolate flavor tastes a little watery not sure who a makes a great cocoa but this is not it ,grove square hot cocoa , not as good as it is
taste was decent a little sugary but very creamy otherwise very happy with this product i will be buying this product again packaging interesting as it is a giant box for the product to float around in until it delivers to your house ,pleased with it , not as good as it is
grove square hot chocolate is the best k cup hot chocolate i read many reviews before making this purchase and now i agree and will continue to buy this brand ,grove square hot chocolate is the best , great hot chocolate
my kids have been begging for hot cocoa k cups and when i found these so reasonably priced i decided to give them a try we all loved them ,great hot chocolate and price , great hot chocolate
this tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and does not taste very chocolatey the name brand cocoa are better or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better ,tastes off , not as good as it is
all three tastes rich and chocolaty not chalky at all we were surprised how good they are better than any other k cup cocoa we have tried ,is our favorite , great product
just plain nasty this item tasted like cardboard very watered down and no flavor to it at all very disappointed ,horrible , great product
this brand is by far the best k cup hot cocoa not that that says much but it is thicker and less disgusting than the rest ,best k cup hot cocoa , best hot cocoa ever
thin runny and the fake milk powder used to add creaminess has an off flavor better off eating your mug ,not good , great product
you cannot beat this deal boxes of k cups for little more then no other store can even match that price for hot chocolate k cups your normally going to be paying around for k cups alone this package give you k cups for a great price br br the hot chocolate itself is great tasting and can be used on mostly all settings for the b except for the travel mug low in calories and great tasting defiantly a must have if you own a keurig brewing system ,great tasting great value , great hot cocoa
not too sweet the best k cup hot chocolate i have tried thus far the kids loved drinking and making the hot chocolate ,tasty , great taste
grove square is the best k cup hot cocoa i have tried and i have tried a number of the other brands this tastes like real cocoa used to taste and if you add a little milk it is even better it is so hot from the keurig that the milk helps cool it down anyway if your looking for a real chocolate flavor give this a try ,best hot cocoa , great hot chocolate
i do not expect great hot chocolate from a k cup but it should at least taste like there is some cocoa in it i cannot believe how bad this stuff tastes i tried it times and then threw the rest away ,really awful , not as good as it is
best hot chocolate available for k cups best taste after taste great in any size when brewed highly recommend over any other company ,best hot chocolate for k cups , great hot cocoa
of the few hot cocoa flavors we have tried this is the best so far it has the richest flavor and i dont notice the artificial taste that others have commented on its also very affordable compared to other k cups right now i thought that the k cup making process must have gotten more expensive over the last year but now i know they are truely sticking it to us since these are still reasonable priced ,good flavor and the , great hot chocolate
this is the absolute best hot cocoa for the keurig brewers all of the other hot cocoa that we have tried we had to doctor to make them taste good we had to add more cocoa and more sugar i was pretty much making my own cocoa which the purpose of the brewer but the grove square hot cocoa does not need any help in my opinion it has just the right amount of flavor ,favorite hot cocoa , great hot cocoa
oh so good the first cup i had was on the medium setting it was too sweet so i had my second on the larger setting and it was perfect this is a creamy hot chocolate add a little milk and and whipped cream and your set ,yummy , great taste
i was quite pleased with e flavor of this product a good strong yet not overpowering flavor rich chocolate flavor very pleasing i highly recomend this product ,yummy hot chocolate , great product
i am giving this product stars because i think it is great considering that it is made with water the hot chocolate is best if you shake the cup and then brew using the smallest possible cup size if you want a large cup of hot chocolate use k cups it is fairly low in calories most likely because artificial sweeteners are necessary to get all the ingredients into the little k cup ,pretty good hot chocolate , best hot cocoa ever
i wish i had listened to the other bad reviews the artificial sweetener taste is awful i gave two stars only because my husband does not seem to mind i cannot drink this even if they were a bargain ,should have to other bad reviews , not as good as it is
better than expected but the peppermint flavor lacks a mint smell or taste this is a good purchase for the price ,good buy , good but not great
i looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa but was very disappointed with the flavor it has an awful aftertaste like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda also kind of weak even on the smallest cup setting ,tastes like a diet product , not as good as it is
so bad i returned it my children did not even like it and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food ,not good , not as good as it
kcups are a godsend among kcups these are near the top br br the keurig brewer is a blessing hot beverages in seconds mostly coffee but there are greater and among the coffees and so it seems among the hot cocoas br br this is so rich and vibrant it itself from two rooms away silky smooth bursting with all the things chocolate is supposed to deliver it is a must have in this household ,chocolate heaven , good but not great
this is the best hot cocoa i have tried for the keurig rich chocolate flavor i used the oz setting and it is not watery if you like hot cocoa and the convenience of a k cup this is the one to get ,awesome , great hot cocoa
i bought this for my daughter and grandson they both tried it at different times and they both said it had a funny taste and did not drink it therefore i will not buy it again ,taste , not as good as
the artificial sweetener ruined this for me it leaves the fake sugar taste in your mouth and my husband who drinks diet soda even noticed at least it was not pricey ,artificial sweetener yuck , not as good as it is
grove square milk chocolate cocoa k cups are great i usually make hot cocoa from scratch with milk over the stove i thought this was easier and delicious to add creaminess i put in either a splash of milk or a shot of whipped cream perfect ,yum , great hot chocolate
i ordered the hot cocoa for my grandson for christmas he loves the flavor and is able to make it on his own delivery was good i had it in several days but still in plenty of time for christmas would recommend to anyone ,well pleased , great hot chocolate
good flavors in this combo not really strong but i will just set the machine on less water next time ,good flavor , good but not great
love this brand great price with save and subscribe my husband loves them top with whipped cream in a can and i have a happy man i wish you could buy all cocoa ,great product great price is outstanding , great product
great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa k cups have i have tasted several and this by far is the better one but i have to say anything larger than oz tastes a bit watered down will definitely purchase more but at the rate my family these we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective ,great taste the whole family loves , great taste
i ordered this as a christmas present for my daughter and son in law he tried it the day after christmas and gave it thumbs up ,hot cocoa , great product
i bought a box of grove square hot cocoa because i love their cappuccino french vanilla i used the medium cup setting and added some whipped cream it was to die for very yummy and almost as good as homemade i never noticed an aftertaste like other reviews but it could be because of the whip i added to it i highly recommend it ,very good hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
my wife rates this stars she is the chocoholic in the family and if you please her you please everybody ,grove hot chocolate , great product
i love the flavor that this hot chocolate has it is very rich and smooth have tried other brands but did not get the results i wanted i will definately be ordering from this company again ,good and tasty , great hot chocolate
got a brand new keurig machine for christmas and immediately went to work finding the cheapest and best tasting k cups on the market i came across this when searching for some good hot cocoa and am amazed at how many k cups you really get out of this k cups for about when i purchased was a great deal when most hot chocolate prices were k cups for br br this is a great deal and you get to try out peppermint dark chocolate and milk chocolate it is light on calories and most important of all taste great br br must have if your a hot chocolate lover or have family that wants a easy to make great tasting hot chocolate for less ,great deal great cocoa , great hot chocolate
fantastic cocoa all the flavors are excellent but my personal favorite is the dark chocolate i received my keurig as a christmas present and i am loving cocoa at the end of the work day no mixing no microwave and positively no pot on the stove just warm chocolatey goodness on demand will order this product again ,great , great hot chocolate
after trying many of the other hot cocoa k cup options i find that the grove square product tastes the best for my personal taste i find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste just add marshmellows and it is a great treat however this is not hot chocolate which may be a turn off for some ,best tasting cocoa k cup available , great hot chocolate
i have tried a number of k cup hot chocolates and grove square is by far the best yet very nice flavor doesnt have the nasty artificial sweetener flavor like a lot of the kcup hot chocolates very impressed ,finally a good k cup hot chocolate , great coffee
i enjoy a good cup of hot cocoa on occasion and this is good stuff not only that but in a time where prices are out of control on k cups this product is very reasonable in price ,good cocoa great price , good cocoa
i bought these for my mom and she loves it she mixed eggnog with the dark chocolate she enjoyed melting candies in too ,great , great product
i bought this mostly because i wanted the peppermint hot cocoa but i fell in love with the milk chocolate one the peppermint was pretty good as well good cocoa ,great , great hot chocolate
with a nice cookbook which was the real present and wrapped it real unfortunately the boss ended up with it i have not asked him if his family enjoyed it because i do not want to put him on the spot judging by the reviews there are a lot of people who like it hopefully he will too maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove with milk cocoa and sugar and maybe a tiny pinch of salt compared to that this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment br br anyway instead of trying one of the other brands i now heat some milk in the microwave stir in a couple spoonfuls of hershey cocoa and some sugar to taste it takes about three minutes and it is delicious now where did i put those mini marshmallows ,so bad i had it away , not as good as it is
sometimes i would rather have cocoa instead of coffee at work this meets my cocoa craving i do not need to add sugar just add water and brew ,this the , not as good as
everything you would want from a hot chocolate creamy milky tasty makes you happy i cannot wait to try the other flavors ,yummy , great hot chocolate
i have tried many brands of the hot chocolates but this by far has been the best now i realize it is percent cheaper to just use the package you can buy at the store and add water but if you want to impress than this is the product ,delicious , best hot chocolate ever
having tried all the varieties of hot chocolate k cups grove square are by far the best they are very chocolaty rich creamy and leave very little sludge in the bottom of your cup yum ,excellent hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
i must say i was pleasantly surprised i do not drink coffee and i was searching for more hot chocolates for my keurig i am a milk chocolate fan but with grove square the peppermint and dark chocolate are by far the better choice both have a sweetness i was not expecting the flavor is great and i do not want to share i am definitely reordering more ,best hot cocoa ever , good coffee
this is by far the best hot cocoa i have found yet for the keurig i love the assortment and the peppermint is my favorite i would give these try for sure if you are looking for some hot cocoa k cups all the other selections for hot cocoa that i have tried were just okay tasting these are amazing love them i will order these for sure again ,best hot cocoa yet , great hot cocoa
i just got a keurig a few weeks ago and wanted to get some hot chocolate for it as an alternative to coffee i did not have super high expectations but these are absolutely awful there is a very strong plastic chemical taste to these k cups i tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help the only reason i gave these k cups stars is because my boyfriend can tolerate them but i do not trust him because he will eat just about anything in his opinion they are not that good but he will still drink the mug br br from what i have read of other hot chocolate k cups you would be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way ,horrible taste , not as good as i have
after being disgusted by the brown water created by the cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa we were thrilled to find these dark chocolate cocoa k cups delicious ,so much better than cafe , great taste
this is the best keurig k cup hot chocolate you can buy i have tried others but will never buy any other brand again ,the best , best k cup hot cocoa
this hot chocolate tasted very good the whole family liked it it is a nice change to make hot chocolate instead of coffee keurig coffee maker we purchase this again ,grove square hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
we had previously tried another brand of hot coca k cups we bought these since they seemed to be a pretty good value we actually like the taste and flavor of these more than the other brand we tried they have just the right amount of cocoa and sweetness we like the variety of flavors in the pack also ,great hot cocoa , great taste
i am so glad that this hot chocolate is available for keurig previously the brand of hot chocolate available was only so so but this is definitely better the variety pack is just right for every mood and every guest i never find myself with too much of any one flavor left over move over coffee lovers we cocoa drinkers have found a home ,great , great hot cocoa
i have tried a few of the cocoa cups and find this product about average unless you stir the cup the cocoa will taste watery for a few sips ,good not great , great taste
i have heard over and over that people are having a difficult time finding a hot chocolate pod to enjoy in their keurig k cup brewers the search is over this grove square hot cocoa received four big smiles from my sons they just went on and on about how delicious it was i love having this new coffee pot where it is fast and convenient for all of us super happy with this purchase ,yummy , great coffee
reasonable in price tastes good for keurig which can be pricey we will probably buy this again it is mostly for the anyway ,good for the money , great product
completely of water so i do add a splash of half and half to my cup when i make this thus i did not want to give it a star rating since i do doctor my cup up a bit at home otherwise i would have however i will not even venture to make a cup of hot chocolate in a packet from the grocery store with water i use milk usually for those and they still do not measure up to this product from grove square so the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me i do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that i have ever tried at home compared to the swiss miss in the cupboard this had a distinctly grown up taste to it i am a big fan ,yum , good but not great
great product at a reasonable price my husband favorite loves the dark chocolate although we get the pack of that includes light dark and peppermint also shopped around and this is a bargain and surpasses the other cocoa k cups we have tried in taste ,great product , great hot chocolate
i bought this item for my elderly mom to use with the new keurig coffee machine i purchased for her she loves it i will be ordering more ,excellent product , great coffee
bought this as a gift and was told it tastes really great too bad i do not have one of those machines otherwise i would try them out myself i might have to consider getting one if you really like it you can save some money by to it for automatic deliveries and to make sure you do not run out ,tastes great , not as good as it is
this is great hot chocolate not watery like some others and my husband really likes this one thank you pat id ,yummy and amazon too , great hot chocolate
we love this variety box in our house we subscribe to ensure we never run out i use the dark to make mocha my wife loves the peppermint and i drink the milk whenever i fancy a hot chocolate br br the dark makes a great mocha just do half a cup of the dark cocoa and half a cup of your favorite coffee add whipped cream on top delicious also worth noting you can try some of the flavored coffees in your mocha and up some great i am not a fan of flavored coffee i struggle to drink a cup but as a mocha delightful br br drinking the peppermint or milk as a hot chocolate we add a little milk and whipped cream on top delicious br br i highly recommend this variety box if you are considering buying it ,perfect hot variety box , great coffee
well you get what you paid for while this milk chocolate k cup is pretty cheap per cents per count but it is not good it tasted like watered down chocolate as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate cacao for that matter this thing is sweet tho in fact kinda too sweet for my taste i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugar sweetener i thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so i lowered the cup size from ounce to ounce on my keurig brewer and it is the same thing ,you get what you for , not as good as it is
i have tried ever single brand of k cup hot chocolate and this is absolutely the best one it is the only one that actually tastes like the real stuff ,the best of all of them , great hot cocoa
great price for the count my dad will love this gift since he loves hot chocolate and drinks about three cups a day quick to receive ,hot cocoa cups , great hot chocolate
it appears a little watery but the taste is not bad at all if you have kids that are as by the keurig as you are they will probably enjoy this ,surprisingly good , not as good as it is
i enjoy this cocoa very much the children love it and drink it often i would purchase this product again ,very good hot cocoa , great hot chocolate
for the price i think the cocoa cups are very good i will order them again they are nice to have in the house for the grand children and the holidays ,hot cocoa , good but not great
great tasting product and is much better than other cocoas i have tasted in this type of single serve job well dont grove square ,great product , great taste
this is the best cocoa ever it beats out anything you can buy in the store sometimes br i just mix it in my coffee and it is wonderful highly recommend ,hot cocoa , great hot cocoa
it is a pretty good sub for the coffee shop version no mess and the s s price is great i like that the box has to remove part of the side so that it as a dispenser ,yummy , not as good as
i like it ok but it is not anything great i have a hot water tap and it is just as easy for me to make the powder packs at home at a fraction of the cost i will go back to that method and save my for coffee ,not bad but same taste as powder packs at store , the best
this is actually better than i expected when i paid less than cents each we usually use a packet mix and hot water from the brewer this is much easier and the taste is comparable if you are very particular you may not like this but for something quick sweet chocolate flavored and warm for around cents it is worth a try i would not buy it at the regular price that some ask ,very good for the price , not as good as it is
getting really good cocoa out of a k cup is not easy but this is much better than the others i have tried still a little but at calories it is a nice treat very rich flavor not as good as the real thing bit i am not drinking it in a chocolate shop either put your on sit in front of the with your and enjoy br br cal fat g fat sat carb g sugar lt g fiber ,best dark cocoa so fat , good but not great
this hot chocolate is great am so glad i doubled the order you can not miss with this now i have quick hot chocolate for the kids and grandkids ,wow , great hot chocolate
this is much too watery it tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine after receiving the box and reading the list of ingredients i have decided not to order again this product if definitely not worth the money ,not good , not as good as it is
we recieved the product on time and in excellent shape it tastes good and meets our expectations thanks for the excellent service ,grove square k cups , great product
but not overly so and the richness made me check the calorie count on the box calories hey not too bad it was not until now that i came back to place a review and i read the most recent reviews from others did i realize they use artificial sweetener honestly if i had not read it i would have never known i did not detect anything that gave me the hint when i drank it br br i think if you like a quick cocoa on the run you will be happy enough with these k cups are they as good as a swiss miss packet from costco maybe not but in my office i do not want to deal with getting powder on the and needing a spoon to get things mixed you will sacrifice a little for the convenience but to me it is well worth it ,pretty good not as bad as others are , not as good as it is
unfortunately i am with my purchase br br although the final product was quite good stars the quality of the delivery is why they lost an additional star i opened the amazon box to find that there was hot chocolate powder coming out of the grove square packaging i opened it to find that of the k cups were not sealed properly on top and were spilling into the box i both the amazon package and the grove square both of which had no visible exterior damage br br i was disappointed with both grove square for the quality of their product and as a result i am not sure i would buy this product again ,mixed reviews , not as good as it is
everything about the order went great the hot chocolate is very good i will be ordering this again soon ,hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
the flavor of this cocoa is good but i found that it was a little too watered down with the normal amount to water the second cup was better when i used less water ,a little thin , good but not great
i recently purchased a keurig and i bought the cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa from their site and it was not chocolately and had a strange aftertaste i saw the grove square brand and thought i would give it a try since i got kcups for less than the from keurig i received my purchase yesterday and immediately opened it up to try it the cocoa actually has sugar in it and the chocolately flavor is much better than the cafe escapes i will be ordering this one again and i hope my guest will drink the other kind to get rid of it ,much better and less expensive than that ordered from keurig , not as good as it is
than green mountain but a bit high for something that diet conscious people would want and the ingredient list did not seem to point to obvious diet sweeteners br br the overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar free tootsie roll in your hot water using the normal cup setting going one size down did not seem to improve much beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter but that just meant a heavier shot of low calorie sweetener to the taste buds br br the way i see it i saved about by going with this brand on the other hand now i have got of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if i cannot sucker someone er please my discerning guests with a few cups br br if you drink diet soft drinks by choice you are probably going to like this ,at least it was not expensive , not bad but not bad
we have tried many of the different hot cocoa k cups everything always tasted so watered down even when using the smallest setting on the machine however this brand even at the medium cup setting tasted fantastic i highly recommend grove square i have not tried any of their other products but i would be inclined to now based on this cocoa ,surprisingly good , great hot cocoa
grove square hot cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the keurig we took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good br br dark chocolate my favorite very good even on the large cup setting br milk chocolate excellent on the small cup and good on the large cup setting br peppermint everyone likes this one on either cup size setting br br these do contain sucralose in addition to sugar i do not notice the taste but my wife does but she still likes them br br highly recommended we tried these in the smaller variety pack a href http www amazon com gp product b k q k grove square hot cocoa cups variety pack k cups for keurig brewers count pack of a br br cfh ,really good hot cocoa highly recommended , great hot cocoa
this tastes terrible like putting sweetener in already sweet hot chocolate the best i have tried so far is swiss miss hot chocolate k cups do not think they are sold on amazon yet ,too much artificial sweetner , best hot chocolate ever
had i known this cocoa was sugar free i would not have purchased it i realize that this will not bother some people but i really do not like the aftertaste of fake sugar in the interest of this did not seem to trouble my nephew just update the description ,the does not that it is sugar free , not as good as it is
my whole family people tasted all flavors and they are sickly sweet very disappointed that product has sucralose i would not buy it again ,why does this have sucralose , delicious
using oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak it was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup using oz made the cocoa much too sweet and still too weak in the chocolate department it uses sucralose as a sweetener which gives it a very sweet flavor this may not be a problem for those who like very sweet things or do not mind the taste of sucralose unfortunately i am not one of those people ,too sweet too weak , not as good as it is
perhaps not your grandma cup of hot chocolate but for the keurig it is the best out there and what makes it a sweeter deal you get packs for the typical price of k cup box take note it is a pack of so a total of k cups br br i suggest only using the small cup setting to prevent it from being watered down too much but decide for yourself ,best hot cocoa for keurig , great hot cocoa
i was not expecting too much with this but thought i would give it a try for something different for my keurig i have to say that i was pleasantly surprised at how good this is my favorite is the dark chocolate but the peppermint is very good as well i am not a real milk chocolate fan but i mixed it with some coffee for a mocha and it was very good i would definitely purchase this again ,surprisingly good , good coffee
as you know finding a hot chocolate that taste great and is brewed on the keurig is a big challenge well this hot chocolate is quite good the flavor is rich and the hot chocolate has some creaminess to it i made it for my daughter and it off with whipped cream and she loved it will be drinking lots of this on now that it is to get colder ,best hot cocoa for keurig , great hot chocolate
although this is not a perfect cup of cocoa it is far superior to the others that i have tried i will order this again ,not perfect but better than the , great cocoa
this is by far the best k cup hot cocoa we have tried it has a nice rich flavor and with the added convenience of a k cup it is easy to have a cup anytime you like highly recommend ,excellent hot cocoa , best k cup hot cocoa
out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that i have tried this is by far the best one not weird aftertaste and not watered down tastes amazing and priced fairly what more could you ask for ,fantastic , best hot chocolate ever
these k cups are just what my son wanted the price was excellent and the flavor is rich i would recommend these to anyone wanting a good cup of instant hot cocoa ,delicious , great taste
i am a big hot cocoa drinker so this hot cocoa i would definitely recommend it has a great cocoa flavor and it is perfect for those cold fall or winter days you up plus tastes great ,great cocoa , great hot cocoa
cannot tell you how this tastes because i read the ingredients first but it has trans fats in every flavor the seller should all ingredients in the description i would not have purchased this otherwise ,contains , not as good as it is
i received my order of grove square hot cocoa mix today and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix i have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood levels i would urge amazon to require an list of ingredients for all food items listed for sale if the ingredients had been listed those of us who have concerns about our health can avoid these products ,very , not as good as it is
few items from the nutrition info br br calories from fat trans fat g sodium mg sugars g br br ingredients sugar glucose syrup solids cocoa processed with alkali partially hydrogenated vegetable oil may contain coconut soybean sunflower palm and or canola modified whey maltodextrin salt natural and artificial flavors gum sodium caseinate cornstarch lactose dipotassium phosphate sucralose mono and diglycerides silicon dioxide soy lecithin artificial color contains milk and soy br br i always hate seeing artificial coloring in dark chocolate products br br if i had hot chocolate every day i would consider making it from scratch with more cocoa and fewer chemicals but since i enjoy the convenience of having it nearly instantly from my keurig on the occasional whim i will just keep a box of these k cups on hand i highly recommend it for the taste it is not easy finding good hot chocolate ,dark chocolate lover best i have tried , a great product
this does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use i is just not good ,not good , not as good as
really wanted to love this hot cocoa i tried all three flavors multiple times in different ways i tried them on the different cup sizes adding things etc there is just this strange taste to them that does not sit well on the tongue i am not sure what it is but it has a faint ring of sour milk it really lingers and i have not found anything that takes the taste away i am going to give my second box to a friend she does not seem to notice it my daughter and husband both said it tasted weird so it is not just me i also took it to a friend house and have tried them in three different keurig machines just to make sure mine did not need to be so i guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes ,not bad but not good either , not bad but not great
i ordered this product because of a good price deal amazon shipped accordingly absolutely no problems there however the taste of this product was horrendous it tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it i personally will go back to buying swiss miss in a can and just using the keurig to give me hot water cheaper and much better tasting ,bad taste , not as good as it is
this has to be without a doubt the worst tasting hot chocolate ever the best way to describe the taste of this stuff is really cheap free instant hot chocolate swiss miss instant is way better and cost less after only cups threw the rest in the garbage where it and canceled my subscribe and save for this slop ,worst hot chocolate ever , not as good as it is
this is okay cocoa it is not really very smooth and it is a little watery i had high hopes as i love dark chocolate hot cocoa and the reviews were good i will finish the box i bought but will try another brand next time ,it is decent , not as good as it is
just got a new keurig and was looking for a great drink still looking this is fair at best watery and nothing to brag about ,nothing special , best ever
i have not actually tried drinking these just as hot cocoa but i know the peppermint flavor is great as a creamer for the van houtte mexican coffee i m ordering another box as this adds just the right amount of chocolate to my coffee been trying to find a coffee flavor that does that but so far adding these to the coffee has worked out better i usually have oz at a time so i run oz through as hot chocolate and the other as coffee i did try another brand of kcup hot cocoa and it was not as good as this brand ,great as a or added chocolate , good coffee but not a great price
we have a new hot beverage cooker this thing is the closest thing to the made know via star movies and series of various br br we love our hot beverage brewer and have added a higher end unit to our own home environment br br we ve used such a device and various coffee and tea pods over the last few years but this kit tops that experience br br i especially like the hot chocolate and tea beverages apart from the hundreds of coffee options br br do consider buying one of their and also sample the so very many flavors of coffees teas and other hot beverages attached to the brewing station ,the of our time , great taste
i would never heard of this brand but they were very cheap here on amazon and i was extremely surprised at how good the dark chocolate hot cocoa is absolutely worth trying it is really quite good ,delicious , great hot chocolate
this is the best hot cocoa i have found so far but i hope i can find better it is not real chocolately wish it were a bit sweeter but on the whole i would buy it again if i cannot find better ,it is ok best i have found so far , best hot cocoa ever
this is really great hot chocolate the price is right too usually i find that hot chocolate k cups are weak or watery but not this one i was impressed the dark chocolate is really yummy i will be ordering more ,great hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
close i can almost enjoy a cup but it is still unmistakable especially if you do not consume much artificial sweetener i chew sugar free gum and that is it for me br br it a shame too because the chocolate flavor is nice in fact i rated these a simply because my son the sweetener enough to drink them and i was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before i found out about the sweetener but now i will not be buying any side note many cappuccino reviewers complained that they are instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino that would be fine with me if it were not for the artificial sweetener which those gas station do not have br br if they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener i would buy it but until then i am staying away from grove square products ,why oh why add sugar , not as good as it is
we use our keurig every day when a friend gave us a sample we went crazy it is the best hot chocolate ever i highly recommend this it is a treat in the evening to take the place of dessert ,grove square hot cocoa cups dark single serve cup , great hot cocoa
i guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page does not mention that the first ingredient is trans fat partially hydrogenated oil had i know i would not have purchased this consumers need to vote with their dollars and avoid buying items where the manufacturer is using cheap and unhealthy ingredients ,first ingredient is fat oil , not as good as it is
please stay away from artificial sweetners br br some of them actually change the shape of human cells br br this has an artificial sweetner ,grove square , not as good as
i have been trying every type of k cup i can get my hands on since i got my keurig for christmas and until now have not encountered any that i truly hate until i discovered this one i would have though it pretty difficult to ruin hot chocolate but the people at grove square certainly did a good job not only was the hot chocolate watery but it had a horrible plastic aftertaste also yuck ,mmmmm plastic , not as good as it is
i ordered this specifically b c they said dark chocolate so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor they taste very watery even using the lowest amount of water on the keurig the nutritional fact show that it only has grams of sugar where the normal store bought powder has grams i did not like these at all if you are going for something low sugar they might be for you ,taste like diet , not as good as it is
i read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k cup on the market and decided to try this one first its not good even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct taste i think that this an problem with all the k cup hot chocolates you just cannot fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it does not taste watered down i am going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way ,not good , not as good as it is
just tried this for the first time today they are ok but they do have an odd aftertaste not sure i will be ordering these again also the packaging notes that you need to run a hot water cycle without a k cup after making them i assume to clean the machine out ,ok but has a aftertaste , not as good as it is
compared to other k cup products grove square offers tasty products at a reasonable price this hot cocoa was rich and delicious ,great , great hot chocolate
i ordered the dark hot cocoa in hopes it would be real chocolatey and it was no better than buying a pouch of hot chocolate and adding it to hot water i actually think the pouch added to hot water is loads better and a whole lot cheaper v e r y d i a p p o i n t e d for the price it a rip off ,w e a k not worth the cost , not as good as it is
the cocoa was not too bad the taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes i was disappointed though when i went to a local store and saw it for less than what i paid just for shipping i really thought i was getting a good deal until i went home and checked the ticket i just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house so ,cocoa was not bad price was horrible , not as good as it is
this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredients br no real peppermint is in this product and to be honest it doesnt even taste like real cocoa is either ,not quality at all , not as good as
i cannot believe i did not check out the ingredients for this i never would have bought it if i would have known there was artificial sweetener in it first cup though i got that weird after taste it gives and that was all she wrote if you do not have a problem with a chemical taste or concerns about health problems you may like it not worth it to us ,i wish i would have , not as good as it is
found my kids actually cutting open the pods and dumping them into a cup to add hot water too they complained that lots of the good stuff stays in the pod kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging so we switched back to packets ,not worth it bad , not as good as it is
great hot chocolate by far the best kcup hot chocolate i have found i use a little milk or half and half and it is so good i definitely will order again thanks for the super fast shipping ,wonderful hot cocoa , great hot chocolate
my whole family loves this product often times we struggle to find something like this that we can all have some members of my family have severe nut allergies this product is nut free and clearly states what the ingredients are ,delish , best ever
unlike some others this is actually in a k cup and not just an overpriced version of swiss miss while the flavor is not super premium like a godiva or it is better than your average instant mix and much better than the other weak k cup versions i have had the sucralose does give it an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweetness of a commercial cake mix but it is not unpleasant br br i like to brew this on the smallest setting oz and then add milk to fill the cup and warm it in the microwave i think that gives a richer taste the peppermint is my favorite followed by the dark and then the light chocolate they are all very good my only wish is that i could buy the peppermint on its own and not in a combo pack only ,very k cup hot chocolate , not as good as it is
these are the only kind of cocoa k cups i have tried as i have a fairly new machine my only complaint is that it seems like the taste of chocolate in the milk chocolate version needs a bit of a boost however i usually add another teaspoon of regular cocoa mix and the taste is great the peppermint and dark chocolate k cups are delicious definitely worth a shot for this great price ,pretty good , good but not great
whole family liked all three flavors we have had some of the other brands of hot chocolates and they were good also but just could not get myself to pay that much for hot chocolate the price was right on these for sure but i was skeptical after reading reviews on the coffees made by this brand but it is just hot chocolate so i figured what the heck all three are actually plenty chocolaty on the biggest size serving honestly i think they are a little bit better than the other brands we have had ,good stuff , not as good as it is
what i really like about this selection is the choice of three different hot cocoa chocolates my favorite is the mint chocolate for it not only tastes like mint chocolate but it has the aroma of a hot mint chocolate the milk chocolate and dark chocolate are equally flavorful as well the price through amazon is very reasonable ,nice flavor , great taste
on our keurig and made sure to shake it to make sure the powder was loose in the k cup the k cup was completely empty after brewing there is sucralose in it but i could not detect the aftertaste of it i am pretty sensitive to that aftertaste i will buy this product again br br here are facts on the box br br calories fat saturated g sodium mg carbs g fiber lt g sugars g protein g if it is not listed it is br br the ingredients list for this is br sugar glucose syrup solid cocoa processed with alkali partially hydrogenated vegetable oil may contain coconut soybean sunflower palm and or canola nonfat dry milk modified whey maltodextrin salt natural and artificial flavors gum sodium caseinate cornstarch lactose dipotassium phosphate sucralose mono and diglycerides dioxide silicon dioxide soy lecithin artificial color contains milk and soy ,wonderful , not as good as you like
the price is wonderful the hot cocoa tastes great in and oz but oz was a bit watery to me br dark chocolate yum br milk chocolate is very yummy br peppermint for me was not enough peppermint but i just add a candy cane to mine br i would recommend this again and plan on ordering more soon ,good chocolate , great hot chocolate
we prefer the swiss miss brand k cup this one was watery in both milk and dark chocolate this is my least favorite of all k cup brands ,not my favorite , great taste
nice price and glad to see a subscribe save option on k cups however this was undrinkable in our opinion did not seem to be too watery like another reviewer said just a bad off taste ,good price bad taste , good but not great
i think the hot cocoa taste great but my wife thinks it is watery my wife is a big swiss miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa not sure i will buy again because of the cost of paying for the k cups sometimes i think you are better off buying swiss miss packets and just use the hot water function on the k cup machine ,i like it but the cost , not as good as it is
unlike the other hot chocolate s this one does not have that after taste what a relief when i purchased my keurig it came with a box of hot chocolate k cups name not used to protect the guilty that have the most particularly unpleasant after taste all due to the fake sugar that seems to most if not all of the product br br this manufacturer does use some sucralose but no where near the amount that other uses in fact it actually tastes like hot chocolate during and after the sipping br br will be ordering more thank you for my kuerig hot chocolate ,if you are , not as good as it is
what a fun winter treat this is a perfect cup of cocoa in seconds we like to put a tablespoon or two of heavy whipping cream in the bottom of mug before brewing a family favorite ,winter delight , great taste
was skeptical about the quality of hot chocolate from a k cup but grove square is amazing it is just as good as making it from scratch but without the fuss the milk chocolate is mild the dark has enough bite to make it interesting and the peppermint is perfect for after dinner ,excellent hot , great hot chocolate
i love these the price is very good all the flavors are really good the peppermint one is my favorite and i would gladly take more of that before the others though the others are not lacking at all i am just a peppermint fan will be buying more when my others get low thanks so much ,great , great taste
i like this hot cocoa very much it has a very rich taste compared to the others i have tried just bought some more of these a href http www amazon com gp product b k q grove square single serve hot cocoa cups milk k cups for keurig brewers count a a cocoa ,grove square single serve hot cocoa for keurig , great hot chocolate
i was skeptical about buying this because all of the other hot cocoa items i have purchased for the keurig have been awful i was pleasantly pleased with this it is simply delicious i will definitely reorder ,delicious , great hot chocolate
this is a really great k cup cocoa i had been drinking the cafe express but they have really gone up lately so this is a good buy nice creamy chocolate flavor so i switched to this i found it at walmart but this price is better here for the pack give it a try ,really good , good coffee
for those who do not drink coffee this is a great compliment to the teas and also available for your keurig ,great tasting cocoa for your keurig , great coffee
super good price and the best k cup cocoa we have found br br i am glad i found this for our family before the big cocoa season hits br br love it ,great cocoa , great hot chocolate
i did not expect much from powdered cocoa in a cup but here is a tip put on oz setting then add a ratio of heated milk it tastes amazingly good br br of course if you add a little irish cream it tastes even better ,it is hot cocoa but add milk and it is decent , not as good as it is
we have bought several types brands of hot cocoa k cups these our definitely one of the best they have a great flavor and everyone in my house liked them even my year old who only likes some hot cocoa loved this it is creamy it actually tasted like a melted candy bar very good taste not watered down like some of them of course the price is amazing but do not let that fool you this is one of those products that is actually good even though it is not very expensive ,very yummy hot cocoa , great hot chocolate
make a good decision on a k cup hot chocolate and of course taste is something that is very subjective if you read all the reviews on every product you will discover that nothing gets past everyone and maintains a perfectly reputation so i decided that even with some bad reviews i would try this one since it has a lot of good reviews i am just going to say that there are some real hot chocolate writing reviews in this some discerning reviewers say it has a slight taste of sugar substitute or some such thing all i can tell you is i must have under taste buds because all i can taste is yummy hot chocolate my family burned through the first box and i just ordered two more if you do not like this i feel sorry for you better to have taste buds i guess enjoy ,yum , not bad but not great
when i got my keurig brewer last month i bought two different types of hot chocolate the grove square hot chocolate is far superior i have so far brewed it on oz and oz with good flavor at both sizes the flavor is rich and it leaves no residue in the bottom of the kcup the other brand does maybe i got a bad batch overall i will happily buy this one again ,excellent flavor , great hot chocolate

this is excellent hot chocolate for those of you that love love hot chocolate go for it you will love it to i would purchase this again ,smooth , great hot chocolate
all the available brands and flavors of hot cocoa for the keurig and this is the only one i keep buying more of when i run out of course it is not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk but i find it at least as tasty as any non k cup cocoa mix i have had it is richer than the same company milk chocolate cocoa which would however be my pick of k cup cocoas br br one star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the k cup which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum strength cocoa shaking the k cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some ,best k cup cocoa , a great cup of coffee
i love the flavor and the speed of this cocoa i drink one at night and each is the same good stuff ,yummy hot , great taste
i am very pleased with this selection i have not tried the other hot cocoa brands for keurig but this one is awesome i bought the milk chocolate ,the best tasting hot cocoa i have had , great hot chocolate
thought i would try these because it is a good price but the chocolate flavor is not that good and the sucralose taste is very strong i like the swiss miss hot chocolate ones better even though those have sucralose too you cannot really taste it ,gave it a try but not as good , not as good as it is
lets face it is not going to get you the most succulent chocolate in the world but it does give you a great everyday cocoa in a oz brew great to mix with a coffee for an instant mocha and no sugar needed kids will love it very happy with this purchase will keep this in my pantry always ,great cocoa for the price , great taste
i have searched for hot chocolate for my keurig but could not find any that were economical to purchase i found this at a decent price and was i glad my husband absolutely loves this hot chocolate and says it reminds him of his childhood try it you will like it ,i love this hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
my brother owns a keurig one cup coffee maker which is an amazing device i however do not drink coffee when i came across these hot cocoa k cups i took a chance they are incredibly good and it gives me a chance to share a hot drink with the coffee crowd without having to boil water or milk this pack is priced well against the coffee k cups as well ,hot chocolate in , good coffee
i have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink it has such a bad aftertaste that i checked the box to see if i ordered sugarfree by mistake i will toss this and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this dont buy this brand its awful ,awful , not as good as it is
we bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then cafe escapes dark chocolate it was also thinner in consistency will not buy again ,not as good as cafe , not as good as
i ordered this because so many people were saying that it was sugar free it is not the first ingredient is sugar it is too much of a pain to return so i will keep it and drink it because it is a pretty good k cup hot chocolate i will think twice about ordering it again though i would really like to get what i ordered ,this sugar free , not as good as it is
we bought this to replace our cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa they are less expensive but you get what you pay for this cocoa is watery brown sugar water with an aftertaste i do not recommend it a href http www amazon com gp product b k q t grove square hot cocoa cups dark single serve cup for keurig k cup brewers count a ,sweet , not as good as it is
i love hot chocolate and was very excited to find a variety pack however these are gross horrible after taste my kids dont even like them now i have boxes of the stuff that no one will drink very disapointed ,very disapointed , great hot chocolate
i was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my keurig and even happier there was a variety pack i read the reviews and even there were some negative ones i went with it anyways br i tried the milk chocolate it has such a weird taste to it but i gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night same weird aftertaste i asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds were not off he commented that it had a hot plastic y aftertaste to it not even worth drinking too bad i have more cups that will go to waste ,had much , not as good as it is
best k cup hot cocoa on the market bar none would not be without it in the house especially with the winter months coming ,great , great hot cocoa
as a hot chocolate lover i was disappointed when i tried this product i first had the peppermint disgusting and then tried the dark chocolate a little better the problem is that you can really taste the artifical sweetener i am a diet soda drinker so i do not have a problem with artifical sweetener it is just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste i definitely will not buy again i would not recommend these to anyone ,yuck sweetener , the best
i am an avid hot chocolate drinker and this is just does not measure up it reminds me of the sugar free swiss miss no matter what size you set your cup on it is just missing that cocoa flavor maybe the dark chocolate would be better i personally like the cafe escapes milk chocolate better br br i bought a pack and then i was able to find it at my local grocery store so i bought another one now i am stuck with the pack ,it is not the greatest , not as good as it is
this is a very mild hot cocoa perfect for those winter evenings or even good in the morning instead of coffee we love it anytime next time i will try the dark chocolate ,grove square hot cocoa cups , great hot cocoa
taste nothing like how cocoa should taste i will never touch this again i will be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck ,taste and smells like , not as good as
this is very good hot chocolate creamy and tasty all of the flavors are good my favorite is the peppermint i wish the peppermint was available on its own not in the variety pack my son and i also like to add peppermint flavored marshmallows for an extra shot of peppermint taste in my opinion better than the swiss miss k cups ,yummy , great hot chocolate
the hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it but as far as i could tell was not strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients if you have a very very palate perhaps you could taste it a little but it does not take away from the taste of the cocoa so as far as i am concerned it was not an issue i would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you would get in a coffee machine which is fine because i do not hate coffee machine cocoa i have only tried the peppermint so far and it tasted like peppermint what can i say that is what it is supposed to taste like ,nice tasting cocoa , not as good as it is
we enjoy a cup of hot chocolate with our keurig machine and used to have cafe escapes as our favorite when i saw the grove square brand at such a great price i thought i would give it a try we love it it is now our favorite brand i will be back for more ,love it , great hot cocoa
had never heard of this brand before however the price was right for ordering turns out the family likes this better than the swiss miss k cups we had been using will continue to buy will continue to use do not forget to buy the mini marshmallows at the store ,great product , good stuff
my husband said it tastes wonderful just like you would get in a restaurant creamy and flavorful recommends this product ,hot cocoa k cups , great taste
this has artificial sweetener just like the other hot chocolates out there if anyone knows of one that does not have it please let me know it definitely is not very strong but i handle it if it did not have the artificial sweetener aftertaste ,has sucralose , great taste
this hot chocolate is very good and flavorful compared to other hot chocolate that we have tried it is cheaper and we would recommend ,great hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
everyone has their own preferences i know i actually liked the flavor but my wife tried it and could not stand how sweet it was to each his her own i guess but now that i have had a second cup i tend to agree very sweet ,but too sweet , great taste
i bought this they were for the pack i could try them for cup other in the store were almost cup overall they are ok good but you need to run a hot water flush you each use or there is a potential to have the residue up you drain area ,ok product good for price , great product
this is a great assortment and price i only give it stars because the peppermint is very weak in peppermint so i add extract nice cocoa flavor to all tho reminds me of homemade ,very pleased , good but not great

there is a taste of sugar substitute the aftertaste turns me off i have even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste it didn t so i am just using swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig ,weird after taste sugar substitute , not as good as it is
if anyone knows of one that does not have it please let me know it definitely is not very strong but i handle it if it did not have the artificial sweetener aftertaste this has artificial sweetener just like the other hot chocolates out there ,away from artificial , not as good as it is
i enjoyed these k cups when i used them they tasted pretty good however i quickly noticed that my keurig brewer began to have problems after i started using these and other grove square k cups even when i would brew other cups i would get half brewed cups of coffee smaller cups and other issues i cleaned the brewer following all the instructions and tips in the the issues came up again as soon as i used these k cups what i discovered is that the grove square k cups were up my brewer badly i had to clean out every part of the brewer completely including the brewer basket area the water and the internal mechanism after the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal i will not order any grove square products again ,good taste bad product , great coffee
i am really by the great differences of opinion on this product i have tried a couple of different brands and the grove square was without doubt the best i recently purchased a cup of hot cocoa at a local joe in a local bam store that was over for the smallest size and really could not tell much difference obviously every person has different tastes and opinions but so many and star ratings for the exact same product oh well i like it br p s i like this cocoa well enough that i have subscribed to delivery with free shipping and reduced cost ,very good hot cocoa , good hot chocolate
this hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it although even the sugary taste is weak and by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose the consistency is watery and bland this is when i made the oz cup as directed by the directions on the box br br i do not recommend this product ,tastes like hot sugar water , not as good as it is
the price was as fantastic as the taste so convenient to make and no messy powder that is hard to dissolve no major cleanup to deal with either highly recommended ,great tasting , not as good as
the kids like cocoa perfect when you cannot make the kids hot choco tastes good too count not bad ,cannot , great taste
grove square hot chocolate is very tasty i was searching for the swiss miss brand and the search pulled up this one the price was right so i ordered some with expectations and was pleasantly surprised at grove squares wonderful chocolate creamy taste even on the large cup setting you will not be disapointed ,product my , great hot chocolate
i love a cup of hot choc in the cold winter months we live in and it gets quite here the hot is a little sweet for my taste but i have gotten used to it and enjoy a cup once in a while ,great for winter , great taste

i finally found a hot cocoa for the keurig that is not too sweet i made a cup the day it came in the mail and from the first sip i was hooked from now on this will be the only hot cocoa i drink ,thanks for the best hot cocoa , not as good as it is
my grandson and husband love to drinking this hot chocolate together i get it every other month i cannot ever be without it ,good for all , great hot chocolate
i thought the grove hot chocolate is to sweet it also has an off taste i would not recommend this to anybody ,hot chocolate , not as good as it is
in my trip through the health area of my local food market i stumbled upon enjoy life choco dark chocolate bar i just cannot resist trying things such as this into the cart it went it is rather good it says it is dairy nut and soy free and i will take their word the question is taste well it is a good tasting bar i have a couple others that i would regard higher but this one is quite good it is a bit high in calories per bar but has no cholesterol or sodium not bad i will pick it up again br br gary peterson ,no no sodium not very sweet good taste , not as good as it is
have been great both in terms of flavor and value i cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with in a href http www amazon com gp product b tj airtight drink maker pitcher jug set of two a and it works wonderfully those are great even better if you can still find them half price at costco br br i m glad i ordered this when i did the price has more than doubled i would still say it is a great value this is my go to tea when i want something with a little more flavor than regular black tea i do not sweeten my tea but i think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day the orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others it is noticeable without being pungent or artificial it also is not spiced like many other orange teas ,fantastic orange tea , good for me
arrived nicely packaged and sealed an aromatic lovely tea that i love to blend with others to make custom iced tea blends i love this oolong orange with fruity black teas recommended ,great tea , great tea
that is right open the bag and just get your nose close and smell it you know this is a quality product instantly some of the tastiest tea i have had and the oolong and orange are a great mix even if you are not a tea drinker at all once you smell this tea you will want to try it i am very glad i bought this product it is a favorite of mine ,smell it , great tea
i bought this to include in my daughter party bag it worked so well with the theme that we had unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale when i heard this the first time i thought no way cannot be but then someone else told me the same thing and then i heard it again from someone else really disappointing i am so embarrassed ,stale , not as good as it is
so fun and great price this was one of our party favors at my son birthday party huge hit i will buy again for the baseball team and group the box is just like the good ol days although i remember the prizes were better back then or maybe my expectations were lower since i was ,just like the good days , great product
arrives postage due in a used friendly box do not you think worst service ever totally aweful aweful aweful service ,cracker , not as good as it is
it was not a bad purchase at just through warehouse deals fulfilled by amazon and shipped for free but took stars off because it was not a freshness issue but cracker jacks just do not taste the same like when i was a kid back in the ,cracker pack of , not as good as it is
ordered this and most of the boxes were stale and stuck together br br checked the expiration date and it was not expired br br starting to think they just changed the expiration date and shipped everything that went bad ,very very stale , not as good as it is
we bought cases of these expire date was months out plenty of time to eat we have boys and got these for them as a snack in lunches etc i was worried that the product would be stale as stated in other reviews we have ate boxes and all were fine so far kids loved it and i did as well prizes were not as good as they used to be but they did not know the difference a few were and that never hurts we will probably order another couple cases at cents per snack you cannot go wrong ,no stale product here , good for you
bought these to give out as party favors for my son baseball themed birthday party they were a huge hit with both the adults and children ,great item , great taste
product was older then i would purchase if i knew what the date on the individual boxes was before purchase it gives me only one month to eat them all before being outdated ,cracker , great product
i do not know the deal is here but they are terrible i love cracker jacks and not just cause there is a especially now that the prizes are compared to what you use to get br br these arrived and the first box i ate seemed very stale checked the date and was not expired and the date was a long ways away so i figured maybe it was that box but i am a few boxes in now and they are all the same it is like chewing on cardboard i event went to the local to get some to compare and those at were better br br since it was so cheap to get them it is not worth the hassle to send them back so i think i will just give them out for halloween ,love cracker hate them from amazon , great taste
cracker jacks were horrible stale not crunchy and tasted awful even though the expiration date on the package had not expired ,cracker were stale , not as good as
i threw my son a baseball themed party for his st birthday what would baseball be without popcorn peanuts get item was delivered as promised the packaging was old school which was appreciated by parents the even great item was fresh taste great ,awesome packaged as , great popcorn
i ordered this product for a themed baby shower they went over well and they tasted just like normal cracker jacks loved that i could find the box and they fit perfect in favor bags ,was perfect , great product
i purchased cases of these for our company picnic the boxes were cute the idea of it all was a big hit but the gift inside was a i would gladly have paid more for a stupid little item rather than the on paper or whatever they were what is cracker jack without the gift inside i find it to be misleading that they call it original original had the gift inside ,you cannot the back , great product
if you plan to use these more then two months after you order them they expire quick i cannot use these i ordered them to use in my november wedding but they expire in march ,cracker , great product
if you are looking for a healthier alternative to peanut butter whatever reason this is a good choice it is nice and crunchy tastes better than other brands i have tried and does not separate as much as others best i have found so far ,very good compared to others , best ever
i love these noodles they are really great for a midnight snack it is not really something that will fill you up for a dinner if you do eat it for dinner you will be hungry later maybe some people wouldn t but it just does not stick to my ribs i love them though and amazon has a really good price ,great and good price , great taste
the ramen cup o noodle and some other brands i had been eating because i developed an allergy to shellfish and it seems that often these instant noodle packets bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish this one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do another plus for me is that it is not spicy i am kind of a with spicy foods plus i have reflux so believe me if i can eat it is not spicy just tasty br br one thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable in my town they only take and which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of oh well cannot have it all ,yum , great product
somehow i feel eating these things instead of peanuts i do not know why either also unlike peanuts i can limit my intake to a handful and not the whole bag ,better than , great product
i have tried all of these nuts and they are fantastic i highly recommend them as a snack which is not only healthy but tasty the combined with chocolate are amazing ,what a great of flavors , delicious
a delightful snack great to have around while i am working long hours in front of the computer ,yummy , great
i really liked this flavor as someone with many food sensitivities who also avoids sugar this is the perfect treat for me when i crave chocolate or baked goods the raw nuts are crisp and fresh tasting however the price was very high for the quantity of product with less than brazil nuts in the package i felt a little in future i will try making my own chocolate nut mix from bulk raw nuts berries and coco powder rather than spend per package for that price i would like a lot more product ,delicious but , not as good as it is
a great deal it arrived with no damage the taste to me is the best i have tried most other brands and really got fed up with them they just do not taste right to me but this one i can eat right out of the bottle and enjoy it it tastes so good i am very happy with this purchase and the price is great also ,the best , best ever
i prefer jerky with a dry texture but always have a hard time finding a good one they are usually soft chunks of meat instead of hard strips if you like old school jerky then i highly recommend this product delicious ,great jerky , great product
recommended to me by a friend i saw at the gym had seen them a few times at the in but didnt really pay attention i will never buy beans in the bag from the grocery store again huge difference in taste and quality sent my son who is an chef and gourmet foodie a box of beans in a bag as well ,outstanding , great product
they will tell you what works best for which dish br br some are just plain gorgeous to boot and being heirloom i believe you can also save some back to plant if you have the climate for growing them unfortunately i don t br br out of all the ones i have tried we like the best they cook up plump and will hold their shape with a creamy interior they are fantastic for mexican style beans whatever you like and i have also cooked them with ham garlic onions etc for a delightful bowl of beans br br this particular assortment does not have the beans but you could always add them to your order it is a nice sampler and will get you hooked on their products br br oh yeah sign up for their too out a good one with recipes and stories of the beans ,beans what fun , good but not great
i had no idea what this stuff was when it was served to me at a restaurant recently and i could not stop eating it finally figured out it was olive and i wondered where the heck can i get this stuff i am totally spoiled now well i for where i always go when i want the best of everything amazon com and there it was and now i can have it whenever i want i love tossing a bit with pasta particularly the tomato and basil pasta i also order from amazon it is great on salads on sandwiches and anything else you can think of once you get the taste in your mind it is br a href http www amazon com gp product b tm olive spread ounce pack of a ,that in your mouth , not as good as you
i got this for a gift for my father and he loved them i will probably get them again but only as a gift due to the cost of sausages ,really tasty , great product
i know the description is clear enough about apples cranberries but i found these sausages to be a little too sweet my guests agreed the same company makes sausages that i like better ,a little too sweet , not as good as it is
original description and order said assorted chocolates what i got weeks later was one pack of all white chocolates the least not worth the bother of returning even with prime might be better just buying at local store same or cheaper price when you can see what you get ,an , best popcorn ever
these look like typical sugar plum jellies but they are actually grape flavored you would assume that they would have a sugar plum flavor they taste like cheap kool aid and not the yummy jelly belly ones i cannot seem to find on amazon ,not what i ordered , not as good as it is
these arrived fresh and in a timely manner however flavor wise our family is in that jelly belly produces a richer plum flavor slightly larger sugar plum in size and a bit softer in texture for their sugar plums the price on the sugar plums is reasonable the flavor is good and it is always nice to support a small independent ,pretty good product , not as good as it is
this coffee is really rich perfect in the morning i ordered it for the office but it was going fast after a day or so i decided it was too good fine to share so i it out w some cheap stuff and brought it home more for me ,more for me , good coffee
this canned organic corn is great sweet and plump and being organic is added bonus inside the can lining looks just like eden bpa free cans but so far i cannot find the consumer service number of the company to if their can is bpa free at least i do not see the white plastic lining in these cans i am just hoping these are bpa free then these are totally awesome ,great sweet organic corn bpa not sure but looks like cans , not as good as it is
found this item quite good it was sweet and slightly crunchy all in all a delightful product it arrived in excellent condition no dents and no perhaps the packaging has improved ,a hit with me , not as good as it is
perhaps amazon should start a scratch and dent section and sell items like this corn there all but one can of this great tasting corn was dented severely dont get me wrong i will still buy dented goods but only at a discounted price the damage did not occur in transit either which me if they know they are selling dented cans fine but start a scratch and dent section ,out the , great product
very good corn product we will be eating this case of corn way faster than we expected it was well packed and stores in the pantry nicely ,yummy , great product
the fresh tasting libby organic corn no additives i cannot believe amazon can offer such good tasting corn in a can so cheap but for taste and value this cannot be beat ,organic corn , delicious
i combine this with libby organic black beans and libby organic green beans mixed with bob red mill organic brown rice at least two or three times per week for a perfect meal every time ,goes great with black beans and rice , great product
we live in an area that does not have a lot of stores that carry organic at reasonable prices that said i found the product to be a good value and convenient not to have to sometimes wait for local stores to restock if they even stocked br br yes some cans get dented in transit but it really was not a big problem for me i hope the future delivery is the same or better br br it is unknown if the can lining is bpa free i try to avoid it but until the manufactures get it out it is near impossible to buy canned goods that do not have bpa in the can lining pregnant women should avoid anything with bpa in it and if i had growing children i would also to avoid ,good value for me , not as good as it is
they decided to ship both my order in one huge box of cans instead of green beans in one box corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house then every single can of green beans was dented and cans of corn were dented ,dented cans , great product
i ordered from east coast supplier before and even when shipped with a bag of frozen water the dark chocolate coating turned very light i live on the west coast and this seller is in ca so i got the snickers in just a couple of days instead of br and their shipping costs were less they shipped via post for under instead of via ups br lowest price i have paid for this candy and best quality ,great service delicious candy , great taste
these tic tacs are great right up there with the orange flavor i did find them cheaper at the cent store cents a pack i went recently and bought for heads up for anyone living in ca ,great flavored , great taste
this was a very good price for bulk ordering however my order was part of some gift bags we were putting together for th there was never intent to these due to ordering i was unable to order all packs from here ,good price , great product
the best of all in the tictac line on my flight i was munching on the pack absent i with the idea of buying several packs then came the rude surprise grapefruit flavor is not a common sight on tictac stands anywhere br br i finally settled on this purchase as the only way to maintain a steady supply this flavor of tictac is best used as a chaser following a heavy duty breath freshening from tictac power mint the blue color not only is power mint effective it also out my tongue for several minutes a follow up with a single grapefruit my mouth to br br i rate grapefruit as the best flavor with watermelon and the new strawberry close seconds in general any flavor tictac is effective breath freshening but grapefruit is truly addicting tictac settles the issue that the tongue is a major to sour breath ,flavor but , the best ever
delicious and unique flavor great for those who like a little tart taste nice the have a pack since they are pretty hard to find ,unique and tart flavor delicious , great taste
look no always fresh nothing is worse than stale candy so save yourself from and purchase here today ,fresh product , great product
my daughter and i loved these when they first came out but had been unable to find them locally then i thought if anyone would have them amazon would br br so glad to find them it made a nice addition to her christmas stocking ,long find , great taste
we found these pink grapefruit tic tacs while in when we returned to california we could not find them i was happy to find them here they taste great ,to find tastes great , great taste
this is a keeper flavor hope tic tac pink grapefruit from the limited edition category citrus flavor seems especially potent to freshen your mouth after eating onion garlic ,forever , great taste
i rarely eat anything but whole wheat pasta but every once in a while i eat some of this as a treat almost as good as the pastas that i ate while in italy just make sure you do not over cook ,me of , delicious
i love the so i guess this review is more about how much i adore this store than it is about the salt which by the way is fabulous i got my order way faster than i expected which was nice i would recommend purchasing anything from these amazing folks and even better if you can visit their lovely store in this is one of the most stores that exists opening my box of truffle salt and smelling that fragrant scent was just not as magical as walking into their gorgeous store filled with flowers salt chocolate and wine it is a taste of heaven br br the salt great thanks people ,one of my most favorite on earth , great taste
the purchase and receipt of the box of chocolates was very good and made my home in plenty of time for christmas the box was opened the day after new years the were and dry the box had expired two months before i made the order i made a complaint with amazon which was resolved in a few days with full credit to my charge card this company wanted me to mail them back the chocolates which i had saved along with the wrapper they would not reply back to my inquiry as to who would pay for the shipping the chocolates back to the seller i still have the out of date and bad box of and will keep them for inspection for the next month or so then trash can ,out of date chocolate , great taste
a very soft very delicious brand cookie that is hard to find in the supermarket and generally around bag because it is never on sale i picked up my order of bags through warehouse deals fulfilled by amazon for a good bargain considering how much they are in a grocery store bag and hard to find usually in this variety if the sale is right i highly recommend it for you to try and buy for yourself ,soft batch chocolate chip cookies ounce pack of , delicious
it is hard to stay out of these wonderful cookies just the right amount of chocolate chips and the texture is melt in your mouth good ,cookies , great snack
i may be myself here a bit but i remember when the first soft batch cookies came out these were the first and they were bigger and yes even softer than these are now but at that time they were the only soft prepackaged cookie can you believe that besides they then came out with at least a dozen other varieties but for some reason they stopped making them i can remember every kid imaginable going nuts over these things so i am wondering why they stopped br br anyway back to today these cookies even though they are smaller are still quite excellent they are just so soft and taste better than other soft and chewy cookies this package made it about minutes in this house that is what happens when you are raising a bunch of boys br br great great stuff highly recommend ,awesome , good but not great
chewy chips ahoy and soft batch are very similar taste and texture i decided to try this since a had a coupon for off they are slightly smaller than chips ahoy but that is about it my cookies arrived a little crumbled due to shipping but no complaints because they were still edible and tasted great great cookies and now i have a of them ,chips soft batch , great chips
what more can i say barley edible crunch on sugar did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this because it did not sell or maybe bad batch does not make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth kids probably do not care hope this helps ,edible crunch on sugar , not as good as it is
needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store as stated in another review the jelly beans just come in an cardboard box this seemed a bit odd but there were sheets of wax paper i guess to prevent dust etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom not much else to say they are jelly belly at about half the cost of the local guy ,jelly belly are the best , good for you
i was shocked to see that the bulk version of these jelly belly are just in a cardboard box no plastic no nothing does not seem overly since i did not open the box for a few months the jelly belly were getting softer and to me because we live in a wet climate hmmm just be aware that the packaging should be upgraded ,a little surprised , not as good as it is

it is amazing how little popularity that diamond pet foods seems to have considering the quality ingredients their foods contain i worked at a pet store for about four years our number one recommendations on foods were natural balance and wellness two exceptional foods that are pretty expensive but for those owners who have multiple dogs or even one large breed dog those brands can your budget so when i would get customers who absolutely loved their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their i recommended diamond diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial brands like purina and iams but contains only natural healthy ingredients just remember the less garbage you feed your dog by products fillers the less your dog uses the bathroom and they stay fuller longer ,best dog food for the price , my dog loves these
fall out in spring not just normal shedding but actual from hair loss but this has that problem as well now our shepherd is a year and a half old and he is eating this large breed adult lamb rice flavor he is not a big eater but he loves this food will definitely keep him and all future pets on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now kudos diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food br br side note i would never buy regular diamond brand food if the bag does not say natural on it the standards they are kept to are way lower and the quality suffers immensely stick with natural it a couple dollars more at most and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life is not that what we all want ,fantastic dog food best price great quality , my dog loves it
i do not review much but i have been buying this brand for my irish for over years now he still loves it and it is good for him if you have a large breed dog this dog food will be a good choice for healthy food ,quality for a good price , my dog loves it
this food gets an a rating compared to for many others in the price range however it is about more here on amazon than at the local pet store after a sales tax ,quality food for less , great product
my year old great dane was itching a lot with the lamb meal from the big box stores i started buying this for cheaper and he stopped itching his coat is also looking shinier i wish i would have discovered this years ago it saves me trips to the pet store and money also ,perfect for a great , great product
i ordered two of these bags for my three dogs a a lab and a terrier they arrived well packaged inside cardboard boxes the dogs like the food their coats are shiny and the did not vomit when beginning this new food he has problems when switching foods but he started on the diamond naturals with no problems i am going to continue to buy this food for my dogs ,good food , my dog loves these
i have dogs with different needs and tastes and this is one of the few foods that meets them and basically one of the only ones i can afford br my oldest loves the lamb my husky loves the and the youngest less on this food which makes everyone happy br i always try to find food with good ingredients and this meets that standard while staying one of the cheapest foods i thoroughly recommend it ,dogs love it love it i love it , my dog loves it
this salad seasoning is so simple but extremely tasty it enhances the salad as it is not too over powering it is a salty mildly seasoned packet of goodness it is also very addictive probably due to the msg add olive oil and red wine vinegar mmmmmm i cannot believe i found it here b c you cannot find it in mainstream supermarkets nor ethnic markets anymore ,best salad seasoning , great taste
i have used this product for a few years now my family and i love how it adds flavor to our salads and frozen vegetable dishes problem was i could only get it at a few grocery stores when i would go home to florida to visit then i could not find it at those stores anymore i was happy to find it on amazon and ordered the case quantity which will last a long time ,good seasoning , great product
i this product i use it a lot on my salads vegetables and to season meats delicious ,delicious , great
use on my salads now i love the small packages i can easily take them to a restaurant i also love the fact that it is much lower in calories than regular salad dressing thankfully the area that i live in carried this product for a short time and i was able to try it unfortunately the area that i live in stopped carrying the product i know this because i searched every store in the town that i live in as well as the eventually i went to amazon and found the product unfortunately at that time they are out of stock i waited six months and finally amazon had the product again i ended up buying the pack of eight count boxes to make sure that i never ran out of the product again since i had so many i was able to share with friends and family ,perfect salad dressing , great product
this is a simple salad seasoning just add vinegar and oil one packet of goya br salad seasoning and you will have the best salad ever also you can put in br a potato salad and is marvelous also br please give it a try and enjoy it ,the best salad seasoning ever made , great product
my husband refuses to eat fish but he loves this it only takes minutes to make and is way better than any other kind of tuna i have tried br br besides the box itself you will need br br can of tuna oz or i use oz br tablespoon of butter br cup of milk br br it a breeze to prepare just do not leave it alone before you put the tuna and pasta in because of the milk it likes to boil over just keep an eye on it and reduce the heat right after it starts boiling ,organic simple and fast , not as good as it is
the box has only pasta and dried up sauce no tuna br br if you can see the words in the spoon on the bottom right of the box it says just add tuna br br so the products is making a false claim shame on you annie ,no false , not as good as it is
mackerel is a tasty alternative to salmon with nearly the same omega content my local grocery store has not been able to get mackerel for several months no one can explain why so i ordered a case of these and have been pleased with the quality and value i am reordering ,yum , great taste
the product was exactly as i expected and the same as previously bought in retail stores ,canned , great taste
at a can these are expensive for what they are but are well worth it the mackerel are of very high quality are well packed and not or smoked also since fish is the only meat i eat i end up having a can almost every day ,great , good but not great
these are better than the usual canned fish tastier and not dry there are no bones or skins i worried about mackerel but they are much nicer than say herring or sardines in oil it is easy to pour off the olive oil if that is a worry but you would be losing something that is also tasty ,tasty lunch or snack , good but not great
they taste good and give you a lot for what you pay the meat was of high quality i was however expecting each tin to contain one medium sized rather these are about small in a can much more like sardines are packaged but these are just was a bit disappointing for that and the info could have been more clear ,pretty good , not as good as it is
ordered cases on different dates and got them within days cant find these in the stores so please keep them in stock make for a great meal with some veggies or a salad and this type of fish with omega is good for you ,taste great and good for you , good
these are wonderful exactly like the originals only in miniature form delicious and crispy and the wonderful amaretto flavor rapid shipping from the seller as well ,just what i wanted , great snack
this has been a christmas favorite since my late sister in law introduced our family to these cookies over years ago she was from italy and loved these cookies as do we ,cookies , great snack
this product makes a great gift not only are the cookies delicious but the tin is attractive and of good quality highly recommended ,great gift , great snack
when i was in i got these for my as a gift he is from italy so i thought he would enjoy something from home although i was not sure if these were a little since a lot of the on the tin was in english anyway my loved them my mom thought they were too sweet but he just loved them and now i am glad i could find them online so i can get him more ,great gift , great product
we had that came in a box in france many years ago and have since looked for them in the states this year i searched the internet and la there were some products to try there were some products more expensive and because the product would be shipped we did not want to be spending a lot for something not that good these came in a can with syrup which was different than the ones we had had in france but they are excellent ,worth every , not as good as it is
the best way to get jelly belly a good price and you only get the flavor you want ,the best bean , great
instead of a resealable tub with the jelly beans i received a cardboard box with a plastic bag full of jelly beans they were closed with a twist tie and there was no labeling on the bag on the box there was a label that said green apple jelly belly oz new there was no ingredient list company logo allergen information or anything else you would expect to find on food packages i certainly would not eat food that arrived in a plastic bag with a twist tie i did ask that it be shipped next day so maybe they could not take the time to package it in the advertised tub amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund which was the only positive part of the experience ,very disappointed , not as good as it is
chocolate with coconut how can you lose br br i love chocolates you can really tell that they are made of top quality chocolate it is creamy and flavorful br br i enjoy these and i buy several flavors all have the same great quality and taste especially because i try to keep my sugar intake to a minimum i keep a supply of them in my refrigerator in airtight containers at all times they keep very nicely ,rich chocolate , great hot chocolate
very nice product it is not a bar but it helps satisfy the urge ,coconut bars , good
i wait for this cereal to go on sale before i buy it and the sale price is usually per ounce box the regular price is about br br for small boxes of less than one ounce each is cents per box nearly per ounce the sale price is cents per ounce the regular price is cents per ounce br br on the other hand this should make two rice treats with one box starbucks sells rice treats for as one of their lowest priced snacks ,ounce is more than twice the regular price , not as good as it is
de is a very good coffee i ordered this as my father in law raved about it and the whole bean aroma is indeed a good coffee it tastes like a medium coffee with a particular spice feel to it very unique and very tasty i tend to make my coffee very bold even if it is a medium coffee and even bold this is up there with some of my favorite coffees br br if you are a coffee fan this is worth a shot pun intended br br enjoy ,a very good brand , good coffee
i drank this coffee over years ago when i lived in the so glad that i can get it through amazon strong full bodied but easy on the tummy ,delicious , great coffee
if you have a coffee grinder this is the best coffee i would highly recommend it the taste and aroma remind me of sitting in a cafe in relaxing and watching the ,best coffee , great coffee
this is a very good medium roast medium bodied coffee brew it directly after grinding the bean to the most flavor ,nice medium brew , good coffee
this product came as advertized it was a great buy and i love the taste of the tea br br great deal and happy i purchase from them ,find , great tea
i bought this for day my father loves dried fruits and nuts br br it came in a somewhat cute crate box and each compartment was in a plastic bag that means that if you do not eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale as they are now sitting in the open same story for the fruit br br while all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard chewy br br i recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece but not if you actually want to eat it ,oh nuts , not as good as it is
i used this flour in my usual pizza recipe i noticed the difference with regular bread flour right away the dough was very and easy to work with the pizza ended up being lighter and crispier than usual i will only use his flour from now on ,best flour for pizza , great product
shipping was prompt and the product was what i fully expected it helped me be successful with mama lemon cake where u s flours failed ,wonderful product , great product
i do not know why this flour is not available in grocery stores in the typical grocer flours have a protein content much too high to give an authentic taste to such foods as pizza crust and homemade pastas and after years of making homemade pastas and trying to find that perfect recipe that would result in those served in the best italian restaurants in the us and europe i am happy to discover the secret was in the protein content all along what a fabulous difference this flour makes well too ,perfect for pizza and pasta , great product
so this stuff is a must have for making true pizza i am really thrilled that it is so accessible here in the usa this flour makes the most silky smooth dough i have ever had the pleasure of getting sticky with and it has a different better for pizza taste than the all purpose store brand flour sure it costs a little more it is coming from italy but given that you can make about pizzas per bag who is counting get this stuff some d o p tomatoes grow some basil and make some okay i admit have not done this one yet but given the first couple items there and you are well on your way to the origins of pizza in italy is it worth it i say and market always comes through for my home shipments cheers ,pizza flour , great product
i ordered this italian flour after reading an article about some of the issues with american wheat it is br light and everything i have made with it from cookies to pizza crust has been delicious it was shipped br very quickly ,lovely flour and not , good but not great
if you follow their recipes precisely with careful measurements the freezer jams are excellent strawberry jam is particularly appealing i have been warned that changing quantities of any ingredient will not have happy results ,recipe exactly , great product
sweet juicy and yummy i have to try hard not to eat too much at one time so addictive it tastes just like those in asian market actually this one tastes a bit better ,yummy , not as good as it is
dried mangoes are my hubby favorite fruit he especially loves the brand some come close but no we have searched high low to find a brand to these but there are none having them delivered on a regular basis is great with free shipping no more work and disappointment he does have to be careful however because he seems to eat them too fast runs out short of the next delivery maybe i will increase my quantity quality is the best delivery on a regular basis was a perfect gift for him i am very happy satisfied ,happy , great product
great value and much superior to what you find in stores makes a great snack or after dinner treat but for those who are health conscious remember to keep it to a few pieces since they are covered in thin sugar try to keep the bag tightly sealed once you open them since the slowly begin to dry up will be ordering more soon ,anytime , great taste
by the best dried mangoes i have purchased fresh and full of flavor the oz is probably the best value order a lot because it will be done before you know it trust me it is when you reach into the bag and only find mango crumbs ,the best on the market , best ever
i remember really loving to eat dried mangos when i was younger so i decided to give this brand a try these were not bad per se but they were a little too sweet for my taste i guess it is a good thing though since you do not want to eat a lot of them because the calories will build up unless you control your portions i will eat one and it would satisfy my sweet tooth for hours before i want to eat another one therefore i guess it is a good thing that it is a little too sweet but still i would have liked less sugar ,little too sweet , not as good as it is
this is not a oz bag it is only oz each bag misleading product thought i was buying oz bags not very happy should have gone local for dollars per bag ,not oz this is oz bag , not as good as it is
i love these delicious mangoes but the subscription option does not ship at correct times i just received two shipments at once even packaged in the same box this week when one of those shipments was supposed to be for april and i was not notified of that before they shipped and charged my card ,does not work well , delicious and healthy
tasty slightly different flavors then other brands but good in all other good purchase hard to find in us so i am not too picky ,delish , delicious
this sauce is excellent for authentic chinese dishes my wife is from china and we love to use this product to make hot pot and ma po tofu ,excellent for authentic dishes , great stuff
bought this as a joke to give to a friend that is a beer sp for his dog the dog did not really care one way or the other and tried to give some to my dog and he also turned up his nose not sure but it appears to have a very salty smell that could be the reason for the turned up noses however it was cute to put into pictures of the dogs with the plastic bottles looking like they were over along with their master ,cute item , my dog loves it
i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and his dogs it looked really cute in the package but left the dogs gassy they are a german shepard and a at fairly large sizes but it was a little rough on the tummy so use lightly ,cute idea , great product
i use this for iced tea and it is just so much better than american teas it just plain is it is all i buy and now i get it for others too look no further ,best tea , great tea
i am a big black tea drinker and have tried a lot of different brands out there and i find that pg makes the best black tea it is nice and strong not like crappy lipton black tea we have been loyal to the pg brand black tea for over a year now it is a little pricier than other brands but definitely worth it if you enjoy black tea ,awesome tea , great tea
i find it is difficult to find black tea in the united states that is of decent quality i love pg tips it brews up nice and rich and is reasonably priced ,great tea , great tea
i really love this tea and have found that my daughter and daughter in law feel the same i have used the loose leaf tea for years but find the convenience of the bags ,in the bags , great tea

love pg tips tea it is hard to find in the usa but a standard in the uk ,great product , great tea
i have to say that i really wanted to like these muffins but i could not they have a really bitter after taste whether this is to the gluten free nature of the product i do not know the hodgson mill blueberry muffin mix is a far better choice on a positive note they do raise very nicely but it is unfortunate that i find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left ,a bitter , good for you
i baked my first batch of these muffins and was pleased that they were so easy to make and tasted so good then i stored them in the refrigerator since gluten free home baked goods are for i ate one straight out of the frig and it was great i guess the flavors together after being stored a few hours i finished the batch one at a time out of the frig without re heating any of them they were so good that way i could not bring myself to try them any other way br br our family has been the area of gluten free eating for over years the choices just keep getting better as more companies are becoming aware of celiac disease i have created an through amazon that has the gluten free items we have had the pleasure of trying ,really good muffins , a little of the
i really wanted these to taste good but there is something in there that is very bitter i had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable no one would eat them they looked delicious after baking and they are healthy but that is only if you manage to choke one down i have tried their gingerbread corn muffin mix and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great ,oh so bitter tasting , not as good as it is
if people would read the ingredients they would be less critical of the end product i only tried them as pancakes and they themselves most i used an instead of sugar and they great and cooked very well i did not even use a blender to mix ,wonderful blend of and brown rice flour , great product
this item did not have the pleasant taste that most of hodgson mills products have such as the wild blueberry muffin mix however i found it greatly improved the flavor added nutrition if i grated an apple into the mix it increased the much needed moisture it was certainly a nutritious breakfast ,not the best of mill products , not as good as it is
a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely gluten free product it lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well as with many gluten free products new to the market you find yourself constantly adding something to try to make it right to these i had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to the very bitter taste i added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix this mix takes too much doctoring to be recommended at all until hodgson mill goes back to the board and fixes this but hodgson mill does have other good products try their blueberry muffin mix and hope that one day amazon will carry a of their gluten free offerings as many are very very good ,poor food , a great for gluten free
these came out smaller than i expected but the taste as not as good as i thought it should be second time i added a couple of items which helped a little but it is hard to find a great tasting boxed muffin mix i thought it would save me time but i like my own muffins better my husband thought they were okay but not great ,not as expected , not as good as it is
i could not get these to work for muffins so i decided to try the pancakes and was not disappointed they come out perfectly raised every time i like to make these without any sugar in the batter the flax makes it very bitter but i like them like that with lots of butter however if you just add some syrup on top it the bitter taste on contact give these a try ,love these for pancakes , great product
i have never prepared anything so disgusting the taste was a mix of sour milk and cardboard the smell just as bad i had to take the trash out because the whole room was beginning to smell i bake often so i know it is not a kitchen error and i am not that picky but i could not stop i would recommend pamela brownies add extra dark chocolate and they are delicious as brownie bite cookies side recipe on the bag i even make them super healthy and use c instead of oil ,i could not , good but not great
i bought these at my local grocery store i wish i would have read the review on here first the positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin the negative is they are so bitter i could barely finish my half i just recently found out i have celiac disease so i cant have gluten i have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so i can not compare it to any others i have tried the betty crocker gluten free brownie mix and that is wonderful so i do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there ,bitter and a disappointment , great for gluten free
reviewers that the aftertaste is somewhat bitter and compared to at least what i remember of real muffins with sugar gluten eggs butter and that other good stuff they are quite fine br br i do not eat gluten of sugar cane eggs soy dairy corn i could go on but you get the idea in order to use this mix i had to make substitutions and was delighted with what tastes like a treat to me aside from the fact that i do not have to measure out three kinds of flour to make something from scratch the best thing about these muffins is the texture texture is a challenge absent gluten sugar and eggs and i found this to be very much like how i remember muffins the bits of dried apple make these chewy and kind of so br br overall i am pleased with my purchase ,a from allergy baking from , a great product
i have children with food allergies so i have to use egg milk and butter substitutions for these muffins and it works well i add a little more sugar to the mix and top the muffins with a brown sugar and pecan mixture before i bake them all my kids love them you can top with just brown sugar if you cannot have or do not like pecans i love these muffins as well ,very good mix , great product
folks who are comparing this to hodgson blueberry muffin mix obviously do not require gluten free products since the blueberry are whole wheat muffins if like me you require gluten free this is a great product this is the first flavorful gf baked good i have stumbled upon very simple and quick to make like all gf products they are pretty dense in the end but the apples make for a nice addition and they fill you up personally i added a bit more sugar xylitol than the recipe calls for next batch i will also add some fresh apples and extra cinnamon my only complaint is that you get so little out of the box makes small muffins ,good and gluten free , gluten free bisquick
has a pretty strong bitter after taste and like another reviewer i had figured this mix would be sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener i dont like things very sweet at all but its def not as i re read the ingredients i realized there isnt any sugar sweetener in this mix so def need to add sweetening but overall i dont even plan on taking this mix that far im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away id strongly suggest avoiding this mix i hope the company works on this mix it has good elements to it i like the fact you can determine how sweet want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty and i think it could be really tasty ,so many mixed reviews , not bad but not as good as it is
if i could i would give it zero stars i am not a picky eater but this mix did not rise can you say puck was extremely bitter and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added save your money ,nasty , not as good as it is
these muffins were very good made according to the recipe on the box but when i changed the recipe a little by substituting almond milk for the milk and extra virgin olive oil for the butter they were great next time i am going to try adding some grated carrots and not adding the sugar thank you hodgson mill for a wonderful gluten free product ,great muffins , great for
i bought this because i have celiac disease and was really craving some muffins i am not a health nut i just cannot eat gluten with that said this is nasty it calls for very little sugar i figure for the health nuts so i simply added more sugar since it said to sweeten to taste even with extra sugar it leaves an extremely bitter taste in your mouth i would rather pass on muffins than ever taste something like this again on a positive note the muffins do stay together and look like muffins and if you try the product and dislike it you can mail in the bottom of the box and your purchase price for a refund ,simply nasty , not as good as it is
i concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste i also bake often and i am certain it was not me my gluten eating husband did not like them either they were also dense br if you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix you might be better off using pamela baking mix which is awesome and adding apples and cinnamon to it the muffin recipe is on the back of the pamela bag br in conclusion i do not recommend these they were really disappointing ,would be better to make something like this from , great product
and add a grated apple for that extra touch oh and i only added tbs of sugar and think they were really good as did everyone else who ate them i am sure that if you add even more sugar the slight aftertaste could disappear altogether br br i just went to the hodgson mills website and saw that they did recently change the formulation to this mix so maybe that improved the aftertaste this mix does not have garbanzo flour they use sorghum instead now i did not make these as muffins i found that one box is perfect for mini loaves which i prefer to muffins very good i will continue to make these when i need something fast and do not have time to make it from scratch br br oh and to the poster who asked about gluten free pasta makes a great brown rice pasta ,very good for a store bought mix , a
i recently discovered that i have sensitivities to dairy and wheat so i have been trying gluten free products i knew about hodgson mill because of their oat bran hot cereal which is really good and my tummy i ordered hodgson mill gluten free pancake and waffle mix as well as their apple cinnamon muffin mix both have proven delicious even my husband who is not gluten sensitive loves the pancakes i made waffles from the apple cinnamon mix this morning and they were really good and very filling not sure if the formulation has changed since the previous negative reviews but i have no complaints and i am very picky i just wish hodgson mill products were more readily available in our local stores if anyone has tried their gluten free pasta please post because lundberg rice pasta left a lot to be desired br br thanks ,yummy , gluten free bisquick
hot spicy mustard is oh so good i will buy another case when this gone makes a great gift as well ,great product , great hot chocolate
it is great i like it alot great price too i think it is delicious top quality product in my opinion ,hot spicy mustard , great taste
this is a nice mustard for sandwiches potato salad beef roast beef or hot dogs i have yet to find a single product that i do not like they are all tasty i am glad to see that their range has grown over the past ten years ,makes a great product , great taste
i started giving these to my daughter when she was months she loved them so much her first word was cracker while more they dissolve in her mouth so i do not have to worry about choking and they are healthy too i highly recommend it ,my daughter first was cracker , my dog loves these
we have to hide these boxes and pull them out when our one year old daughter will not eat anything else she will always eat these her brother and sister are always and eating them too ,a favorite , great for
my little girl will ask for these crackers day and night bought a pkg of and have used up real quick i will be back for more very soon ,all ever to eat , good for you
i love these graham sticks they dissolve well and are super yummy yes i have eaten quite a few of them i think they taste better than any other graham cracker i have tried and they are organic to boot as far as sugary snacks go they have pretty healthy ingredients i like pretty much everything i have tried from earth best for those of you interested in how they are sweetened they contain organic syrup organic evaporated can juice and organic honey they do not have anything scary in them like maltodextrin or other such sweeteners just vitamins and natural organic products ,crackers good enough for to eat too , great product
and they are good for them with whole wheat flower and no high fructose corn syrup like a lot of other crackers ,my baby and toddler love these , great taste
my year old loves these great snack i have tried to find these at my stores and cannot seem to get them very often love that they are organic and my one year old loves that is on the box ,great , great for
i love these snacks because they are whole grain and organic i also love the fact that they do not spill everywhere out of the snack cup like cheerios i have also noticed that they do not leave a lot of crumbs which makes mommy happy ,yummy and clean , great snack
i bought these for my because they are earths best and organic they like them but not as well as the cinnamon ones i tried them thought they tasted kind of like dirt ,organic honey , good for you
bought these for my and they love them i love them because they are organic only the best for my little guys my big guys even snack on them ,organic crackers , great for
grocery store first before committing to boxes through amazon which you are unable to return even unopened boxes since this is a food item the crackers smelled strange even before tasting them my year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few i wish i could describe the taste but it would be really hard it may sound strange for an organic food but it was almost like a faint chemical smell at best i can say that they were not anything like a regular graham cracker flavor even as an organic option they should have a better taste my year old did eat some of them without complaint so i am hoping she will tolerate them through boxes so i feel like i did not waste my money good price but definitely test one box first to see if you like them ,taste and smell were , not bad but not as good as it is
month old loves to eat them on the go they seem great for a healthy quick and easy snack ,great taste , great for
my daughter loves these snacks and so does everyone else i try to feed my daughter organic stuff and i am so glad that earth best makes a variety of snacks that she can have ,great snack , great for
this is a very good snack that i feel great about offering my month old she can easily pick up the small pieces and definitely enjoys the apple cinnamon taste my year old loves them as well i would definitely recommend these to anyone with small or larger kids ,great healthy snack , great taste
these are the only organic i can find for a reasonable price we love these and amazon makes them a perfect affordable snack for my toddlers ,perfect for little toddler hands , great for
these are great crackers my little guy likes them a lot and best of all they do not contain any soy or dairy ,little ones like them and no soy , great
i really did not notice on the package these are for kids more than adults nothing wrong with flavor but priced for kids that alot ,well , good
pure breed gsd and had problems for years with upset stomach eating grass and throwing up in the morning and then would not eat as her stomach was too upset it finally on me that due to throwing up in the am was that the food was not staying with her i even tried feeding her before going to bed at night and still did not work i tried evo and i could not believe the change she does not get us up at night to go outside she was having bowel movements every day and now she has or sometimes i have had her on the evo large bites for almost a year now and she has not been sick once it is the higher protein in this food that stays with her longer and has made all of our lives so much better thank you thank you evo ,omg what a life saver , great product
we have a golden retriever and had been feeding him the wellness dog food he ate it so we decided to find something else i read the ingredients on the evo red meat and was really impressed i at the price but decided cheaper dog food is not really a bargain if your dog will not eat it or get any enjoyment out of it the first time we fed it to him he pretty much inhaled it and will literally go sit by the bag and look at it like it might just open if he at it hard enough i agree with the first reviewer that loose stools are a factor but believe with time that will clear up he is just so happy that we will keep on buying it for him although i wish the price were a little more reasonable ,so worth it , my dog loves it
i have been feeding my gsd the red meat formula for about months and all i can say is wow before i started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food although the price for this food is a little it is worth the price you feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about weeks his skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too the only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stools but it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted all in all if you can afford to feed them evo its well worth the ,great food , my dog loves it
when i got my dog i did a lot of research regarding dog food and dog food ingredients there are high quality dog foods like this one out there but you probably will not find them in regular supermarkets while this food may be more expensive than other dog foods it is well worth it innova evo is one of the foods that were not affected by the recall also the ingredients are healthier and do not have high wheat grain content or nasty additives br br my used to have a lot of dandruff and had some skin problems also her poop was really mushy almost diarrhea when i finally switched her to innova evo red meat i would wished i would done it sooner she does not need to eat quite as much and her coat is beautiful no more dandruff problems and her skin is great ,best food for your best friend , my dog loves these
we have two great and it is very hard for us to keep the weight on them br br evo is the first dog food that both of them enjoys i enjoy not having to chase them down and make sure that they eat br br i have also notice that our older dane is more active since he has been eating evo we feed them a mixture of the innova evo red meat and innova evo large bite dry dog food ,happy , great product
a day with we use the large bites to help keep the and off of his teeth and to slow his eating due to the high quality of this food he can keep up his energy keep his weight up and recover more quickly from from running the field our vet exact words were your dog is an example of perfect health you may think the price on this food is high but it is worth it you get what you pay for also consider the canned version of this food it is a nice way to feed hydrate a dog after a long day hunting just give them an hour to settle down first on a side note we feed diamond naturals beef and rice in the off season we have no digestive issues transitioning from one to the other we switch over a period of a few weeks ,perfect for the dog , great product
complete protein based nutrition my dogs love this although i am not sure the actually tastes it she it so fast br br regarding the other users who have had diarrhea issues my picky gsd is that a word i think other gsd owners will understand has had this as well initially i this food thinking that he needed to be eating the same amount as he had been eating the other stuff br you feed much less of this product it is nutrient dense and not all filler like other foods if you over feed you increase the risk of unpleasant side effects br br it a bit pricey and i have not broken down the cost per day but since you feed less it might be competitive with other brands if someone was inclined to run the numbers ,excellent nutrition , great product
my wife switched our dogs to this food about months ago and she has virtually gone from daily to once a week the dogs hardly shed at all anymore no more brushing needed and their coats are very soft and shiny we have used other grain free foods previously and liked them but this one is definitely the best we have tried it is pricey but we are able to feed them of what we were using on the other foods and still maintain the same weight this food is well worth the price and the dogs love it ,no more , my dog loves it
this was a new food for my dog and he seems to have adjusted very well to this product thank you and i wish there were more coupons available for this item ,dog food , great product
my husband and i are not coffee drinkers but we love hot chocolate we hated the time it took to heat up the water and the mess the dry mix sometimes makes we saw that the keurig coffee maker did other things like hot chocolate and tea liked that it was almost instant hot water and bought one i ordered another brand of hot chocolate k cup and absolutely hated it it had a weird almost metallic taste that was not sweet or chocolately i was worried i wasted my money on a maker i would never use i decided to try another brand and purchased the cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa and we absolutely love it it is sweet and chocolately without being too bitter which is why i originally away from the dark chocolate i fully recommend this product ,delicious , not as good as it is
these cups are sweetened with sucralose i did not realize until i tried one and ended up with a little bit of a headache which made me check the ingredient list it is not noted on the front of the box they definitely have an artificial taste i would not buy them again ,artificial taste , not as good as it is
i am dieting and i use these as a treat to myself when i am craving chocolate i usually brew one of these one of my coffee k cups either plain or hazelnut br br for calories it is not a bad way to satisfy a chocolate craving when you are on a calorie budget ,diet treat , great taste
even my kids like this they are always asking for hot cocoa its not too sweet and very chocolaty it is not super high in sugar or calories so its a great little treat enjoy ,yummy dark chocolate , great taste
this hot cocoa is the tasting instant cocoa i have ever had i know it is not going to taste like the real thing but after just three cups i cannot bring myself to finishing the box i think i will just throw them out our k cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors we have tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa the first try was very watery so i thought the cup size needs to be reduced this results in just a sweeter cup of hot water stick with coffee ,awful , not as good as i have
these have an artificial sweetener aftertaste not pleasant i would not purchase them again this the first kcup hot chocolate i have tried i will keep looking ,aftertaste , not as good as it is
this product tastes like muddy water maybe because it is out of date i do not know but i will not buy this again ,taste like water maybe it is out of date , great product
good tasting and the pricing is pretty good it is always sold out on keurig com so i come here to make this purchase i love dark chocolate reason for stars the pricing is not great but it is okay ,another yummy , great taste
this is a wonderful dark chocolate flavor much deeper flavor than the milk chocolate the milk chocolate is good but does not have this deep flavor will be buying this again ,great product , great hot chocolate
the hot chocolate k cups do not work like the coffe k cups the coffee k cups have a screen inside the cup to keep the coffee grounds in the k cup it also makes the last drop of liquid to fall into your cup as much coffee as the first drip these cafe escape hot cocoa k cups do not have a screen the chocolate powder out of the k cup as fast as it can so that the last amount of water to come out of the keurig is mostly water and it sits on the top of your cup so stir it before drinking it otherwise all you taste is the sweetener also these k cups are made for oz serving size so use the appropriate cup size for your taste ,bad need to , great coffee
these were a little disappointing the hot chocolate is very watery and the flavor is a bit strange kind of plastic tasting have not been able to find a good brand of hot chocolate for keurig ,watery , not as good as it is
after trying several of these k cups we threw the rest of the box away it only ever created flavorless brown water we then tried the grove square dark chocolate cocoa k cups and were much happier ,try grove square instead , best hot chocolate i have ever had
this seems to be the best brand that i have tried others have been very weak in flavor but not one i would truly recommend this for moms who have small children and need the hot chocolate after playing in the snow grab the marshmellows and enjoy grandkids ,dark chocolate cocoa , great product
sure to be a hit with chalk a everywhere from first sip to last this product suggests its european deep in the chalk of southern france br br some seem to be making a case for it only having calories but the keurig chai latte only has and that product actually tastes pretty good br br i have yet to find a keurig compatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old swiss miss scooped from a tub or a foil packet and swiss miss is not that great to begin with although it sure is cheaper than this stuff br br i wonder if the size of the keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised ,sure the in , not as good as it is
this product is not sweet enough for me and tastes better with marshmellows already in the cup while brewing watery texture was a disappointment ,cafe dark hot cocoa , great taste
for this brew this chocolate comes in as a not so close second to some of the great hot chocolates we have had while traveling europe however this did save us but this is not at all bad for an instant cup of pleasure adding marshmallows or topping with whipped cream would take it over the top br br if you are one of the ones who wants to throw yours away please send my way i will get rid of them for you thanks br br i got this product directly from keurig as one of my two free when i registered my new brewer and purchased two could not beat that price here but at normal prices this is the deal br br from the package calories g fat g carbohydrate g fiber g sugar g protein ingredients sugar cocoa powder creamer and all of those ingredients etc ,absolutely delicious , good but not great
think i have found better instant ones i hate to write a bad review but if br you want to find a delicious cocoa mix in the k cups get the grove station brand br here on amazon they are always sold out which i know why now as they are a far better br tasting brand but if br you put your email on a wait list they will let you know when they come in and br you dont have to wait very long i would stock up though as you will find you want a cup br or two every night and the dark milk and peppermint combined box is the bomb i just br sent a couple boxes out to a friend of mine who was complaining about how bad the k cup hot br chocolates were she ll be thrilled to get my care package ,nasty watery drink , not bad
gross i tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes the flavor is all fake sweetener odd since sucralose is the last ingredient and no dark chocolate i am bummed because now i have a box of these cups and do not want to drink them ,yuck all sucralose flavor no chocolate , delicious
these bites are just enough for a snack they are delicious and the price is very reasonable i will definitely purchase from this company again ,really good product , great snack
i tried this brand first and i must admit i became spoiled because subsequently i went to whole foods to try and buy a bunch more i had to get navitas and found they were smaller drier and less flavorful so here i am this brand golden berries are large with a wonderful more succulent texture the only problem is sometimes i get the seeds stuck in my teeth they have tiny white seeds like raspberries but the berry itself resembles a large golden raisin the flavor is very strong and like a lemon with the tartness strength of a cranberry within days of golden berries into my diet i have noticed my are me golden berries are naturally very anti inflammatory they have an addicting flavor that i will gladly continue to feed into ,best i have ever had , great product
imagine if you made a out of a berry that tasted like a lemon instead of cranberry these are very tart which i love i eat whole lemons so tart is fine by me these are not super sweet either which is refreshing ,wow really good , not as good as
both my boys have autism and are on strict diets the foods by ener g are very good these cookies although rather crumbly are delicious br br my youngest son calls them white cookies i am a very picky eater but do enjoy eating a white cookie with him you should try them with some chocolate melted on them divine ,yummy , great snack
these cookies are delicious my ate a whole package the first time she tried them she has several food allergies and finding a delicious sweet treat is almost impossible i will be reordering soon because she has gone through the whole box already and has requested more i am so thankful to have found this product ,chocolate chip potato cookies , delicious
slightly crumbly but overall a very good cookie in my opinion very similar to chips ahoy but more airy less dense ,tasty cookies , good chips
like a lot of gluten free foods there is a to crumble but these arrived in very good condition the vanilla flavoring stands out very good for light snacking or dessert ,very good cookie , gluten free bisquick
son is gluten free but not fun and tasty free so these are great i put br his icecream on these for a cool snack taste good to him too just plain ,great cookie with these , great product
my husband eats gf and i don t and its so hard to find him goodies and always tempted to eat mine now he has some thing i am tempted to eat i thought they were ok cold but if heated up they really taste yummy ,cookies , good but not great
i am addicted to these cookies they taste much better than the regular ones the only draw back is that they should be available in smaller packages to avoid eating ,potato cookies , great snack
my son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies the taste is okay the texture is hard and weird even when short shelf life if you are buying in bulk not absolutely terrible but worse than average try pamela chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful or try a baking mix ,there are much better gluten and dairy free cookies , not as good as you are
i read the nine reviews that me and wondered how a product depending on a person taste could consistently receive five stars is something suspicious here br br nope here is the tenth five star rating in a row and i am tough this is the best sauce of its kind or any kind i have ever had and i am an old guy who is been around just the right sweetness just the right i would love to soak a chicken in it as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets br br these big bottles will not last and i will be back for more shure absolutely more than worth worth the little price this stuff should be standard in every home along with br br and my to those other reviewers for you ,what all these are right , best sauce ever
this stuff is good my mom gave me a bottle to go with some and we were hooked upon first dip the perfect blend between sweet and spicy this stuff is so yummy that even people who claim to dislike spicy or asian or any other kind of exotic fare find it delicious ,should serve this , good but not great
this goes down in my self condiment as a keeper i saw it in the asian market i go to for a huge bottle i looked at the ingredients no preservatives or added colors good good said it went with everything also good got it home and wow its amazing garlic hot sweet i am a fool now ,and hot , very good
and i do not mean just for asian sauces this is easily the best sauce ever i put it on everything it is gotten out of hand i go out of my way to see what else i can have it with my latest thing is pouring some over peanuts and coating the peanuts with the sauce then i eat the nuts with a spoon to keep my hands clean sounds gross but it is so delicious ,best sauce ever , best hot chocolate i have ever had
i use this in my kitchen for so many dishes it is a perfect blend of sweet and a pinch of heat if you toss chicken wings in it you will have some great bar food in your own home another idea combine sweet chili sauce heavy mayonnaise granulated garlic finely chopped ginger powder and splash of this will give you a delicious sweet chili perfect for burgers sandwiches fries fish or even chicken like i said it is good by itself but serves as a great base for other things from salad dressing to marinade buy this sauce in bulk as you will find using it on everything ,perfect , great product
i love this sauce sweet but hot too i use it on wings instead of buffalo sauce and with pan shrimp it is very and delicious ,great taste , great taste
this sauce is good but for my tastes it is not hot enough i have had other brands have a sleeper heat that makes the sauce multi layered this sauce seems to one layer ,thai chili sauce , best hot sauce ever
once in a while you just want a spicy different flavor sometimes when i have a lightly seasoned or plain piece of beef or chicken i put some sweet chili sauce on my rice wow that up the whole plate other times i cook the meat without seasoning and add what every flavor i am in the mood for when i it i have kept open bottles in my refrigerator for months without any problem br br if you have never tried this the sauce is thicker than heinz ketchup so you can slowly add sweetness and heat until its just right for you another way to use this is on steamed vegetables and you can add peanuts or sliced almonds just before serving ,for a taste treat substitute it for bbq sauce , best hot cocoa ever
the sauce was just fine however i cannot resist a particular piece of in the hope that someone might be able to convince amazon next time the sauce comes in a pack of but one bottle was broken you guessed it amazon sent me a new pack of two and asked me to return the unbroken original it is only cost me a little time but how much it is going to cost amazon to ship and process that returned bottle your guess is as good as mine is it really beyond the of possibility for someone to have split a pack and just sent me the one replacement bottle ,really nice sweet but with a bit of a , not as good as it is
a really great sauce but is slightly more expensive than in other stores it is great for egg rolls or a dipping sauce for many chinese foods it is also a great sauce to make chili thai sushi roll ,great sauce , great product

i love this stuff i put it over chicken and even steaks it is very sweet and just a bit spicy just a little goes a long way ,it over all , great taste
texture of the red chilli they tastes great but they have a very thin clear skin that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces not all just some i get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a that makes me feel a bit still i eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces i have ever tasted i would recommend anyone to try this sauce first and then try others if you are not fully satisfied this sauce is amazing it was about at the store for oz but if you like the of ordering online or cannot find it near you know that i would pay amazon price for it any day buy this sauce i do not care where or how just buy it you will fall in love ,highly addicting , best i have ever had
i was excited to try this sauce based on the reviews but it is nothing special for my taste it is way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough even my kids agree it reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish so if that sounds good to you go for it but if you are more interested in something more spicy hot and even a little sour you might want to keep looking ,just okay too sweet , not as good as it is
these are very large bottles it is a good dipping sauce with a sweet spicy flavor ,too much , great
i was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce for chicken and based on the reviews i took a chance well no one in the family likes this stuff it tastes nothing like sweet and sour sauce more like what it says it is chili sauce now i am stuck with two huge bottles sometimes reading the label is really all that matters ,i am in the , not as good as it is

i first drank this tea at lodge on the north of and bought a small packet up there i was hooked so after i had drunk the first bit i bought i wanted to get more of this tea asap was glad to see it for sale in such a high quantity here i used to be a coffee drinker but i much prefer tea specifically afternoon tea now and i just gave away a bag of coffee i will never drink i never quite got why british people are so into tea but whether this is a typical british tea or not i do not know i now see why they would build their afternoons around a high quality tea like this one sublime ,my favorite tea of all time , great tea

i went to check out and found out that the is on an canned not fresh produce ridiculous ,almost bought , great product
i received a box of this for christmas it is really good not overly strong like most black licorice it is indeed soft and it has a very simple ingredient list with no high fructose corn syrup like most candy br molasses br wheat flour br licorice extract br natural flavor oil ,real licorice , the best
this is the best licorice ever or at least the best i have ever had or can of the only problem is that now that my pack is gone it is hard to concentrate on my work as i go through panda and cannot think of anything but panda ,for more panda , delicious
this is real licorice it is soft has great taste and is very healthy love it ,real licorice , delicious
i have been eating panda licorice for a number of years and it is hard for someone who loves licorice to eat any other brand this is all natural which is what makes it taste great from the licorice root fresh always because of the unique packaging and the most flavorful ,all natural licorice cannot be , delicious
these chews are tasty and chewy the price is excellent for what you get we have plenty around for ourselves and to share with family great treat for little kids br plus they are good for you with no added junk just licorice br great buy great taste ,excellent tasty , great snack
this is what black licorice should taste like no artificial off flavor no nasty artificial black to coat your tongue and teeth wonderfully soft and chewy i took a box into work and everyone agreed that it was the best black licorice that they had ever tasted ,the best black licorice , the best licorice
my daughter and i were looking for some real licorice and after reading several reviews about different brands of licorice we ordered the panda licorice we are very happy with panda and will order again soon ,delicious licorice , delicious

this black licorice has great flavor and texture some are too soft and too sweet for me personal preference i am sure but i like this because it is slightly firm not hard but not soft and the sweetness is just right love that it is only ingredients molasses wheat flour licorice extract and oil price is good too compares to licorice which is my first choice but i cannot find it ,close to perfect , delicious

i myself do not care for licorice but my husband thinks this is the best licorice he has ever had and he loves the stuff i have also given it to two friends who are licorice lovers and they say it is delicious ,likes it , delicious
panda all natural soft licorice is a great snack for family movie time br we consume it like it was water it is the best snack next to popcorn ,panda all natural soft licorice , delicious

this is by far my favorite black licorice and the list of could not possibly be or better now if i could learn how to not eat the whole box in one sitting ,awesome licorice , best ever
if you deal with diabetes or please use real licorice products with care i ate some of this it was delicious and had to skip both my dinner shots i also in the night with a reading of too low for comfort so if you have insulin resistance please be aware that true licorice candies or extract may have an affect on your body btw i am buying more today to use i just will not eat so much in one day what a lovely way to get out of getting shots ,licorice , the best licorice i have ever had
quality and delicious licorice and this is the best price oz i could find for quality licorice anywhere highly recommended if you are into buying worth of candy you can subscribe for the lower price and then no problem ,i love this licorice , delicious
love it eating it has got to be a ritual taste is well balanced nice and chewy without being overly sticky leave a great lingering aftertaste br br compared to scottish dogs these taste and feel more traditional and much healthier too given that only four ingredients go into them br br out in the to be specific i found these in the candy aisle for around per resealable bag of g ,good licorice , great product
i got the licorice at a cheese shop in new york and by the time i got home it was all gone so got on the computer and found and bought some that is how much i liked it i have not done the before and do not regret buying it ,soft just the right of flavor , delicious
if you liked licorice as a child this is a dream come true it is soft and the taste rolls off the back of your tongue but you cannot eat just one box ,licorice lover , delicious
i love this licorice and as someone with a lot of food allergies i appreciate that it only has four ingredients ,i love this licorice , delicious
the panda black licorice is an excellent product the raspberry flavor tastes mostly like molasses this is fine if you value an all natural product but it is not what i expected the two flavors that i bought have all been consumed so they tasted good ,taste like , the best licorice i have ever had
in my opinion the candy from a freshly opened box is very soft and tends to stick in the teeth more than candy from a box which has been opened and closed for several days because it as air around the candy if i place it in an airtight container it remains soft but i really love it as the texture changes the flavor is consistently delicious and it is now my licorice of choice i was expecting the box to contain a plastic bag but it simply has a plastic seal along the top of the box with nothing inside to seal therefore if you want your licorice to remain fresh i would recommend placing it in an airtight container i have also purchased the raspberry flavor but have not tried that yet i have a hard time considering fruit flavored candies as licorice but enjoy the confection also ,does not my teeth black , the best
this is by far my favorite licorice to the point i have a case delivered on a regular monthly basis an option offered by amazon a very convenient service ,the best licorice , best ever

for those of you who like love black licorice i seriously recommend this product i eat it because i love black licorice and only recently found that what i have is now reported by as well these is evidence that black licorice is an aid to those with constipation it comes in other flavors too but the medicinal effects only come the black ,great taste and of value , delicious
i am a fan of black licorice panda black licorice is simply the best black licorice that i have ever eaten well done panda ,panda licorice , licorice
panda has good flavor but the texture and shape is not the best it does not have enough chew and i find it a bit dry br br i much prefer with it is big solid tubes and excellent natural licorice flavor and satisfying just right chew without being gummy ,ok but is much better , the best
not the best i have ever had but good the best i have had was expensive and from an english company i cannot remember the name but this is better than the movie kind they are not quite as moist and rich as the best ones i have tried ,decent licorice , not as good as it is
i have found a new licorice this one is ok but i really do not need the extra sodium in my body ,this is ok but , delicious
wimpy coffee drinkers beware this is not the bean for you br if you like strong bold flavor you have found it in what a great coffee br starbucks move over is in first place ,best bean ever , good coffee
i am not much of a candy eater but these suckers are fantastic sweet and long lasting my whole family is addicted to this great treat ,wonderful candy , not as good as it
the first can that i got of this wonderful oil was packed in a poor way an old reused box with not enough padding when i complained the company was quick to with an and a new can packed well for the mail i was impressed with their the oil itself was excellent a great treat ,good product , good but not great
beverage other than a snapple tea beverage that i would purchase again br br i m a little skeptical of the benefits of the micro nutrients that are added to this beverage l carnitine super and perhaps it is a bit more marketing hype rather than beneficial nonetheless i found this beverage to be refreshing tasty and something i would buy again br br it is a little bit pricey though compared to a pack of store brand diet soda which in my neck of the woods around or a little over ounce beverage is priced for ounce bottles or a little over ounce that makes it more than times as expensive as the store brand diet sodas br br in spite of the price i would buy this again and would justify the price by considering this more of a treat rather than a water substitute br br stars ,delicious alternative to soda , a
i do not drink a lot of sugary drinks and soft drinks i try to watch sugar intake and dislike overly sweet drinks by chance i tried one of the drinks and was amazed the drink is truly lightly sweet using natural fruit juices potassium and sucralose as sweeteners would definitely recommend to anyone who would like a soft drink replacement that still is not as sweet as a typical diet drink ,excellent soda alternative , not as good as it is
i have been looking for a nice strong rose tea and this is the one i have tried a number of brands but they were not enough for me this is an excellent tea with a strong rose flavor no bitterness nice and smooth i highly recommend this tea ,perfect , great tea
the aroma is amazing like a walk in my rose garden minus the bees but add a little honey in the tea and there you are beautiful taste is smooth full delicious ,the best of summer , great taste
i visited a in tuscany where they sold vinegar as well as all the wines the flavor of this balsamic is so difficult to describe but it is smooth i was used to grocery store balsamic vinegar and some specialty store balsamic it is like comparing skim milk yuk to cream which would you rather put in your gourmet dishes ,amazing flavor , not as good as it is
there are two types of larger suckers sold on amazon i got the tropical ones this time just as good as the regular kind these ones have a mixture of sour and sweeter parts well worth the money ,just as good as the others , good but not great
these mega are the best i eat a day so they go quickly i am not going to tell you how many ive bought since jan this year they are great i love them ,addicted love them get enough , great product
i am addicted to this candy will try not to order another batch for awhile this is my candy to eat on the ride home from work in to keep me calm ,addicted , great taste
although this coffee tastes fine there is nowhere enough coffee in the pod the cup that is brewed even with a smaller amount of water is weak and watery ,coffee pods , not as good as it is
the cafe blend is wonderful but it is too thick to fit correctly in the senseo machine the box advertises fit but it is not ,coffee pods , good coffee
coffee has a great flavor and is not too acidic fits perfectly in out juan valdez pod maker that was purchased at target several years ago so hard to find these so was glad to find them on amazon ,the , good coffee
smooth coffee but a bit to big for senseo all the other melitta one pod flavors fit just fine in senseo my fav are french and vanilla ,good but a bit big for senseo , not as good as i be
my husband did not care for this coffee at all he complained it lacked flavor and aroma ,not good , good coffee
we love melitta coffee pods makes a perfect cup of coffee every time the coffee is always delicious even the decaf blend if you have a coffee pod machine try all of their blends they re great ,best home coffee on the , great coffee
i love coffee and at night really miss out if i do not have the decaff ,good coffee , great coffee
i had bought a black and one cup coffee maker that used these pods it did not work properly but i have managed to use the pods with my old stand by coffee maker and am please with the flavor and convenience someone had commented about a problem with some of the pods being sealed in the outer packaging i have not encountered that problem overall i am pleased with this purchase ,good flavor , great coffee
some issues with the product some of the pods are not sealed properly so the grounds spill out either before use or after use into your coffee it is wasteful that each pod is individually sealed would rather they be packaged like the senseo pods the pods do not really fit my senseo coffee maker too fat for the single and too small for the double which causes problems sometimes when i brew a cup on the plus side price ,just ok , great coffee
melitta pods are full flavored however they do not fit my senseo coffee machine one pod in a two pod holder is too small and two pods are too large sure do wish senseo was still readily available in the super markets ,coffee pods , good coffee
my mom has the hamilton beach single cup coffee maker and was using senseo pods in it they were too strong bitter for her and i was searching for something else found these and wolfgang puck and decided to get both for her these melitta breakfast blend pods are her favorite she says they have a smooth taste and great flavor granted neither of us would ever be mistaken for a coffee judge by anyone i do not even drink coffee so my opinion means nothing but she really likes these and is happy to have them ,great coffee , great coffee
to make a decent cup of coffee i have to use two pods at a time i prefer a strong cup of coffee even if it is decaf br what happened to senseo decaf ,what happened to senseo decaf , not good
this was delicious coffee for a great price which i could not find at any store in my area or areas nearby ,coffee , great coffee
enjoying my java pods very much easy and fast medium strong to wake me up i get positive comments on the convenience of making coffee ,one pods , great coffee
this coffee a href http www amazon com gp product b m y melitta one one java pods breakfast blend coffee count pods pack of a is terrible cheap beans bad roast whatever my lot actually tastes like it is moldy maybe i just got a bad batch i have tried the dark roast melitta pods and they are drinkable even though i prefer medium roast coffees suggest you try one box of these not the box lot i am stuck with also to help you this response better you should know that i like quality roast aa or sumatra or columbian etc rich flavor type coffees i do not like folgers maxwell house type blends but even those are way better than this coffee ,not good at all , not as good as i have
melitta pods are an inexpensive alternative to k cups that also save in the amount of material you have to throw away buyer beware pods vary greatly in the amount of coffee they have in them these allow for a good size cup of coffee ,great alternative for k cup , good coffee
i have a melitta one one machine and have been using juan valdez pods in it when i ran out i searched for pods for it only came up with these melitta brand ones i figured that the others were not available purchased these very disappointing my coffee had been nice strong tasty but coffee made with these is weak tasteless i bought a box package of three different types am now stuck with them forget these head to juan valdez same price range unless you like weak coffee ,very weak coffee , not good
i have been using these for a couple of years now i highly recommend these if you only need cup of coffee ,one pods , great taste
this is one of the best decaf coffee i have ever had i was ordering this product from another website but found that amazon subscribe and safe plan is the most economical great product ,best decaf coffee i have tried , best coffee ever
a decent clean and simple cup of morning decaf i find pre the pod helps extract a little extra flavor ,decent , not good
cafe was not may favorite blend for breakfast coffee i prefer others of the melitta brand ,coffee blend , coffee
though london fruit and herb company blueberry bliss tea is one of the best teas i have ever had i cannot understand why amazon has not begun shipping it out to customers who ordered this item months ago it is now available through other vendors i e tea company in ma but not at the amazon price if is available to them it should be available to amazon or they should take it off their as an offering a href http www amazon com gp product b a g london fruit herb company blueberry bliss tea count pack of a ,in , great tea
i love peppermint but find hard candy just too strong these melt in your mouth and are not overwhelming and do not leave an aftertaste ,yummy soft , great taste
i can get it at walmart for each or the gas station for for why just why ,great drink horrible price , great product
we bought this to use with recipes for our this is an amazing spice and at an excellent price will buy from again ,amazing spice , great product
ras el hanout is a versatile spice blend that can be used for meats with a little oil and vinegar maybe some crushed garlic making stews or just mixed with olive oil and maybe a little crushed garlic for dipping bread you can find many recipes that use it with a google term like ras el hanout lamb recipe note that it is sometimes ras el so you can find even more using that br br i first found this at the famous and expensive spice market in this blend from is nearly as good note that there is no one recipe for this spice blend and there are many private recipes with a good deal of variation ,great spice blend , good coffee
i love the taste of this ras el hanout in my rice cooker for brown rice and quinoa it makes the meal so much more special large size too that will last awhile ,wonderful , great product
this is a nice complex spice blend that makes food but it can also very easily be used to give body to a quick i do not know what to fix for kind of dish it is a great emergency item to have in the cupboard ,nice spice , great coffee
this spice can be tricky to get good quality and this one arrived quick and the flavors are spot on use it to marinate fish or chicken then grill it love it ,great spice at a good price , great coffee
not sure it should be legal we put this and a few other spices i will not share here on some lamb chops and just fried them they were amazing this spice tastes pretty hot by itself which makes it a bit hard to figure out how a blend with it and other spices is going to turn out the end result was not hot at all since i like spicy i would usually have been disappointed but this was so good i did not even care seriously you have to try this i ordered two other spices at the same time neither of which will be getting a good review ,what this does for lamb , not as good as it is
cannot consider ourselves on north african or middle eastern cuisine or having enough experience with ras el hanout to say the aroma and taste is better than competitors but the product was extremely fresh and of exquisite smell and taste so am very pleased with the purchase will buy more when the time comes ,fresh and high quality , great product
i love these noodles they are really great for a midnight snack it is not really something that will fill you up for a dinner if you do eat it for dinner you will be hungry later maybe some people wouldn t but it just does not stick to my ribs i love them though and amazon has a really good price ,great and good price , great taste
the ramen cup o noodle and some other brands i had been eating because i developed an allergy to shellfish and it seems that often these instant noodle packets bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish this one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do another plus for me is that it is not spicy i am kind of a with spicy foods plus i have reflux so believe me if i can eat it is not spicy just tasty br br one thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable in my town they only take and which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of oh well cannot have it all ,yum , great product
i am by the glowing reviews that truffle oil is receiving on amazon those of you a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny bottles of truffle oil are made in a laboratory there is not a of actual truffle in them it is a shame that is despite being a few years ago in an new york times article called and a of truffles read it and br br and if you see truffle oil advertised on the menu somewhere you might ask if they are using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes ,oil well at least the oil is real , not as good as it is
a href http www amazon com gp product b black truffle oil from italy a br i highly recommend this product for the price the is exceptional it brings on a strong sense of ,awesome , great taste
never had before i drank a lot of goya when it was available locally tastes similar to goya though with less of a sour taste and slightly less carbonation br br i ordered bottles in order to get free shipping said bottles arrived in large boxes with each bottle individually packed none broke at the time of purchase this was the best deal going for either locally or in stores i ve never paid less than fifty cents anywhere br br now though the free shipping is gone unless seriously me to drop for shipping per bottle it is unlikely i will be buying anymore they should consider selling by the pack or case if they wish to the online business model br br so stars for value and the quality of packing with the caveat that i will not be buying any more until out how to sell it ,good , i love it
after reading that corn and of course pop corn was heavily sprayed with pesticides and uses lots of chemicals in the soil to grow it i decided enough was enough it was time to spend a little more and get organic supplier shipped quickly eden foods puts out a great product com certified organic and pops up nicely i use a brown lunch bag top folded down with of corn and sec in the microwave your microwave time may vary voila perfection add some splenda cinnamon cocoa powder mixture and yum yum mixture sticks really well if you spray popcorn with a little cooking spray only calories for no worries ,no , great product
it is not real crispy sticks to your teeth and lots of hulls br br i know homemade popcorn has a few more kernel hulls than your store bought microwave but it is a little too much for me i was really for this brand but it just did not work out i tried a couple of different methods popped using different temperatures and also tried different oils it was the same both times with no improvement it does not get better after it either nothing worked to improve it br br it does not taste old so i know it is not that i seal my popcorn kernels when i am not using them as well the flavor is really mild and it is definitely a good tasting popcorn it just does not turn out the way it should ,meh , best popcorn ever
it is very good popcorn but i used a machine so may not have been as yummy as if the oily stuff had been used although i did pour oil on afterwards why would i do that with an you ask because the was a gift i really cannot tell a whole lot of difference in the taste from orville r and this but what i have read is this is organic and much better for you but the price is well pricey no i do not intend to buy again for that reason but should my conscience me towards healthier choice popcorn again then i may change my mind ,yummy popcorn , not as good as it is
this really is the only choice when it comes to soy and dairy free baking unless you want to use lard the spectrum shortening uses palm kernel oil and has the consistancy of regular perhaps a little it seems to bake just fine and if you need to be soy and dairy free i highly recommend it ,the only soy and dairy free , great product
we have used this for all types of baking including cakes biscuits and cookies it works great and is every bit as good as buy organic ,works great better than for you , great product
this makes the best tortillas that is about all i use this for so it lasts me awhile br mine cost about the price as listed here but it was on sale where i bought it too ,great for , best ever
the mile chai is just wonderful the right balance of and spiciness i have tried some chai that are a bit too spicy but this one is very well balanced great with almond milk and bonus points for it being organic in as much as one can trust the organic label br br compare to peet chai i like the mile better as imo peet is a little too much on the spicy side although i do still like peet and some may prefer that flavor profile ,awesome , great product
a fabulous variety of hot sauces with a range of flavors and heat i bought it for a gift for my brother so i ended up sampling using them myself truly flavorful and hot i use it in my burritos nachos beans ,flavors , great taste
if you are used to dave insanity sauce or like me you are used to dave ultimate insanity sauce you are going to be really disappointed of the sauces are not spicy at all they are probably at a spiciness level below sauce i tried really hard to like them but i just cannot get over how watery and weak they are the only saving grace of the package is that it comes with a bottle of regular insanity sauce but as i mentioned above i prefer the ultimate insanity sauce i guess i have plenty of salad dressings ,not spicy enough , not as good as it is
i bought this gift pack and really enjoyed it the hot sauce in the pack is so darn hot it had me burning for about minutes and washing my mouth out with water for other than that one all the others were really good the wooden case does not hold the bottles well but the sauces were good i would buy it again ,good stuff , great stuff
this is a cool kit for gifts or a great price on a kit of dave sauce if you use it at home a good variety my only issue is that the bottles do not hold in the wood gift box very well at all they slide up and down until they fall out of the open in the front or back of the wooden gift box i would buy again ,great at a great price but the not so good , best popcorn ever
i am a casual sauce user and the taste of these sauces was just ok nothing special the insanity hot sauce was fun to try though i probably would not purchase again since they are pretty darn expensive ,are just ok , best ever
gave these as a gift to my brother we are both fans of hot sauces so i thought i would give this a try the wooden packaging looked nice and was sturdy enough that it could be used for storage transport of the sauces br my brother says that he liked the sauces he would not share with me on day so i never got a chance to try them ,great gift , great taste
this was a great selection of hot sauces with a good variety of flavor each of the different bottles had a unique taste and each of them had a heat around the same as tabasco sauce oh except for the dave insanity that will have you for the sweet release of death br br but the other sauces are very tasty and very usable in everyday cooking recommended ,great mix , great product
for the guy who love to up here is the perfect gift and he will love the wooden crate packaging great idea and perfect gift ,great gift idea , great product
my son loved all the sauces the only sauce that was way too hot was the insanity sauce use a tiny bit when using ,good hot stuff , great stuff
i have been searching for hot sauces and peppers to compliment my cuisine and i finally found it for those of you that do not like everything as hot as the insanity sauce their are others that are less intense in the for anyone wanting to use these sauces read the instructions on the bottles good job dave ,wow it is hot , great product
excellent customer service quick ship very well packed merchandise my new supplier of all things hot ,excellent selection of , great coffee
since i have had the insanity sauce before i decided to buy my dad this six pack for his birthday br br i tried all sauces but unfortunately i have to say that none of the other sauces even come close to the heat of the insanity sauce which is the main reason why i buy any hot sauce in the first place to feel the heat br br for any heat lovers out there if you were looking to buy this six pack i recommend that you buy six insanity sauce bottles instead you will be much happier if you do ,not all are , not as good as it is
since the factory burned down that made brand pickled sausage i have had to get by with the individually packaged version which does not remotely taste like the kind i grew up with not to mention they are half the size these are the best pickled sausages i have had since my last jar of a couple years ago i saw the crappy review and i had to show my support as a person who grew up on these things i definitely know what i am talking about if you want burn your mouth out hot then look elsewhere but if you want the best tasting pickled sausage on the market currently look no further ,awesome , best i have ever had
i have been searching for an acceptable alternative to the sausages for years and have eaten many mediocre and gross sausages this is the best substitute that i have found ,great , great product
everyone who has tried this that i know absolutely loves it there is not a lot of heat but for me that is fine the flavor is spot on and reminds me of the old fire crackers before they changed the recipe to dry sticks of meat probably made of kids i will definitely will be buying this again only is the stupid shipping costs ,perfect blend of spice and vinegar , great product
these eggs are soo good i think im addicted they are so yummy and i cant eat just one i was very satisfied with this product and it was shipped to me so quick said it would take a week only took days im very pleased and will always buy my goodies from this seller ,great product great customer service , great
these are the best beer sausages i ve come across in decades they taste just like the old time sausages i used to get in bars when i was younger if you wont take my word for it just ask of my friends ,the best , best hot chocolate ever
for a beer sausage that was hot to the taste that i use to enjoy back in the deep south when i was a kid growing up so far i have not been able to find the sausage that my bell these arrived quickly and they are tasty and i am glad that i did order these however they are not as good as the ones i use to eat when i was in my teens br br i gave the product a star rating because they were tasty but not what i was expecting i know many of you will enjoy these and you will probably rate these as a star item but i must be honest to provide the best rating possible the stars were for the lack of in taste they are not hot as one is led to believe hot makes you sweat these do not ,quick to and tasty , not bad but not great
these sausages have become difficult to find locally i was hesitant to purchase these online as they are in glass and are very heavy but when there is no other option so i ordered jars and they arrived quickly and were extremely well packed not everyone has a taste for the sausages so reviewing that is but the company is great to do business with and they do sell other foods ,great food company , great product
tried these the other day because of the low price and it from the moment the jar was opened these sausages tasted like card board soaked in beef flavored vinegar im used to eating pickled sausages that snap when you bite them guess i will stick to what i like ,mushy , great taste
the product was as hot sausage s the on jar say s hot sausage but they not even warm the sausage s do have flavor but just pickled we have been serving these type of products at our for year so i know what i am talking about ,red hot , great hot chocolate
while i gave it the benefit of the doubt was on the second bite that it tastes like vomit ,the worst candy ever , not as good as
this is good stuff and hard to find in the local pet stores here in pa one store carries it at times but runs out and at times i send for it through amazon com the price in the stores can be very expensive and the price through amazon is up in the air as the price fluctuates in the store and the shipping at amazon adds to the price i will not discuss price except to say if your dog likes it and is not allergic to it then you have to pay what it cost my dog has lots of allergies and is not allergic to this so i pay what i pay ,good product , my dog loves it
i was nervous after reading some of the reviews about the taste of this and or quality but after having been consuming this for a couple days i really do enjoy it initially i thought it would be gross but it really t it is nice with the fruit in it and has a kind of nutty taste great shipping great quality amazing and i def ,better than expected , great product
zen brews up to an golden amber liquor the aroma is sweet spearmint the blending of this tea is excellent spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor then you taste a hint of lemon the green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the impression of zesty spearmint and lemon into a substantial very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste br br remember that this tea does have caffeine however it does not say how much on the box a good might be mg compared to mg for the average cup of coffee make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter four minutes is ample ,and lemon are by green tea into a , not as good as i have
wow i have to admit these are really yummy i do not know how they did it but they do not have that imitation sugar taste at all they are small little bars slightly bigger than the normal hershey but for only calories a piece they are a perfect afternoon treat when you need something sweet at the office ,yummy , great taste
this candy is amazing great tasting chocolate and caramel and still sugar free i wish it was for sale locally but am happy i get a chance to purchase online ,fast delivery item as described , great product
hershey sugar free caramel filled chocolates are very good diabetic friendly chocolate candies these are fairly small but are very tasty br br sweetened with splenda these do not significantly impact my blood sugar levels or cause br br highly recommended br br cfh ,great candy highly recommended , great taste
if you cannot eat regular chocolate these are just wonderful yummy for diabetics and people who are choosing not to eat sugar plus fewer calories these are very tasty ,yummy smooth delicious , great snack
these chocolates are a welcome find they taste the same as regular chocolate but they do not spike my blood sugar i treat myself to a couple at a time when i have a sweet tooth it is great to be able to satisfy my craving without the extra sugar and fortunately the maltitol does not seem to bother my digestive system br br they re a little pricey but i found a great bulk deal at another online source ,delight , good but not great
i ordered this along with others i bought all together to get the free shipping over what really happened is that each item shipped from a different location and i was charged seperate shipping for each the shipping was such that i could buy these products more at the corner drug store i feel i was into and was left feeling ripped off by amazon this is the experience i shared with my friends after this purchase i bought books from walmart on line for the first time ,shipping , good but not great
it was shipped in a very nice package and i have no complain with the seller my plant growing bigger and now i am looking for a bigger pot to it is good if you are looking for a a plant that needs minimal maintenance this is the plant you might need ,like it a lot , good
cool i got it last weekend i was suprised about the pot size which was a lot bigger than the regular pots about the plant there is nothing to complain within a week there are already new leaves ,very nice plant , not as good as it is
awesome i was looking for this particular plant and walmart didnt have any i ordered it online a little reluctant my first even plant purchase online but it is doing great so far i am happy ,its still , great product

this roasted green tea was only so so to my taste i have found others i like better since i purchased this however it arrived in a box of twelve boxes each with or so tea bags way too much then i found that we cannot return food items so i now have a lot of tea ,tea was ok was big surprise , great tea
i use this coffee in my espresso maker and all i have to say it wow the espresso is smooth with a hint of chocolate and slightly bitter finish it is the perfect coffee bean for espresso for me i hate that strong bitter finish you get with some espresso beans like starbucks and you do not get that with this coffee i love it and will be ordering more ,wow that is some good espresso , great coffee
best coffee ever still have not found anything i like better i have never tasted coffee this strong that was not bitter at all kind of pricey when you start working out what it is costing you per pound but cheaper than buying directly from gevalia if this company started opening stores starbucks and their bitter brews would go bye bye ,smooth brown , great coffee
if i drank more than one cup in the morning i would probably need to back off the caffeine a notch or two but this espresso made in my stove top espresso maker is delicious and almost worth getting out of bed for ,love this coffee packs a in the morning , great product
a dark coffee that has no bitterness and is smooth as silk always use quality filtered water and a clean coffee maker if you want a great brew ,dark but smooth , great coffee
i am now on my last box of three of this gevalia espresso roast and have been impressed it does pack a punch like the other reviewer said one double shot latte of this made in my at pm keeps me up until a good am in the morning ,bit but really good , good but not great
i was given a pack of this coffee as a gift and it had been sitting around for quite a while over a year when i decided to try it it was without a doubt one of the best coffees that i have tasted very smooth and flavorful i would highly recommend this after that i ordered a supply from amazon they are vacuum packed i believe much better than store bought coffee i may try the decaf version of this to see how that tastes ,some of the best coffee i have had , good coffee but not the best
i love this coffee but i am not sure what has happened to the price lately i used to get this exact product on average for about dollars and the price has to i am hesitant to buy this product again for this price ,price keeps going up , great coffee
this coffee is splendid i cannot say much more perfect smoothness not at all bitter just the perfect dark coffee ,one of the best coffees i have ever had , good coffee
my husband loves this coffee i purchased it for him and i actually loved it i am a huge starbucks fan but this also does the job for me i would highly recommend this product ,one of the best coffees , great coffee
i bought this for my husband who has been drinking espresso all his life on a recent trip to italy we bought the lavazza espresso and i was able to find it and order it on amazon i bought the gevalia just to try something new and based on the reviews i thought it might be a good idea my husband loves it and actually prefers it to the lavazza i just bought another pack we use a stove top and this is fine for that type of maker highly recommend ,wow , not as good as it is
i have been ordering nuts over years now the quality is as good now as they were when i was given my first jar i gave these to my son in law the first christmas we spent together and when he opened them his comment was these are they really are the best nuts i have ever had enjoy ,best nuts ever , great product
cashews are most delicious cashews i have ever tasted and they are huge br they are not kidding when they call them jumbo they are so very flavorful br order these and you will not be disappointed br expect you will wish you had ordered a larger size ,best , delicious
these cashews were what i was hoping for they were large and very fresh they met my expectations i recommend for anyone looking to purchase these especially if they are a gift i was not disappointed ,great , good
with the grandkids you can turn a boring bottle of water into a flavorful kool aid drink by just adding a single packet to it just open the bottle pour in the contents of one packet then close and shake each packet contains both the kool aid mix and the amount of sugar that is needed for a single drink perfect size for a typical water bottle we use reusable bottles with them so we can fill them up with water when ever we need something to drink and then add the kool aid br br they taste just like when you mix a regular full sized pitcher of kool aid just in a single serving size these single servings work really well for us since we never drink a whole pitcher when me make one and end up pouring half of it out these were such a great idea ,perfect for , great product
however for the price and additional shipping cost if not receiving that free i would not say this is a such a good value not sure what makes the tuna more pricey than something like the freeze dried salmon if these were the only treats available to the cats they likely would not last even one week in this small amount in the future i would be more apt to open up a cent can of tuna which they are just as fine with ,the cat like , not as good as it is
the tea was a lot milder in flavor than i was expecting but still pleasant the aroma was light i probably would not buy this again but that is only because i would like a more intense flavor ,nice flavor too mild , great tea
i have fallen in love with this tea i am a british tea fanatic and has my tastes and expectations smooth not to bitter low tannins awesome taste i will take this over pg tips ,smooth rich blend , great tea
the packaging is so cute on all of teas and the tea is exceptional i would recommend this tea to anyone ,wonderful tea , great tea
if you have dry skin give this a try a doctor recommended i try this when i complained of itchy skin due to it is definitely more than the bar i used to use br br as someone already mentioned the packaging design is horrible i used to keep almost empty bottles upside down in my shower but then decided to use a pump bottle instead which i refill br br dove br if you are reading this please these bottles so that they are more user friendly in japan you sell liquid dove soap in pump bottles and you even sell refills packaged in plastic bag which are far more eco friendly and less expensive please consider doing the same for the north american market ,good for dry , not as good as it is
yeah i am a guy just because i am a guy does not mean i cannot want smooth hydrated skin i bought this stuff on a whim i love it the scent is light so as not to overpower and it does make you feel a little cooler as well as hydrated i am no longer dry and itchy after a shower i combined this stuff with a brush wow ,excellent , great product
i love the product but the bottle design is terrible in order to get the last or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down with the top that is impossible so you must stand in the shower the try to shake the remaining product the length of the bottle to squirt it out this takes much more time that you will want it to take the bottle with a flat top please ,great product , great product
i am a guy with arms and legs until i found this stuff i was using various other body with my i always felt like i could never get enough and that the application seemed rough and difficult to quickly spread the body wash all over since i started using this stuff for a few years now i have not looked back this stuff is nice and soft and can create a decent amount of with somewhat minimal amounts of application on the it goes on smooth and ends up making my skin nice and smooth and it off nice without leaving my skin rough it works well has a nice subtle smell and i will not use anything else ,i am a man i love this stuff , great product
i ordered personal items for the first time from amazon and i was very satisfied the product came shipped securely and the description of the product matched perfectly i will order again going forward amazon has not disappointed yet i love the dove body wash it smells very fresh and clean and really keeps the skin well i have combination skin ,on time product , great product
this was a great bargain worked out cheaper than if i had purchased them at a wholesale discount store plus it was for free shipment bonus ,great price , great product
my wife uses this and she has no it makes her smell nice and clean and it well great inside i personally do not care for it because it feels slimy on my skin after use i guess that is the working very good smell though ,great , great product
i just started using this product so i think it is too soon to rate however the order arrived very quickly ,pleased , great product
i had done my morning routine and i had to run something over there to her i told her that it must just be the body wash if you have ever used dove or it is almost the same smell br br i am looking forward to trying the cucumber green tea kind when i run out of these bottles i would totally recommend this for yourself or for any woman in your life aunt mother girlfriend wife i know many women who would never buy this dove product because they always choose their children and families over themselves ie buying themselves whatever is cheapest i intend on buying some of this for my mom and aunt to maybe put in a gift basket or care package for them br br i also use this as bubble bath when i take a nice hot bath excellent product a from me ,thick that easily i use it for bubble , great product
i love this body wash it leaves my skin feeling very soft it is not greasy either worth the extra money to buy the real stuff ,love love , great product
great product and great scheduled deliveries i get it for my youngest son who lives in a group home not sure what they do with it all but at least he is clean ,great product , great product
i bought this pack of dove deep wash and three months later i am still using it br i dont think i could use any other product ,great buy , great product
i love this body wash it smells nice works great and feels great on your skin add in the fact that with the subscribe and save deal it is a great value i am sold ,great product and value , great product
have read and heard that the ones you buy empty are for thin and what not br br if you use an old soap bottle clean it out first and fill with the dove soap and use in the shower if you can find a oz bottle maybe from one of hair out they are oz big enough to fit all of it and strong enough for thick products such as this oz the frustrating last bit at the bottom anything smaller store the remaining in a drawer in the corner upside down so you can squeeze the rest in the bottle without fighting with it too much by the time you get to that second half in the bottle it will be where you want it and you do not come out the shower looking like you got into a fight with a dove soap deep body wash bottle ,i have bought this before , i love it
both my husband and i use this body wash we both have dry skin and feels it does a really good job as a body wash it is a little pricey here basically comparable to store prices walmart supermarket i order for convenience one less item i have to waste time at a store getting with our busy lives it is needed so we tend to get many items from amazon mostly through the subscribe and save program ,good , great product
great for stocking up and keeping a few in the i like to buy things in bulk and this was a good deal and smells good too ,good price great for up , great product
i use this product every time i shower and it is great i usually get horribly dry skin in the winter but this along with dove lotion keeps my skin soft and smooth the smell is good not overwhelming and you get alot of product the bottle is huge very comparable to department store body i have and except a lot more affordable ,great smell , great product
needed the soap b weekend ordered on and paid the extra next day shipping even though i am prime because no delivery here on sat stuff came s promised on friday and in good package the price of the soap like lots of other stuff on amazon was higher than local stores so prices first amazon the lowest usually anymore ,fast delivery , good but not great
i will never understand the from mainstream and sometimes otherwise great brands who claim to have a line of sensitive skin products which still contain sodium or as in this case sulfate if you are someone who needs sensitive skin products there is a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without refer to their bar soap which is wonderful ,full , great product
this product gave me a horrible rash it contains both soybean oil and fragrance which are allergens they need to list allergens ,beware contains , not as good as
i do not enjoy giving products a bad review but i was so disappointed i had to i have tried quite a few teas and i have been able to drink teas that others say taste like dirty dish water so i can get down some pretty harsh teas i usually do not use any type of sweeteners either because i drink my tea right before bed i have tried to give this tea a chance ive tried it with sugar honey and lemon and the flavor with vanilla and a little milk to me this tea smells like dirty feet and probably tastes like them too i have also tried straight chamomile teas before too so i know it is not that i would rather eat the plant itself than drink this tea i have not tried any other twinings products so this review is strictly for this product ,just plain , not as good as i have
this tea is what it is supposed to be it is good the packaging was good and the tea is excellent ,great tea to stomach , great tea
i have been using for years the stuff is awesome i use it mostly when cooking fish but have recently started to put it in my family sandwiches we are also big fans of the guava and mango spreads highly recommend these products if you are looking for great taste without the preservatives ,huge fan , great product
i started using a href http www amazon com gp product b as gourmet sauce a on my grilled steaks and fell in love with it now i am putting it on my chicken vegetables pasta i am turning into a real addict ,it is the best , great
i absolutely love this product i use it on chicken beef and as veggie spread its also good in recipe for a little extra kick ,awesome sauce , great product
i was introduced to the blair chips by a friend i mostly ignore potato chips because i really do not like them however these i like the most among all the chips in the blair line they are savory and can be eaten rapidly the hot chips are good because they are so hot i cannot eat them fast i am so happy i cannot get them at local stores because i would eat them all the time ,it is good you have to order things , great chips
these cashews are the best i have ever had and the containers they come in are the perfect size ,great , great
and almost no protein add skim milk or you will get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk for added nutrition include a sliced banana and a of wheat br br if you like corn flakes that is your business and you should enjoy them but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than cents an ounce per package at this price the inner package failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish ounces of this stuff why not use a vacuum sealed container like wheat to preserve freshness after all it is in the same price range br br so if you are hungry you are really eating the wrong stuff something to eat if you are starving but please give real food to other hungry people please ,add milk banana wheat vitamin for a healthier choice , great product
it me to say i had to return this item the item page specifically said the were packed in olive oil however on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil an unhealthy oil that was the bad news the good news is amazon as usual was and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be not returnable that is why i buy everything online from amazon com they are the best ,in the wrong oil , not as good as it is
the content has been good the have been tasty the price was also very reasonable ,tasty good value , great taste
watch out for this because i wanted what was pictures however i got different colored flowers they use local vendors and it depends on what they have in stock the flowers still looked beautiful but i was expecting the white and pink flowers my wife got orange and one instead ,watch out , not as good as it is
at my local costco store i bought pace salsa numerous times the salsa tastes feel rich and i love the pace puts in the salsa spicy but not too the point where i am and cannot enjoy my salsa and chips br br the salsa does not feel watered down and this is a great go to salsa choice ,tasty spicy and rich salsa , delicious
i have a husband who could in pace salsa i wish amazon would put it on their subscribe and save program i ordered two bottles and during shipment one of the lids broke and salsa went everywhere amazon immediately gave me my money back i am surprised my husband did not eat the salsa soaked box for dinner ,we love salsa , good stuff
the sodium and sugar often corn syrup in tomato sauces is plus w them you eat white pasta to boot but w salsa you eat rice and beans trust me do not buy your sauces around your meals get salsa and plan meals around it br br they arrived in a day or two and the bottles were shiny and fresh i was afraid of warehouse dust and old stock the vendor did really well ,they go free or organic , best ever
these are really great tasting cookies i like the combination of peanut butter and chocolate a nice change from the usual chocolate chip cookies ,yummy tasting cookie , delicious
these arrived fresh and in very good shape just like buying from the local store only cheaper and delivered to my door ,great price , good
i was looking for snacks to buy in bulk for school lunches and this fit the bill perfectly it helped that my year old loves chips ahoy but for convenience alone this was a great purchase since i have free shipping through amazon prime ,great for , great for
the price is great the serving is just right for a snack and its a cookie buy a bunch and they send it to your house ,a no , great taste
these bags never close well so if you are a bag closer forget about it the taste you ask dry and with its own in form snack out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me negative comments via reviews and why oh why does everything have to be in order to appeal to and the type of people who have to their with stick figure ish stickers on the back of their vehicle please just go straight for the original chips ahoy in standard size out and forget about the kids for six minutes ,mini cookies with mini , great chips
these cookies are both yummy and well priced i recommend them other cookies i like are mrs fields packaged chips ahoy soft baked fig oreos and cookies ,one of my favorite cookies , great snack
this is not a gourmet chocolate chip cookie but is the best chocolate chip cookie that we have found in the grocery store it is not too firm or soft has a good amount of flavorful chocolate chips and makes for a nice snack or dessert we have eaten these for years in my house ,our favorite store chocolate chip cookie , delicious
it is a lot of cookies but the price is very good compared to the local grocery store the packages were in good shape and the cookies were fresh my order from january th has an expiration date of april th not bad but i would have preferred a later expiration date other than that no problems exactly the same chips ahoy you would buy in the store ,arrived fresh and in good , not as good as you are
delicious cookies i actually thought i was ordering the white chocolate chunk cookies not the chewy but definitely enjoyed these the only down side is these seem awfully small ,delicious though a bit on the small , delicious
exactly what i wanted individual packages of cookies that i could not find at a store shipping was only cents and came to be in about days br br it was great ,great as a baby party , delicious
i really like the crunchy chocolate chip cookies the soft ones are chemically and i think gross these have good flavor and are great for trips although eating anything crunchy in the car is wait for a rest stop and especially for snacks ,good store bought cookies , good
i have a bit of a sweet tooth i have tried to ignore it in times past but the reality is that i want need a cookie from time to time as a welcome addition to my brown bag lunch these ounce single servings make that easy without it if i bring one with me i know i will only end up eating one package and not half of a ounce package single servings help keep the portion size healthy while not killing your soul by your need for some desert br br reasonably priced and shipped to your door these are a great purchase ,great snack , not as good as i be
i did not know that i was ordering biscuit crumbs that is exactly what i received such a lousy product it is amazon fault for shipping out products will never order food from amazon com ever ,new amazon com , not as good as it is
i meant to pick up the normal chewy chips ahoy and was when i returned home to find that they the word oatmeal in the corner of the package but kept everything else the same i decided to try them anyway and the oats definitely the normally wonderful chemistry between the chocolate and dough br ,misleading packaging , great chips
chips ahoy chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces my tastebuds say they are too sweet not cooked enough lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes if you like cookie dough you most likely will enjoy these i will stick with a crunchy less sweet cookie ,with the , great chips
and gives the cookie sort of a coconut type consistency now let us also remember that tastes differ so i have given my opinion br br then these are soft chewy cookies as advertised they are not crispy cookies or the would say crispy rather than chewy i happen to like raw cookie dough however i do not see where these taste like raw cookie dough both are soft however so is this the and yes they stick together soft cookies tend to do that they are not individually wrapped which would add to the cost oh yeah chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet br br so if you want something hard and crisp i suggest ginger snaps if you want a cookie that is soft chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal give these a try i am here to place my second order ,are we our or these cookies , good but not as good as i like
when i eat junk food i would like to enjoy it the guilty pleasure it is br br these cookies are neither healthy or tasty stick to chewy chocolate chip cookies ,cookies , great cookies
i purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies wrong i like chocolate chip and i like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just do not work well together i wish i had read the item listing more carefully even my kids said blech ,bad flavor , good but not great
after eating tang chocolate and double chocolate cookies all other cookies will taste like expired dogfood to you her cookies will enhance your life in ways you never possible tim timothy second cup starbucks treats and those horrid packaged cookies at are just to the that is a tang cookie her cookies are da bomb a damn ,cookie compared to , delicious
overall i was not happy with the of these cookies they were way to fragile and there is just too many crumbs in my bed how am i supposed to sleep like this ,do not eat these cookies in bed , good but not great
sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank i like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are and high in omega fats the skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion regular sardines taste a bit too oily fishy and strong to me they are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile i sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling mix with egg oatmeal onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty or add them to a salad although i think these from roland are very good i liked the seasons skinless sardines which are also sold by amazon even better for flavor and texture ,healthy tasty convenient and not too expensive , not as good as i be
this is a very tasty product tastes more like tuna however i believe the mg of salt listed on the for a cup serving is much lower than the actual salt content i use very little salt and these are somewhat salty i also opened a can of crown prince natural sardines in water which has a salt content of about mg the crown prince tasted much less salty than the roland sardines so i think roland needs to be a little more careful about their packaging and list of ingredients my guess is the salt content is comparable to a can of water packed tuna maybe mg or higher per cup serving ,not really low sodium a lot more salt than , delicious
skinless sardines in water differ from the ones with skin in oil in that they are somewhat coarse and dense as opposed to the softer texture of sardines in oil not much fishy odor and the liquid is flavorful ,sardines in water , the best
i like this product much better than the canned sardines i am able to find at my local grocery stores i buy and seasons both sold by amazon and in my opinion they are superior in both taste and texture it is a toss up for me as to and boneless opposed to the skin on with bones i like both there are more nutrients in the ones with bones which along with the omega s is the plus factor for sardines they work for me i have eaten them since i was a kid i will turn in july incidentally my cat is crazy about them too ,amazon sardines good for low sodium , great cat food
be tough to choose another why many other brands charge the same price as or more than roland with only a oz tin whereas roland includes more fish in the tin the quality is consistent and the sardines themselves are quite succulent and versatile enough to be included in stir fries salads pasta dishes etc without overpowering the other flavors br br oddly enough i was half mindful when a semi local dollar store which is for carrying a ton of food items in my city i was looking to make some lower cost and healthier choices in my diet at the time not expecting to find these of course but rather turning my nose up at the usual i saw stocked there when i accidentally stumbled across them at per tin it was a huge buy so i tried a few the rest as they say is history as ,an excellent item for an excellent price , great product
just had my st can of these sardines and i am delighted big sardines in the can with a most excellent mild flavor made a tuna salad but used sardines wonderful i have to say that i really did not notice that they were low sodium as far as the overall sardine taste love the ones without oil as i do not really like that greasy fish taste you get with some sardines i just got diagnosed with and i read that sardines are good to help your function i will be ordering more of these ,most excellent sardines , great product
roland s b sardines are the best you can buy and believe me i have tried them all also amazon price is half what i had been paying ,the best , great product
after the doc said cut the salt and tuna is expensive and with no sodium and of little health benefit i have been looking for br no salt tasteless food i will be a br i took this product added some lemon juice and sprayed on some liquid smoke from an bottle i for the occasion it up and it tastes great on a br i can even extend it a little bit by adding some shredded lettuce to the mix and it is my fave breakfast br low sodium means getting creative br mustard balsamic vinegar lemon juice sauce and liquid smoke have been for replacing salt though none comes close br if you have another salt replacement ingredient to add please put a reply here br thanks ,low sodium still food , not as good as i be
water based sardines without salt is not bad of a product here far superior to the types i normally purchase at stores ,water low sodium sardines that actually taste good , the best
i love canned sardines and when they put me on a low salt diet br i figured that was the end of my sardines until i found these they taste fantastic the price is reasonable and you can at least have br something that before these sardines was not available to people br on a low salt diet side benefits as they are skinless and boneless br thanks to the co ,sardines , great taste
these are really good the sodium is ok based upon the daily allowance it is a great fast meal when you do not want to cut on the stove and it is really good when added to a salad so far the low fat sardines has aided me in my weight loss i am going to continue roland product until i reach my final goal weight they taste good a coarse and dry but i normally add the juice to a fork full i love them i learned not to be too critical and enjoy the little things in life ,perfect diet , good but not great
i have eaten a lot of sardines in my life and by far these are the best the extra cost of boneless skinless is worth it there is more to eat and less waste love the water packed instead of the of oil excellent ,the best , best ever
just water and large pieces of sardines open for all types of combinations of which i find the old whole grain crackers quality cheese a of mayo and mustard and a hot cup of tea the most appealing they do lunch in a hurry and snack times as well solid product even drank the water in which they are laid to rest and not too sardines are good for a person everyone agrees on that even a sardine sandwich sounds about right in the next few minutes the better the bread the better the sandwich so yes solid stars and i am hungry for the product right now come to think of it ,i like these , not as good as i be
the product arrived on time and is delicious thanks very much the price was very fair what else needs to be said ,customer , good flavor
i buy skinless sardines packed in water to keep my intake of sodium and down for about a can including tax and delivery i feel i am getting my money worth i cannot get these kinds of sardines at the local supermarket br br sardines are somewhat tasteless i put the sardines on salad and top the salad with olive oil and red wine vinegar if i eat the sardines as a sandwich i used mustard which also has no salt and ,sardines are healthy and good , great product
i have had to change my diet and now have better health these are very tasty ,good products for low sodium diets available from amazon , great product
i have tried many brands of sardines these are my favorite even with low sodium they are full of flavor excellent choice ,good choice , delicious
these are the best skinless boneless sardines that i have tried and they are very reasonably priced they remind me a little more of tuna fish than sardines but in a mild rather than bad way and are very firm for water packed fish i especially like these mixed with salsa they work out to can or oz if you choose the longer but free shipping ,mild and inexpensive , great product
i am on a very low sodium intake per day and these are great good taste and low sodium i just put a little mustard on them and yum ,great taste low sodium , great taste
this is a favorite chocolate bar of several family members made so by a visit to germany hard to find in the states glad to know where to get them ,chocolate bar , great taste
yum i could live off of this stuff the peach flavor is refreshing and delicious it is no longer sold where i live and i really miss it can t even get it from amazon it is just too good to be discontinued ,the best soda ever , great taste
i usually find the citrus sodas too tart acidic for my tastes and i find the black cherry fresca too sweet i love the peach it is so crisp and refreshing without being acidic and is just the right sweet for me other than ginger ale it is my favorite white soda i have been having trouble finding this in the grocery and really hope it has not been discontinued ,crisp refreshing but not too tart , great taste
i was looking for a low calorie cocktail and mixed a rose wine with the fresca peach and it was delicious and i am not a soda drinker and do not normally drink rose wine make sure to get a rose that is not sweet or you might as well drink kool aid look for off dry or bone dry rose maybe made with a tend to be too sweet for my taste but you might like it a sparkling rose would be great too you can serve this with ice in a cocktail glass or without ice in a martini glass ,low calorie idea , not as good as it is
this is an excellent product id does what it says it will bring shine and health to your pets coat and the dogs love it ,excellent , great product
is not just for me i also grow this in trays for my cats who live indoors deprived of valuable natural all need it and we are now enjoying a strong healthy grown variety which is easy to grow and lasts a long time wheat grass has larger blades than lawn grass which does not the cats to being sick they crave it and are very healthy with glossy soft coats their energy levels are better and they are playing more both are perfectly healthy is kind of like eating liquid mixed in with it does a body good if you care about your or other bodies then get this very nice product the shipping is fast and it is packaged well the cans are sealed well with a tight lid yes i am going to continue ordering from this vendor again they have exactly what i am looking for ,packaged red wheat seeds , cats love these
body forgot what those strong bbq flavored chips were like and i started craving soy crisps i began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars which i had completely missed before apparently because it was not a sweet red overbearing bbq powder i the next bags off in three days br br now i am ordering here on amazon cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to my for trying to eat healthy food my advice is this give these soy crisps a chance but do not mix them in with your regular doritos and bbq ruffles or you will think they are awful stop eating for a month the oily bbq chips that have your taste buds for years and your taste buds with these healthier chips you will feel better about snacking ,your snack , great chips
i found out about these from a co worker they are delicious low calorie and pack some protein eating these rather than my usual pretzels and chips helped me slim down i get them by the case now from amazon since it is a better buy and my supermarket does not always carry them ,fantastic taste and good for you , great taste
for people watching weight or nutrition these chips are an excellent substitute for regular chips they have plenty of protein as well br amazon price is much cheaper than buying packs at the local grocery store ,save money , great chips
i love light crispy salty snacks and soy crisps is the best one of those i have found at only calories per serving calories for the bag you could literally eat the entire bag which i do on a regular basis and not feel bad about it br br there are several flavors but deep sea salt is my favorite because it is subtle and just enhances the natural flavor of the rice and soy br br so delish shipped fast with all crisps in tact great purchase re ordering ,i love soy crisps , delicious and delicious
these are one of my favorite ways to eat grains plus they are a good source of protein chips per serving is just about right i wish they had a little less salt but for the calorie fat fiber content they are pretty healthy great with soup or salads or just plain i would definitely recommend these ,one of my favorites , great taste
just the same thing i use to buy in the stores but for less same great taste same great package same because it is the exact same thing love is stuff thanks ,soy crisp , great product
i am a huge fan of genisoy soy crisps deep sea salted flavor br i love the crunch and texture of this non greasy snack the flavor is subtle and very light no heavy salty taste or greasy lips or fingers after eating i also like that i can really indulge on these and not feel the regret of eating too many calories soy crisps are my fav crunchy treat lt ,crunchy no guilt snack , good but not great
i love this flavor of soy crisps deep sea salted however they are not available in the smaller individual size like most of the other flavors are my husband prefers the lightly salted ones because they are crispier that the sea salted ones he is right but i do like this softer crunch too it sort of reminds me of popcorn in fact i do not mind the big bag on occasions for example if it is a replacement for a big bag of popcorn while watching a movie what a nice healthy treat ,delicious but packaging could be smaller , great taste
i am a big fan of the carbs fat and protein balance of these crisps the salt is not overpowering and the taste is ok i have had better soy chips genisoy tortilla chips but these are alright if you do not like the crunch of a chip ,pretty good , good chips
stores are not carrying this product thank goodness i can still get them a href http www amazon com gp product b genisoy soy crisps deep sea salted ounce bags pack of a ,too good to be healthy , good for you
i love these soy crisps they are the perfect salty crunch i have a hard time finding snack foods that do not have wheat corn or some sort of sugar sweetener in them but these fit the bill they are very salty tho i like them that way but if you are not used to it and can be surprising ,sugar free salty goodness , delicious
these soy crisps are an excellent choice for snacking with grams of protein in each serving they are so much better for you than potato chips or other snack foods they have a great flavor just enough salt and leave you feeling satisfied nutritionally and my grandchildren know these crisps are what they will be offered at my house for snacking i highly recommend them ,soy crisps awesome snack , great taste
i recently found out that i am allergic to wheat and milk as you can imagine this severely limits my snacking options my local grocery was all of their organic section so i tried these they are so good i love salted plain rice cakes did before my diet change too these add an extra punch of flavor and crunch yum ,delicious , delicious
i have a very bad habit of snacking that i cannot get rid of so i purchased this to make snacking a little less bad the first time i tried it i was like ugh it is gross but soon it started to grow on me it is very crispy without being a deep fried potato chip it is lightly salted and does not have different fattening unhealthy seasonings and flavorings one entire bag is only like calories it is actually quite good i really like it now and i find reaching for a bag of before any type of chip ,not too , not as good as it is
these are the most consistent soy crisps i have had they are light flavorful and always fresh and usually arrive in very good condition not crumbs they are a bit salty but that is the only point that might be bad just depends on what you are expecting ,excellent crisps , not as good as
these soy crisps are very filling and satisfying if you are looking for something with a great salty crunch these are for you br br they are high in fiber and protein and that is great if you are trying to watch your calorie intake br br i think they are great and recommend them highly ,satisfying , great snack
i really love these snacks they are low in calories and fat while being high in protein which is important to me because i am a vegetarian ,yummy , great snack
i have been purchasing this product for about months the taste of the product is from lot number to lot number i have gotten cases where the chips had no flavor at all have contacted the manufacturer times have not received a response from my latest inquiry i do not recommend purchasing ,quality , great chips
eat and even snack healthier these had so many good reviews so i decided to try them i admit it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first when i opened them they looked totally and then i tasted them it tasted just like a rice cake styrofoam with salt on it they also have a very unusual texture the combination of taste and texture was very disappointing my teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way not even the dog would eat them we tried them with a variety of dips and could not come up with a tolerable way to choke them down br br luckily i have a niece that is newly vegetarian hungry all the time and she took these off my hands i am still out for buying the case of these to begin with what a waste ,terrible , not as good as i like
the product that i received was not the product that was pictured and described on the item page the worst part of it all was that when i attempted to return the case of soy crisps i was unable to do so amazon said that this was a non refundable item so i wasted and i am stuck with a case of soy crisps that i will not eat ,very , not as good as it is
this has been my favorite soup since childhood i was pleased to find it available on amazon com at a very reasonable price now i plan to keep a good supply on hand at all times ,yes it really is good , great product
these cookies are sooo good i just bought some at the grocery store today after craving raspberry sweets wow was this more than what i was expecting between the chocolate the raspberry and the cookie it is heavenly they actually put a nice and consistent amount of filling in these unlike most store bought brands i would definitely recommend them and i will surely buy them again when i am having a raspberry and chocolate craving ,delicious , great snack
i bake so i am rarely impressed by store bought cookies this one though divine so divine i do not like heavy chocolate or dark chocolate but i like a little chocolate this cookie is the right amount pastry raspberry and chocolate and it is light like a ,excellent store bought cookie , great taste
my girlfriend and i bought some of this at for or bucks worth every penny we use this on sandwiches instead of mayo it is the best stuff it is not healthy at all in fact it is really bad for you so keep that in mind ,so very good , best ever
i am a mustard lover i eat mustard on everything without a doubt it is the greatest unfortunately you can only buy in a few stores honey mayonnaise mustard br maggie ,mustard lover , great taste
i love this brand honey n mustard mayonnaise sauce it is the best combination that i have ever used makes a great dipping for cheeses ,brand honey n mustard sauce , great taste
love this product very to most anything works great on lunch meat ham potato salad more something similar is sold at honey baked ham but this product is much better ,great mustard , great product
so you can see where it is set it also feels a bit cheap it is lightweight and feels almost fragile treated with care it is fine but i doubt it would take much abuse before it would break and i have been ultra careful with it because it feels so lightweight and cheap i also used it as recommended in the and did not plug it directly into the back of the mic i used it with a mic cable br br for what i needed it was perfect simple plug and play that got good sound into my computer and it worked well in a pinch i just wish it was a little higher quality in terms of construction a bit heavier and a better dial for the gain and i would have rated it a full stars but as it is i can at best give it ,simple and that just worked , not as good as it is
a phantom power this little thing does it all it does exactly what it says it does nothing more and nothing less br i am not a professional by any means i just wanted to set up a small studio in my room and be able to have my mic go straight to my laptop without having to buy a small this might not work for someone who has a setup than mine but for my basic stuff it works amazing br br the only thing i was surprised about was the size in the picture it looks like its really small but its really like round and as long as my hand it in no way effects the performance or anything i just thought it was noteworthy br br if this was helpful please take a few seconds to hit the helpful button above i would really appreciate it ,i love it , not as good as i be
i have several of these in my home studio the quality is amazing on both dynamics and condenser mics i had an icicle that initially had a low hum contacted blue and they said that the first units produced had a low hum but that has since been fixed they sent me a replacement unit and it works perfectly now buy this product if you have the need ,awesome product , great product
the icicle is truly a great piece of hardware it is as simple as plugging your mic into the product and plugging that into your usb the best thing about this product is it allows you to take your mic wherever there is a usb computer it is light weight so i do not know it is durability and do not plan on throwing it to find out the icicle comes with a gain knob which is a plus but remember with this is a dollar plug n play tool so it does not have any other features br br also i did not have the noise feedback issue ,true n on the go a , great product
do br br i ve been finding ways to record vocal in convenient way with good quality everyone told me i am suppose to get audio interface for good vocal recording but audio always ended up with frustration br br after seeing several reviews of icicle i was going to return this but once i used it i do not think i want to return it anymore br br this preamp is way beyond my br br however like i mentioned above it has so this might not be a solution for many people br br it has no headphone jack for direct monitoring br no asio driver br only one input br does not look strong so always be careful br br if you are a person like me who just to need to record vocal conveniently using easy software like cool edit or audacity you will not regret ,simply great , good product but
just plug and play with your preferred software no worked great for about months then just stopped working did not drop it it is made of a flimsy plastic and is light as a feels cheap it just stopped working when i buy a product i do not just want it to work great for three months totally dissapointed ,worked great then , great product
i tried this on both mac os x and on not on the same computer and it worked perfectly with both although was a little confusing nothing more was involved than finding the right audio preferences no drivers in either case i a short review of the blue for each setup with each setup which i posted on my com you can search that out and listen to both of them if you have any doubts about the sound the whole thing lights up blue when it is plugged in so if you love blue this mic for you i have a condenser mic about the least expensive mic you can find but it sounded great before and it sounds great through the blue icicle ,works great , great product
how it should be make sure you raise the levels up in sound in control panel if the mic sounds too low for you even with the gain control volume up it should not be up that high anyways as it would have some feedback in the background i am not sure if i am the only one with this problem but i hope this helps whoever does br br when i first got the icicle it sounded amazing and i had a lot of fun with it i still do too i use this with my audio technica at i use it almost everyday whether if it is for music producing or online with friends and yes this does work for the ps not sure about the though i recommend this product for anyone who does not have a mixer for their microphone because are kind of expensive haha ,this for a year windows problem , the best for a price
owned two of these and when they work they are fine the power knob has no indicator on it though my biggest problem and the reason i will never purchase another is this both gave out with in a year one now sounds like i am recording from behind a wall and one developed a hum that will not go away do yourself a favor and find a more reliable option ,too cheap , good
great audio until a few months in it just decides to stop working common problem google it and you will see cheapest construction of any product every designed in the entire world feels like a fast food toy br br i do not recommend this product piece o garbage ,it it was okay , great product
good clean clear sound level near the of input level br br this is one very disappointing product if you route your mic through a preamp then put the icicle between the preamp and the usb input of your computer you can get a decent record level but that extra equipment is what this light weight is supposed to avoid personally i think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip or mic preamp and an xlr to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the icicle altogether br br blue makes some great products but this is not one of their better ones br br for those that do not know channel strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box typically a mic preamp and a higher end units add some eq as well or have other options ,your mic , not as good as i be
great usb audio interface i also own the shure x u and they perform just about the same i wish i would have known that before i spent way more on the x u ,works great , great product
this product was awesome the first couple months i was convinced i was over any potential defective period well after caring for it well and giving it no reason not to work it of course stopped working for me i now cannot use it for anything serious anything i record that is or important runs the risk of cutting out half way without giving any warning leaving me with half a recording of audio and half with there must be some crappy design inside the tube that prevents a solid connection i am just happy it is not my blue microphone do not waste your money on the icicle it is ability has an expiration ,not for long use , great product
cheap a plastic tube with some presumably lightweight inside never worked right no user interface no known way to or the phantom power ,cheap , not as good as it is
here at tv and i kid you not it sounds amazing with this piece of kit have plugged into our mac and thrown the signal into audacity and or final cut pro and it sounds the business no hum noise or pop we use it to voice the children series jack and both the and the tech staff find it a really easy and portable set up to use ok looks are not great and it is plastic but i do not really give a about that all i care about is the signal to noise ratio the sound quality and can it power our very expensive mics the answer is yes it can we say buy br br a href http www amazon com gp product b am jack and christmas us format a a href http www amazon com gp product b jack and christmas european format a ,the , great product
i already have the from blue and was using it to record a friend live performance with only a laptop computer at my i was able to connect my xlr to usb directly into garageband the icicle is small portable and so easy to use plus i did not have to carry a huge a to d converter ,cool stuff , great product
i was told by the at guitar center that the icicle was easy and very high quality it is perfectly easy but i have had nothing but problems from mine there is a constant popping in anything i record i am using an c b microphone i have had for a long time and it is in perfect condition so the problem is not with my mic anyone else having this problem have not been in touch with tech support yet but i will say i am not happy with the icicle ,very , not as good as it is
icicle is a pretty good preamp for the price br br very easy setup and a cool design but definitely was not very it is very light and made of plastic br but the one things that i did not like was the noise it had a fair amount of buzz along with it br br a cheap preamp for the price but you get what you pay for ,not bad not great , not as good as it is
i find that even with the gain on maximum the volume is not very loud i use it with a shure sm mic and my using audacity one must be very close to the mike and speak somewhat when i use the shure mics with a mixer the way there are no volume problems br br it is simple to set up being almost plug and play you have to choose the input source ,poor with , not as good as it is
read a few reviews some good and some bad and i finally decided to take the risk since the icicle was on sale br br works great and is perfect for a home room studio br br i love everything blue though the icicle is a little light and delicate i treat it as careful as i do my microphone br br i would highly recommend this product ,works awesome , great product
have only had the need to use this a few times but it has always well and consistently nice that it has a little preamp so you can control levels does not seem to color the tone in any negative way ,works well , great product
the product was simply not recognized by my windows home premium computer very disappointed considering on the blue website it says that it is i gave this the extra star because im sure its a great product but the lack of of the was very disappointing most likely wont be buying anything else from blue ,not with windows , not as good as it is
i have little doubt that the blue icicle will get the job done with a shure sm or similar dynamic microphone but its claim that it will convert any condenser mic even one that normally requires xlr connection and phantom power into a plug n play usb mic should not be taken at face value i say this because i have an with the original audio technica at condenser mic who had and success when he tried such a in the long run he would have been ahead in terms of both the and saving a few bucks by purchasing the at usb mic as it is the blue icicle is probably the best such converter on the market the priced cable will not convert condenser mics despite what you may have read so if necessary give it a try and more than one but make sure there are return ,if it works not always a solution , best of the best i have ever had
works fine for my needs i use it with a sure sm microphone it is made of plastic and does feel cheap but i have had it for a few months and had zero problems with it for use it should be fine works great for my needs would not recommend for heavy use on a stage or being tossed around ,decent price for a good product , not as good as it is
it does what it says i was only worried that either it would not be compatible with my mic or that my computer would not recognize it but everything turned out great it is plug and play my computer running windows instantly recognized it and i was able to use this right away in less than minutes from it br br it seemed like a joke to me at first because it is so small and lightweight so i thought it would not actually supply phantom power or something like that but it actually does so this is pretty great what i love most about this is that it is extremely portable and easy to set up i definitely recommend this ,works great , not as good as it is
this device does one thing and it does it well i use it to record and it provides a crisp clean sound with zero noise i have read some reviews where people complain about the durability of the icicle while it feels a little i hardly think it will snap in half the price is right and the sound is great br br for the most part setting the icicle up is incredibly easy i had a few where i had to for windows to recognize it again and such but no serious headaches br br overall this is a great device to have on hand of for the traveling who wants to quickly lay down ideas on the road ,low to , not as good as it is
this thing is great i am running a into the icicle into logic and the sound i am getting is tremendous there is little to no noise but it the signal plenty i have had no trouble with not having enough gain i have plenty of sound another thing is that i do not think it feels as light and toy like as a lot of people here have stated just treat it with care and do not drop it like any piece of equipment fantastic buy for the money recommended ,what a little , great product
i have used the icicle a few times and it sounds great everything works how it is supposed to and it is a very simple but efficient interface the only thing that i can see that is wrong with it is it just feels light and cheap granted its only around so you cannot expect too much from it the plastic just feels rather cheap but i plan on it very nicely and gently anyways so all in all i do not a major problem on that front ,very good , not as good as it is
i was somewhat skeptical about purchasing any xlr to usb but i have to say this thing works great the recordings are crisp and clear just as good as recording on my in now i can record directly to my pc without the need of mini and the audio to the computer the unit is a bit cheap feeling weight wise but do not let that fool you one bit br br it true plug and play too no need for any additional drivers software simply plug everything together and you are off and running overall it is a great product i highly recommend this for anyone who does any amount of voice recording ,this is hot , great product
computer i was at an for a long time until i saw this product on blue website i already had a condenser mic in the i had never gotten to use and did not want to spend more money on a quality usb mic i could not be happy that this product exists in it is quality or price i noticed no noise or of the signal and it worked without a problem it does exactly what it is suppose to do like it does not exist it just serves it purpose to convert the signal well and stays out of the way on everything else it does feel light weight and the signal was a little lower than i thought as many reviews said and that is the only reason i did not give it stars but i do not think that should keep anyone from getting this product ,great product price , not as good as i be
have also beaten the crap out of this thing knocked it around way too much and left it on the floor at my desk where i record no problems still runs fine and it is not showing any signs of stopping this thing is also super easy plug and record on any software including the free audacity software garage band and acid the three i have tested br one problem that gain knob while very useful is super super i found a volume i liked and then it down otherwise it will jack up or down the gain with the slightest does not make this a bad product it just means have some tape handy and this is a quick and easy solution especially for who do not want to be limited to the usb microphones and do not want to shell out big money for a usb compatible mixer ,quick easy , great product
using it for recording vocals on home pc using shure c mic it is a big improvement over the mic to in for sure there is no background noise which was very in the mic in method the stars instead of is due to the gain even with the gain knob turned all the way up i still had to add gain from my software for the sound to be loud enough but overall a great product do not regret buying it and would recommend it as well ,works but does not have enough , not as good as it is
ive heard mixed reviews of this yeah it feels cheap but so what just take care of it like you would anything like that and it sounds perfect i use it to record vocals on logic studio i get others to i cannot but they sound amazing ive had no problems with it and im super happy with the purchase well worth the money ,way better than i thought , not as good as it is
no need for a wall br br cons very plastic feels like it could snap with the slightest bit of rough handling i would not try to plug it directly into a mic use an xlr cable no headphone monitoring jack and quite a bit of when monitoring with a separate interface i would not recommend it for dynamic mics i tried it with my dynamic mic and could not get high enough levels without practically into the mic i also tried it with an old v tech stage mic and levels were a little better so dynamics with a higher line output might work better with it br br overall it does what it is supposed to but it could be a lot better for about more you can get better with mic but this one is nice for situations where running off of usb power is a must ,could be better but it works and it is inexpensive , not as good as i be
simple plug in setup garageband it right away as long as it is opened as first step before plugging in icicle nice clean transparent sound without much coloring with my stage mic depending upon your setup you may have to up your and headphone to get comfortable levels blue recommends plugging directly into computer a great little device for the price ,clean easy , great popcorn
brought this product for recording a program from home along with the br c microphone provides a cost effective solution ,value for money , great product
the level from this unit was hard to adjust and when all was said and done it was very low ,mic for , great product
i have some nice mics round my place for video and thought i could use them to help my and for the money it is amazing little usb device ,great value way to use my nice mic , great taste
i was a little concerned after some of the reviews here but the blue reputation and amazon customer service convinced me to give it a try and in general i am pretty satisfied with it using it with one of my microphones i get excellent sound no hum and so far excellent i am using it with audacity and a few other programs none of which have any difficulty it there were some issues setting it up initially and i am a bit about the plastic construction but for what i paid i think it is a good value for those thinking of using it in field recording stick it inside a carrying bag and tape the cable to it to prevent the usb you should not have any problems ,pretty good for the money , not as good as it is
i have several different ways of xlr microphones to my computers for use in and i thought this design would be to transport and connect but when i tried to use it with a shure sm mic the volume it produced was about of what i am used to and was not adequate for my purpose ,does not enough , not as good as it is
we have only had the blue icicle week but my daughter loves it and is working with it every day br br how good is it my daughter is and turned down a year in money to music program as a her voice is so perfectly re produced using a shure and the icicle that i can not tell when she and when she it back through the computer an off the shelf using a pair of computer for sound br br the icicle is really good br br now they can replace the old tv commercial from is it live or is it br to is it live or is it blue ,great product beautiful , great product
it does record with ease and decent quality for the price the only problem is it acts as a sound card and you cannot record and listen to yourself at the same time without this is a deal for me blue microphones should add a headphone jack onto the interface so you do not have to listen to recordings through your computer and you can hear your recordings in real time ,cannot what your without , great product
the that of the icicle i connected the icicle using the motorola cable into my windows pc and to my surprise it was recognized i actually got the idea when the icicle began losing its usb connection with the original cable whenever i moved it around a lot could it be the looking usb cable included with the causing or driver problems with windows i am really not sure at this point what i can say is that the blue icicle seems reliable when used with the old motorola usb cable perhaps the motorola cable makes better contact or has better who knows i m inclined to cut away the white insulation of the original icicle cable just see if it is to the usb ground source it would not be the first time i find an usb cable then again it might be the mini usb causing the problem ,works great no and has a high with a smooth , not as good as it is
this does not work on windows tried software and to no surprise it t work this was a waste of time and money be aware of this issue ,did not work on windows , good stuff
this icicle performs with very good audio quality for my audio technica mic took me a short while to figure out the little silver button on the side was not a button but instead a knob for setting the gain this device literally into your usb port on a mac you adjust that knob and your done you then can forget about the device and enjoy audio performance out of your mic this beats the hell out of the more expensive i had used before ,on , great product
all their that is one way to save a but please people if you are going to give us technical support then say so if it is not really technical support then say it is customer service br br i am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to the newer windows has been out for some time now there is no indication in the little mini that comes in the icicle package that says windows is it only gives set up info for mac and windows does not show which os i am sending my icicle back to amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that will work with windows br br if you have a pc that was purchased in or later save yourself the hassle and do not bother with this product as your os will more than likely be windows ,does not work with windows , not as good as it is
picked one up to use with a laptop running windows home premium the computer saw the item but said it needed nothing worked after researching online i found that many people had run into this problem apparently the is not compatible with windows it is supposedly been corrected in newer runs but there is no way to tell if the one you are purchasing is newer or not i tried contacting blue twice hoping to get a update or check into it but never got a response from both attempts so i finally just had to return it ,windows , not as good as it is
youtube calls and recording music it all works great br br when i first received it in the mail i simply opened it plugged it in and it worked as simple as that there were no drivers no and no i just plugged my xlr condenser microphone into the icicle and the icicle to the usb on my computer and it was immediately recognized as a usb mic br br this product was way lighter than i expected and feels rather cheap however that is not really an issue because the product works great and the blue that lights up when you plug it in adds some nice visual appeal br br the knob is also useful as it allows you to control the sensitivity of the mic br br overall i am extremely satisfied with this product as it is plug and play very simple and it just works ,great product , great product
possibly this loading process however that did not work for me its easier to return this thing than spend my whole weekend around in windows hardware manager br br blue probably has a good product here and probably windows for this issue however blue should provide a driver that works do not rely on windows to do this that is corporate spend some on something that works for windows make it available on your support website and make it true plug and play not plug and cross fingers then spend hours around in the weeds of windows settings br br also agree with other reviews here in the days i spent with this product it is all plastic parts feels cheap and fragile and the gain button is poorly thought out br br hey blue you had my business then you lost me i am moving on to something else ,windows , not as good as it is
i use this with my audio technica works great for home recordings hooked up to garageband on pro for rough recordings its super simple to use and has a dial for the gain it is not which is a nice ,great little extra for , great product
this people is a must have especially to take xlr over to usb it provides un audio flow during recording and provides phantom power great ,another great product , great product
this thing works instantly you plug in your mic and plug the usb into your computer it will light up then you adjust the sound to what is audible it can get pretty loud i was at first when the purchase because of the low price but it has done everything i needed it for the other preamp models i was looking at were near br br the only downside to this is that it looks plastic i do not consider it a con because the look doesnt really matter ,excellent for the price , great product
purchased and it came looking new as i had bought it new but it was actually damaged br customer service with the actual company is awful as i needed to contact the company itself to return it ,came damaged , not as good as it is
the icicle is an excellent product works as advertised i think it is the easiest way to a quality mic directly to your computer br the icicle is a fine plug play mic interface ,mic , great product
going from the to this tube made me feel like i got back at for all of us who had xp computers that they refused to support after we bought their over priced for recording voice overs br i could wish that the blue ice converter was made of heavier materials and came with a department that one could reach but for well said ,new inexpensive for over priced to mic , not as good as it is
used it a couple of times over the course of a month and it worked great third time high pitched noise and no mic signal coming through not too surprising given how flimsy this thing feels this is apparently a known issue just look at other star reviews of this product nuff said ,after , great product
this product has worked since the first day i have had it tremendous buy for me i needed my mic to go directly into the computer thanks ,worked for me , great product
bought this because i didnt want to pay plus for the alternative found it to be extremely reliable very crisp sound with little to no background noise before i bought it other reviews stated it seemed a bit cheap i disagree though i do find it to be a bit for it is function i did drop and break it once but it was completely my fault after breaking it i contacted customer service and it was replaced very rapidly the company website was easy to and rather ,cheap solution , not as good as it is
i wanted to like this product as it would have been a fast and easy solution for many of my needs but it did not work well at all very lots of hissing and pops that are completely absent when using the same mics and computers with other adapter considering the decent reviews by others i may just have a defective unit either way it is going back in the mail today ,not for me , great product
i bought this before i purchased the mxl it is plastic and very made i felt like it would break very easily and would not be something that would last me a while so then i bought the it is solid metal and is way better sound quality than this i beg you to buy that over the icicle buy the mxl used like new from a great seller and it is a great product a href http www amazon com gp product b mxl xlr to usb preamp for condenser microphones a ,not very good at all made is far , not as good as it is
i do not write reviews at all but i am just going to say that this is a very decent product to buy if you are not looking to spend hundreds of dollars on a mixer phantom power supply and pre amp for xlr mic recording because guess what this little thing has it all in one all for a low price you one ,awesome worth it , not as good as it is
connection to my desk and now i move it very little aside from the no dial or for how far you have turned it on the gain knob i think it would be awesome if they just threw in some molded heavy something to give it some weight for setting on your desk that would make it secure and you would feel like it had a little better quality in hey maybe even give the itself a weight to stay put anyways great product but i guess thats what he said regardless br br pros does what it says get it if you need it its at an amazing price compared to the a href http www amazon com gp product b shure x u xlr to usb signal adapter a version this however is fantastic for people saving for a new interface like me br br cons appears lacking ,almost five , not as good as you
plugged direct into windows and controlled via tv software interface this worked well although we needed a little more gain by using better software garage band etc as an setup before we could get a more pro level interface for more than one mic etc nice br it feels a bit flimsy construction wise but we were not going to take it on the road ,used for mic , great product
i use this to record in garageband on my it works and sounds as good as it should considering my setup i love the level knob and the quality construction if you read the instructions and use it correctly this tool is ,just what i needed , great product
this product works if you are only looking to do vocals this is a good product so far i have had it a few months with no experience of sound or loss of power its great if you do not want to go to the trouble of figuring out how to use a mixer i have been told a pre amp is better but it seems to work alright for me and my mxl g ,it works , great product
i have purchased a few of these and they are very reliable i have used them with win and os x the a d quality is acceptable for most needs the limited bit depth and sample rate are probably the only drawbacks ,works well if all you need is bit , great taste
i was really worried when i ordered this that the phantom power would make it apparently i was worried for nothing i use this paired with a blue pro a seriously microphone running over cable that is about feet away it is absolutely great br br the one downside that i have seen from this piece of kit it will occasionally not as a usb device granted i only have seen it happen once but you will always want to double check your ,cold as ice , not as good as it is
cheap and works well the only thing is the gain on it is a little low even at highest setting other than that records well and does what it needs to ,the is decent , not as good as it is
never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for and music recordings for the price paid it is very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired overall i can not recommend this product at the current price it is sold at to dollars then sure still it is an ok product ,a bit and made , not as good as it is
i create language teaching materials for a living on both and not only do i care about the sound quality of audio recordings for voice but i record a lot of music as well for work i that i do at home i bought the blue microphones icicle to use with high quality condenser mics before buying i read lots of reviews here and some others online br br when the icicle arrived it worked fine right of the bat since then i have hours and hours of audio on it using both and not once have i had any problems with the product ,does the and does it well , not as good as it is
perfect tool for any trying to make recording much easier at an affordable price br easy to open plastic case medium sized durable people have said that the plastic body feels cheap br and feels easy to break but it is not true the icicle plastic body feels durable and will not break if br you re not with it or break it on purpose i only wished that the gain control had numbers or br of levels so i can turn the knob to the correct position for recording and remember it instead of guessing all the time sound quality is no or anything picked up really just nice crispy sound through a good quality microphone is all i hear i hear no difference in it with an icicle or a mixer ,perfect , great product
this product works just as advertised guitar center told me the only way to connect my mic to my computer was either an expensive converter box or a usb mic a holes haha i love this little and would definitely recommend it to a friend ,works perfect , great product
which is a pretty high end condenser mic although now you can find it for cheap but original and average selling price after it being out was but i am very happy br br i use to record vocals with a asio driver and it does work with my asio driver someone put in their comment that it doesnt for those of you that with asio it is a driver program that runs and samples your audio going in you basically use it with anything that is or mic to usb it makes your audio not and sound more professional also for the people that said the volume was too low go into sound in windows and turn the mic up a little i keep mine on also your recording program will let you turn up while your monitoring the record or after br br go ahead and buy one ,awesome buy for sure , good product
i am glad i came across the blue icicle on amazon prices where or more before i went on to buy a mic preamp and source for phantom power i literally got i all in one at a low price good bargain i recomend it for anyone with a home studio and go buy a xlr cable plugging a mic into it wont work so well ,good , great product
a great tool for low budget home recording i mic every track to audacity i use a low budget dynamic mic and the icicle gives the right boost for pc recording i keep the gain at to percent and do volume control on the pc br i see some complaints out there about durability keep in mind it is a piece of computer hardware like a or an hard drive not something that you would use or throw into a bag another plus is no drivers or setup that is important to me when i get home from work and want to record a just plug it in and go ,cost effective solution for low home , great product
i needed the icicle to provide better audio quality for recordings i was doing on my pc i wanted to use my high quality xlr mic for this purpose and found that the icicle provided far better performance than any other usb mic that i currently owned i did not have any problem with the trim pod on the icicle as reported by a previous review so maybe blue mic has corrected that issue br br i have and do recommend this to anyone that wants to use their current xlr mic on their pc the product is great and the price is right ,works great , not as good as it is
great price for what you are getting recording via a usb port rocks the only thing that could maybe be improved is the durability it feels like a toothpick in your hand it may be more durable than it feels but i am still going to be very careful with it but for the price this is only a minor gripe great product i would recommend it to anyone ,excellent buy , great product
works well it is slightly lighter than expected but the quality of the sound is excellent ,like a small , good but not great
i used the icicle for about two hours after taking a break i plug it in and my laptop wont recognize it i did everything i could think of to fix this even hours of searching google nothing in the process of a return it would have been perfect if it just worked ,worked for then , great product
it works reasonably well with condenser microphones with dynamics the hum the signal works with windows not with the build is very cheap anything more than for this is too much ,this one on the , great product
ntilde o lo a con laptop y n de con la de audio mi mac con el icicle el no de n y la es simple ,y , not as good as
i bought this device and use a brand new sure with it br br the noise and feedback i received with this device was horrible i might have a bad unit br br when i called customer service a real person answered right away and offered to getting me a new unit very cool and is why i gave them stars for now br br i ll see how that process goes and update my review ,still up in the , not as good as it is
bought it thinking this would plug into the and i would be able to use my condenser microphone with it well long story short doesnt work but it is still usable with a pc laptop to record audio but we can do that with a mic also would u like to pay towards the ,no good for , great product
shipping ordered on a sunday of week placed in box on a friday of week received it of week whoever responsible for shipping amazon or blue took their sweet time to drop it in this x box br br product currently testing the converter with a shure pg gain is incredibly low and a annoying tone when recording i do believe the product is in working condition too bad i have to figure out how to edit the hardware properly ,not too happy far , not as good as it is
i ordered this item on march nd i expect to get its replacement from the people at blue sometime today so what is a month anyway the first one that came from amazon had a constant high pitched tone i emailed then called blue and eventually spoke to a pleasant tech support guy who was aware of the problem he allowed that the company had shipped out a number of units with this defect that is always good to hear so several emails later i received a return merchandise and shipped it right back to them who knows if this one works maybe i will like it blue products look good but they make a strong case for buying locally ,a quality control , not as good as it is
this product is excellent for the group of people who have celiac disease a tasty treat for sunday the only problem i have is the cost but br as we all know being with celiac disease is not cheap ,a product for , great snack
so life with a gluten allergy can sometimes seem however once bisquick started making this product things got a lot more equal it tastes like bisquick it works like bisquick hey it is bisquick it just happens to be gluten free perfect pancakes enough said ,perfect pancakes enough , gluten free bisquick
finally a gluten free mix that tastes great i have used this mix over and over and i have never been disappointed it works just the way the regular mix works and it has opened up a whole new world for me i thought i would never be able to find a mix that i like but this one i love i am excited about trying all the fun things i can do with it even cookies ,great stuff , gluten free bisquick
the first time we cracked open a box of bisquick gluten free and made a batch of pancakes i was surprised they were delicious perhaps the best pancakes i have ever had we did make a couple modifications from the box recipe instead of using oil we use the same amount of melted butter and we add fresh blueberries to each pancake as it is cooking then serve with whipped cream so great i am looking forward to trying some of the other recipes with this including pizza crust ,bisquick gf so delicious , gluten free bisquick
i really like it when my wife makes anything from her betty crocker cookbook so i know when we got the gluten free pancakes that they would be good they are not overly dry like some of the other brands of gluten free pancakes br br we usually have them with earth balance butter spread and sliced bananas or sliced strawberries chopped pecans or walnuts and maple syrup they are great ,really good gluten free pancakes , gluten free bisquick
a few years ago going gluten free was really difficult i missed the basic things i loved to eat and pancakes were certainly one of them i tried other mixes but the were very dry and required items to them such as fruit etc but bisquick gf pancake mix was surprisingly good it is a great alternative to the real thing certainly all of us gluten out there know it will never be that delicious stack of buttermilk pancakes like we once knew but i am happy to know there is a great alternative ,great alternative , great for gluten free
this many of other brands of pizza crust mix cake mix and more the only reason i do not give it stars is that it is slightly pricey but that is an issue of living gluten free enjoy and be creative with it ,excellent product versatile and convenient , not as good as it is
as far as gluten free products this is awesome i use it as a substitute for any recipe that asks for flour it makes great pumpkin waffles ,great gluten free product , great product
finally a gluten free pancake product pancakes not to bad taste like regular bisquick the batter is just right not too heavy pancakes this was a good price compared to local grocers ,finally , gluten free bisquick
this is a very product love it my husband must eat gluten free and my kids prefer pancakes made with this ,awsome , great gluten free bisquick
my son who has celiacs loves the pancakes you can make from these and so do i and i will eat them even though i do not need to eat gf highly recommend ,as good as regular bisquick , great product
i have now served gluten free bisquick pancake and waffle mix to several of our friends and relatives i usually make waffles and have even done a taste test with regular bisquick and people everyone liked gluten free best i am so happy that i can buy it on amazon as it is twice as much in the grocery stores thank you for carrying this great product br ca ,everyone loves gluten free bisquick , great for gluten free
after searching many local stores to find this product i ordered it via amazon i took the advice of other reviewers ordered the pack i have only made pancakes w it but they are delicious some complain that they are bland i always add a little something to flavor my pancakes a few drops of vanilla a sprinkle of cinnamon had these pancakes tasting wonderful my yr old loved them i highly recommend you try the gf bisquick ,great simple gf mix , great for
i have been gluten free for a little over a year and i have struggled with finding tasty and affordable alternatives to my favorite foods the great thing about this mix is that it is really easy to make affordable and the pancakes are so tasty my children do not object to eating them saving me the time of making two batches of pancakes if they did not see me eating them i do not even think my kids would notice that they are eating gluten free pancakes ,easy and tasty , great product
been gluten free for years now thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful we threw it away because we did not like it for my money you cannot beat pamela baking mix but the betty crocker chocolate chips are the best so do not give up betty crocker just work on this one ,yuck do not waste your money , great product
wow it is delicious br the kids love it br we made it for breakfast this morning the pancakes were eaten in no time at all br the only complaint was that there was not more br actually it was disappointing that the boxes were not bigger ,so , great product
dry ingredients but found that the batter came out thin and the texture was gummy then one day when i was visiting my mother she decided to make pancakes and since i am gf she had bought this mix for me not knowing i had already hated it i saw that she measured the ingredients as she used the same measuring cup generally used to measure liquids for both the dry and the liquid ingredients she also used a to mix the ingredients amazingly enough the pancakes came out fluffy and i really liked it in fact it is my favorite gluten free pancake mix so far having said that both my husband and i are of the opinion that this product still has a bit of the gritty texture that is present in many gf products however it is the best pancake mix that i have found so far ,pretty good , a great for a great for pancakes
best bisquick pancakes i have ever made i think these are better than the original bisquick pancakes my husband even loved these i would recommend buying this product ,amazing , great for pancakes
you will not find a better gluten free pancake mix out there as a matter of fact i much prefer these gluten free pancakes to regular pancakes and i buy them for my husband i love bisquick for this product ,the best gf mix out there , gluten free bisquick
when i found gf bisquik in the stores i was happy when i found it on amazon with a good price as a subscription i was thrilled our daughter lives in texas and is gluten intolerant so i mail her items on a regular basis this has become a staple in her kitchen anything you can make with regular bisquik you can adapt using this so now she makes cookies pancakes and biscuits to her heart content taste and texture of items made with it are good ,for gf , great for gluten free
it makes good tasting gluten free food but like most gluten free food it is expensive and it is got a slight grit to it i have made biscuits waffles and pancakes with it a friend made some awesome banana bread with it it is very good for gluten free ,good but still , gluten free bisquick
it is great i actually used this to make gf donuts the other day i love how convenient it is it is so hard being gluten free so this is god sent for how many things you can make with this i have celiacs and i have not had any sort of negative reaction to this i would definitely recommend this for anyone who cannot have gluten but still wants things like pancakes and waffles and donuts and other fun things ,fantastic , great for gluten free
the first brand of gf pancake mix i attempted was bob red mill and i loved it i went to the store to try to find it again and this was all they had so i tried it it okay i am egg free too and used banana instead so maybe that to the slight mushy texture but i made a batch of egg ones for my in and they said it was a bit mushy too br br it not horrible but i prefer brand personally ,meh not bad but a little bit of a mushy texture , not as good as it is
we use this mix for pancakes and waffles and it is perfect we have had a terrible time finding a good all purpose flour that is gluten free the popular brands taste terrible so we tend to use this pancake mix as a base for a lot of our recipes including breading for baked chicken and other things it is definitely best as a pancake mix of course but using it as a starting point for baking has helped us find normal tasting gluten free baked foods ,perfect , great product
i recently went gluten free and this is one of my favorite mixes i used it for biscuits and pancakes and it is very good you can also use it for pizza dough and to make fried chicken it is about average for that ,keep this on my , great product
i could not believe how great this mix tasted it like eating the regular one it came out soooooo good fluffy and delicious ,the best gluten free pancake mix , great product
i find it hard to express how pleased i was to find bisquick in a gluten free form i have tried countless recipes using of rice and potato flour and none of them tasted good the bisquick bisquits are delicious but i could not make satisfactory dumplings with the mix ,a for gluten people , great product
my son loves these pancakes much healthier alternative to the original i am excited to try the other recipes soon ,makes great pancakes , great product
for you what i do know it that it is a great option for people trying br to eat as normal as possible this gf option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosed br with celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting gf options or super simple meat and vegetables options for meals br br we have made all types of breakfast items biscuits even fried food chicken sticks fried fruit we bout our own little br br http www amazon com dp b q ref as til tag camp creative as b q br br in short it has not only been a great option but also has been quite tasty allowing my wife to make one meal for both of us not worrying that br it will taste bad to me br br hope this was helpful ,it tastes good , not bad but not great
i find it really hard to believe this is gf because it tastes better than any gf product i have ever had i made waffles with it this morning and i did not even want butter or syrup it was that amazing i want proof that this truly gf ,no way , not as good as it is
this is a great product for us gluten free people we use it for everything from pancakes waffles to cookies scones cooking ,great , great product
so grateful for this what an amazing mix it can be used to make some of the best gluten free products out there what a break through for us gluten free individuals who miss real mixes some of the other ones on the market just dont do the trick like this does ,amazing , great product
i have tried many gluten free products on the market and this is by far the easiest and more product yet thank you betty crocker ,bisquick gluten free , gluten free bisquick
thank you thank you thank you i have an intolerance for gluten and bisquick is my i have tried some of those other packed product and invested in loads of ingredients to make my own mix but bisquick has saved me from myself again thank you thank you thank you ,to my belly , great product
my children can not have wheat gluten soy dairy eggs it is very hard to find products that they can have we use this for pancakes pizza crust cakes basically we just use it in place of flour it is so nice to be able to buy bisquick in the grocery stores now however it is much cheaper through amazon ,finally , great product
i was hoping bisquick got it right when they released this product but they missed their mark br br i made both biscuits and dumplings chicken dumplings the biscuits came out okay but the flavor was bland the dumplings were fluffy but not very flavorful and turned hard after a day or two ,a bit disappointing , not as good as it is
has this texture and taste thing with gluten free products as well gritty or off tasting etc etc so i am happy he likes this one with gluten free products you really have to test them out one by one as some perform in the taste and texture area better than other blends my advice to anyone searching for gluten free products they want to try that it is best to buy them in the single packages if possible i know on amazon they sell them in bulk but if you find that you do not like it you are then stuck with alot of packages you no longer want just a tip for all of you out there it may cost more for one package but the waste will be much less unless you donate them to the local food bank good product and great results thank you bisquick ,good stuff , gluten free bisquick
i like the bisquick it works great in a variety of uses wish it came in a bigger box the recipes are good on the box though ,bisquick , great product
neither myself nor my husband can have any type of corn products but we love cornbread this mix makes biscuits that taste just like corn bread to us nice to find an alternative that tastes so great appreciate having this order size option as well since it is often missing from grocery store shelves ,tasty non corn muffins , great product
i love this such a great product for all us gluten free folks it works the same as the regular bisquick their website has tons of gf recipes too this makes delicious pancakes and magic crust pies yummy ,this is a great product , great product
this is great as a pancake mix it almost has a corn texture to it i rate everything by if my son will eat it he is super picky and loves the pancakes i tried making biscuits with the mix that did not turn out very well but as far as pancakes it rocks ,great pancakes , great for a great price
great taste texture flavor and works well with any recipe wonderful pricing too gluten free products are so expensive normally definitely recommend this ,perfect , great product
i received this item on time the packaging was great the gluten free bisquick is a great addition to our gluten free pantry ,gluten free bisquick , great for gluten free
i was disappointed when i tried this pancake mix before going gluten free bisquick was our go to pancake mix so i had high expectations for the gluten free mix the texture was a little weird soft and dry i prefer the pamela pancake mix over this one ,so so pancake mix , great for gluten free
i first discovered gluten free biscuit in the supermarket i bought it and loved it i then tried to find it again in all the local supermarkets but could not find it i called the manufacturer and they informed me that i could purchase it at amazon i was thrilled amazon is one of my favorite web sites ,my gluten free bisquick review , great product
i had no idea there was a gluten free bisquick mix i made pancakes and they were great and the tea cakes also ,bisquick gluten free , great for
bisquick has made a wonderful gluten free product from pancakes to biscuits and everything in between are light and fluffy garlic and cheddar or cinnamon and sugar is a great addition ,great , great for gluten free
stirring would gum it up so i left some lumps in and they dissolved while cooking br br the texture of the cooked pancakes was very slightly gritty makes pancakes a little thinner than with regular bisquick however thick enough that i would say they are just right see photo added br br i used a cast iron to make the pancakes which made them barely crisp outside and nice tender inside very good br br the taste is close to regular bisquick but a little more plain i use real maple syrup and sometimes preserves and with either of the two toppings i had a very good very tasty short stack br br my only is that this mix is a little pricey but i would rather buy this mix than other gf products i have tried that are just as pricey and do not taste nearly as good ,makes a pancake , not as good as i be
i love pancakes so giving up gluten was hard for me i have used bisquick for pancakes for years with great results alas the best i got from the gluten free version was edible but not enjoyable it tasted a lot like foam not in a good way i will probably keep the mix for breading things but not for pancakes i have found much better options ,not for pancakes , great for gluten free
i have this on auto ship because i use it so much i have gone to every grocery in az and the cheapest place is amazon this is a great product and whatever you make using this flour will taste great my son has celiac and is allergic to gluten i have tried every pancake mix and this one is the one i settled for ,is amazon , great product
these tasted so good i was surprised because i have heard so many negative things about free bread products i would eat these by choice not because i have to ,yummy , great taste
this mix makes great belgian waffles we tried biscuits and pancakes and we do far better form scratch with a standard gf flour it does make seriously great waffles though and we go gf df on these the waffles freeze extremely well and in the toaster quite nicely ,great for waffles other just ok , great product
we have tried pamela second best bob red mill and king gluten free flour mixes for pancakes waffles breading pie biscuits and dumplings bisquick has been the most reliable we whole recommend it for those who bake at home but need to avoid gluten ,the best , great product
a local walmart after trying to find bread that i liked that is gluten free stay away from the ener g brand in my opinion br br i have been gluten free for weeks now and seriously craving bread products i made some pancakes this morning from this product and wow very tasty very light i needed to thin them a bit more to have them spread correctly but this was the first real carb product that was bread like that i have eaten in weeks needless to say i ate too many and now have a carb headache br br seriously though this product used in moderation may help you not miss your gluten products quite as much i look forward to making bisquits and some of the other recipes on the box br way to go on this product it a home run in the gluten free market ,absolutely a , fantastic gluten free
i made delicious banana pancakes last week using this product and over the weekend a family favorite from years ago chicken and dumplings which was on the betty crocker website under gf we could not tell the difference between the gf and regular mix in the results i made the recipe from scratch for six using chicken breasts and thighs till tender in chicken broth baby carrots celery cut green beans onion and seasonings and stirred up some white gravy to pour over the dish before serving loved it ,gf bisquick never , great product
i use this to quickly make gluten egg dairy free pancakes i use rice milk and egg replacer to make pancakes they taste pretty good and are a good snack to make for later and store in the fridge they are especially good w either apple butter or peanut butter on them besides the usual maple syrup ,gluten free pancakes , great for gluten free
this stuff is pretty solid makes a decent enough pancake for being gf and makes a solid biscuit as well what we have found works best is taking this mix and using it half and half with the mix between the two it makes for a very nice flour mix the is good but on its own tends to be a little squishy but when you mix it with the bisquick the bit of gives the dryer bisquick the and it needs so i recommend this but i would highly recommend getting some too and cutting the bisquick with it also even though this mix has leavening agents in it when we use recipes that call for leavening agents we add them anyway it tends to turn out better this way ,solid gf mix , best i have ever had
i run a small bed and breakfast and bought this product so i could prepare recipes for my guests that have a gluten allergy and they love it there are many recipes on the box and even more on their website quick easy inexpensive what more could anyone ask for ,great for those with , great for gluten free

you will not miss your old waffle pancake mix when using this wonderful product i mix it with oatmeal in most cases and it makes wonderful waffles pretty easy to give up gluten with this mix ,love my bisquick from amazon , great product
it is good i prefer the taste of baking mixes from scratch but for store bought it is pretty good much cheaper in local grocery stores under per box at my local stores in area ,bisquick , not as good as it is
due to health issues my husband is newly required to eat a gluten free diet he as if he was on death row finding this product has help immensely i can make him pancakes with fresh fruit and he does not feel he is being also my neighbor was with a similar i shared one of the boxes with her and she is now a fan a href http www amazon com gp product b dk bisquick pancake and baking mix gluten free ounce boxes pack of a ,gluten free is not always taste free , great for gluten free
i have only had this once as banana pancakes so i am not sure how it tastes without fruit but it was the best pancake i have had in a long time thank you for making a gluten free bisquick i will try biscuits with it next ,best gf pancake mix , great product
we use gluten free bisquick to make coated baked chicken waffles pancakes biscuits chicken pot pie there are many recipes available to make quick easy meals we really like it everyone can eat it instead of just making a gluten free meal for the one person who is gluten free reasonably priced for gluten free ,great choice for those who are gluten free , great for gluten free
my daughter has been gf for about years now we have discovered that if the main ingredient is rice flour it usually is not any good it is usually grainy this is not the case with this product it makes fantastic pancakes the rest of the family would eat them she did not like the biscuits so we will not make those again we used it to make corn dogs and the entire family and a friend ate them no one even noticed everyone loved them br br amazon has since taken this off of the subscribe and save i am so mad i hope they put it back on soon ,did not think it would be good but it is great , not as good as i be
i really love this product i think it is a great overall flour replacement in your kitchen but i just felt the size was a bit small i would have really loved to see the box be larger i think there are three cups total in the box overall the product is amazing though everything i have made with it has come out wonderfully and all of the recipes online via bisquick website are easy to follow and come out very good i would highly recommend this product to anyone my favorite things to make are the biscuits i add a little cheddar to them to make them oh so good and the apple pie which is more like a coffee cake but good either way give it a shot if you are gf ,wonderful item wish there was more , great for
finally a great and easy gf option for pancakes waffles biscuits etc from bisquick both of my kids have celiac and absolutley love this stuff wish the container was bigger but we are just happy to have better tasting options for breakfast now thank you thank you thank you cannot taste a difference but the rest of the family uses the cheaper stuff ,stars for taste for gf kids , great for gluten free
thanks to the betty crocker people for this gf option it makes great pancakes and shortcakes for strawberries too my is i wish the box was bigger ,thank you , great product
i was so happy to find this product when it was first released i had used regular bisquick for years before being diagnosed with celiac disease this is just as versatile as the original pancakes biscuits dumplings etc my family is the pancakes they are light and fluffy and have a lovely crispness to the outside br br my only reason for not this stars is the size of the box it is small my family of uses the entire box for morning pancakes the box makes approximately small batches of pancakes we freeze the extra in single servings for breakfasts i would love to see bisquick release a larger box but until then i will continue ordering the pack a href http www amazon com gp product b dk bisquick pancake and baking mix gluten free ounce boxes pack of a ,simple versatile , a great product
i really love this mix as the pancakes are so soft and fluffy could not tell that they were gluten free i also made carrot muffins with it and they turned out good ,love them , great gluten free pancakes
i grew up eating bisquik so finding a gluten free version of the baking mix was wonderful however a ounce box only makes two batches of pancakes i would love it if the gf bisquik could be made in a box size like the conventional bisquik especially since my family eats up the pancakes this makes even more than the regular ones ,excellent but the box is so small , great product
due to my kid food allergies i had to substitute eggs with ground flax with water and cups instead of one of rice milk and some olive oil made great tasty pancakes ,great pancake mix , great product
i do a lot of from scratch gluten free cooking but there is nothing that can replace bisquick from the ease of morning pancakes to using it in other in place of other mixes there is simply nothing that i cannot do with this little box ,gluten free must have , gluten free bisquick
i was really surprised when i tried this product because i found it to be a really light fluffy batter so do not think gluten free means flavorless this bisquick pancake mix will have you building up of fluffy pancakes for your family it is so nice that these are healthier for you diabetic friendly and still manage to taste great too ,bisquick gluten free pancake mix is light healthier breakfast , great for gluten free
this gluten free milk free product is awesome i am able to use almond milk in it instead of regular milk it is great to have such a delicious easy breakfast that does not make my stomach hurt ,gluten free is delicious , great for gluten free
i am new to trying gf and most of the substitution products i have tried so far are okay but do not taste quite right br this was the exception the pancakes i made with the gf bisquick were light and smooth and delicious i could not tell a difference unless maybe they were a bit better a larger box would be better but the product itself is wonderful br highly recommended ,delicious , great product
we found out last week that my son has multiple allergies including milk soy wheat tree nuts oranges tomatoes corn thus corn syrup and starch we are in the process of trying to find ways to make what he likes to eat and still avoid ingredients br br does anyone have a list of all ingredients before i spend on this product br thanks ,ingredients , great product
gluten free goes mainstream with the addition of gluten free bisquick br general mills does a good job making the gluten free version of their famous brand br br are you gluten free do you know someone that is an million americans are affected by gluten the protein found in wheat barley and rye grains and most do not even know it gluten is a for many especially those with celiac disease autism diabetes multiple crohn disease and a host of other gluten intolerant and gluten sensitivity issues br it is quite challenging for those following a gluten free diet to find and afford products that are gluten free wheat is one of the most prevalent ingredients in the american diet br find the best tasting gluten free foods at exclusively we have been serving the gluten free community for over years ,gluten free bisquick great tasting pancake mix , gluten free bisquick

hubby had to switch to gluten free because of gluten intolerance so we tried this and made pancakes they were great and had sort of a corn bread texture to it fyi i made cobbler from an regular bisquick recipe not gluten free and the measurements do not transfer the are different with the gluten free mix so make sure you have the right recipe for what you are making ,best all gluten free mix i have tried , gluten free bisquick
my family loves bisquick pancakes my kids did not notice the difference from this product and regular pancakes the only problem is the price i will try this week price seems more reasonable ,fantastic pancakes , great product
i am going gluten free to test if i am sensitive to it it is a good diet to be on anyway br br this was very tasty in a pancake it was light and fluffy you do need to use a little more butter than usual but that makes it even better they fried up with uniform color and had a nice little brown edge letting me know they were done ,makes a nice , great product
it was worth the wait gluten free bisquick is just like the real thing everything tastes the way you remember it so make dumplings pancakes or cheddar biscuits they are all as good as they can be ,just like the real thing , great gluten free pancakes
i have missed bisquick since i became gluten free and am so happy to see they have gone gluten free i have only made pancakes so far but they are wonderful ,happy there is a gluten free bisquick , great gluten free pancakes
it was wonderful we made chicken nuggets it was light and coated the chicken very nicely br br i highly encourage you to purchase this taste pretty much like regular bisquick has many uses flour gravy pancakes excellent way to stretch your dollar ,very light and , great for
it tough to find good gluten free baking mixes but this one is smooth unlike some that are gritty and makes just as easily as regular bisquick it tastes just as good too ,almost like pancakes , gluten free bisquick
i am so happy that bisquick came out with a gluten free version we have tried so many other brands of pancake and waffle mix and hands down bisquick is the best we just made waffles this morning and both my husband and i were floored at how good they were the outside was crisp and the inside was soft with that said it is not that great for pancakes or ,we love it , great for gluten free
my mom impossible veggie pie was a staple in our house especially once i became a vegetarian as a teen as an adult i served it regularly to my family ten years ago when my celiac was diagnosed it was bye bye veggie pie i do try to eat less processed foods but i really did when i heard about the gf bisquick we had impossible broccoli pie last night for the first time in a and it was wonderful the mix is just as easy to use as the non gf alternative and produces the same results no crumbles how often do you see that in a gf product i bought a box at the grocer to test then went directly to subscribe save here this will be a staple in my gf kitchen ,just like the old bisquick only i can eat it , best ever
i have tried a few other mixes for pancakes and they have been awful but this one is really good i should buy stock in the co because people will be buying this product i am sure ,really good mix , great product
i made cheddar biscuits with this and they came out a little dry the first time but i adjusted the recipe and they were amazing i just added a little more milk and another egg we have chickens that lay very small eggs so of our eggs is like large store bought ones ,delicious , great taste
this is an excellent product and i use it just like i used to the regular bisquick product it works well with any recipe that calls for flour and ,great baking , great product
this is a blessing to those of us who are gf there are so many things we can make again now that we have bisquick not to mention that pancakes finally taste like pancakes again how nice to be able to have a biscuit with dinner again since gf products are so expensive the best place to get it is at amazon on the automatic shipment plan it is great ,a real gift to those of us who are gf , great product
as tasty as the regular gluten product only drawback is that you do not get a lot of mix for your money half of the box is needed to make their pancake recipe on a good note it is nice to have options by far though this was the best pancake mix i have tried and i tried a lot ,delicious pancakes , great for the price
this makes the best waffles that i have had in years i will be glad to see more in grocery stores in our area ,bisquick gluten free , best ever
a great way to make cheese biscuits for the celiac i serve to guests and they cannot believe that my husband can eat them as they are sooooo good who says gluten free has to taste bad ,makes wonderful red cheese biscuits , great for
i m the member of my family who needs to avoid wheat products br i like this even more than the regular bisquick mix when i make pancakes br its taste is closer to that of my from scratch wheat flour pancakes br other members of my family have not tried it yet and i have not used it in a pizza crust or biscuits ,just about perfect for pancakes , great for gluten free
we love the new gluten free bisquick i used to for cheddar biscuits mostly until we found out that we had a milk protein intolerance now we are using this to make so many more recipes because it is dairy free and from what i can tell allergen free the only thing i would like better general mills if you are i know i am not the only one that wants this is if it came in bulk packaging just put the gf bisquick in a larger box like the regular bisquick and then sell in a or pack just mark that this review was helpful if you agree and maybe gm will listen love this order now ,great gluten free dairy free option to make lots of yummy food , great product
i usually make my own gluten free stuff from scratch and i love it but the days when i feel lazy i feel like using a mix and this one has to be the best one yet their mix tastes closely like the real wheat thing i have made the pancakes waffles oven baked chicken and strawberry shortcakes absolutely delicious ,great , great for gluten free
our family has been wheat free for years and gluten free for so we have tried just about every mix out there i just found that bisquick has a gf mix while in the grocery store and decided to give it a try this is definitely the best mix that we have ever tasted smooth not grainy i do not know that side by side with regular wheat pancakes that you would notice the difference ,best tasting that we have ever had gluten free bisquick , delicious
gluten free recipes for this mix can be found on the betty crocker website they will not allow me to post the link here sorry br br update fun tip about this and other gluten free mixes my mom figured out that when you are mixing together your ingredients and you are using one that calls for milk that if you mix together only the base mix and the milk and let it set for about minutes before continuing with your recipe and adding other ingredients the end result is much fluffier and tastier this would be much like making tapioca pudding you have to let the milk and tapioca soak to the tapioca before moving on so i think that type of reaction is what is happening here with the bisquick mix yay for mom br br hope that helps you with your purchasing decision br thanks for reading ,one of the greatest gluten free products i have found , gluten free bisquick
rice flour sugar leavening baking soda sodium aluminum phosphate phosphate modified potato starch salt xanthan gum may include soy ingredients ,ingredients were not anywhere i could , great product
i have been gf for the past year and have tried all sorts of flour alternatives this one is certainly the best and the best part about it is you can substitute it for any creation that calls for original bisquick the best so far is the waffles that you can make following the directions on the back i will be ordering again my only complaint is that the boxes are small compared to the other boxes of bisquick available on the shelves ,finally a tasty gf baking mix , great product
this is excellent this is the best gf mix i have yet to try in over five years of trying it all it is not grainy none of that rice grainy thing going on at all the texture of everything i have used it for has been excellent this is a winner the price is a bummer but the product is amazing ,oh my , great product
i bought this product that it would be worth the money and quickly came to love it i made gf biscuits and gravy for my family and we did not mention that it was all gluten free everyone loved the biscuits they did not fall apart at all like a lot of other brands do i used butter flavored shortening and i think it made the biscuits even more delicious if you have not tried it yet try it now i now buy a box a week amazon has a much better price than i can find in most stores in vegas ,just like i regular bisquick , not as good as it is
overall this mix is okay but the sugar content is very very high you can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely for pancakes or waffles this is fine but for savory this is not acceptable sausage balls and biscuits all come out almost inedible this mix is also oddly gritty the grit is very fine but still makes my teeth want to curl i recommend pamela baking and pancake mix as it is smoother and much more versatile because it is not as sweet a good cook knows you can always add more of something but you cannot take it out if you have added too much br br that being said if you are traveling and this is the only mix they have it is better than nothing ,way too sweet , great product
i was so excited to get this and try it unfortunately i am not impressed br br for starters the value is terrible you get cups of mix per box that is enough to make batch of pancakes and batch of biscuits or batches of pancakes whatever for almost a box that is not worth it to me especially when the end result is mediocre at best for the biscuits i made cheddar biscuits and not even the bread loving toddler would eat them the pancakes were okay if i used twice as much real maple syrup as i normally do br br the pro br the biscuits did puff up nicely that is the only pro i have ,not impressed , not as good as the best
best gluten free mix i have tried of the recipes on the box i can vouch for the pancakes and the waffles the biscuits were edible if not enjoyable the pancakes and waffles also freeze well i also recommend betty crocker recipe collection magazine for extra recipes to try with or without this mix from the magazine i have thus far made the chicken and dumplings the dumplings a bit too easily but are still good and the fruit swirl coffee cake i used a full can of pie filling per x i used apple and lemon pie i thought the cake tasted rather like a cobbler or dry pastry the mix is quick it is easy it tastes good and it is versatile and hey although the packaging of the mix into the little boxes is a bit of a pain it does serve to keep the mix fresh ,gluten free with good taste , gluten free bisquick
my daughter was diagnosed with celiac about years ago and has gone without pancakes ever since until i happened to come across this at the grocery store really was not expecting good results but it is very good the non celiac members of the family even prefer the gf version to the regular try it ,yummy , not as good as it is
we have tried so many gluten free products and this one was by far the best i have made pancakes waffles biscuits and the chicken recipe for the whole family with this and they can not tell the difference pamela is a good mix too but this one is much better it is expensive but when you have got a loved one who is gluten intolerant you are just thankful to have options for them i can find it at some of my grocery stores but not all you just have to check and see who carries it and then try a box it is worth it ,love this , gluten free bisquick
i have been using g f products for the past years and it is good to see more main stream companies getting the the product works the pancakes and waffles have come out beautifully ,name , great product
we cant say about the gluten free bisquick my husband and all three kids are allergic to wheat and we are on a gluten free diet in our house i have tried every product out there to make pancakes waffles biscuits and even chicken fingers and was so pleasantly suprised that this little box does it all and does it all wonderful pancakes are wonderful waffles are great chicken fingers are the best ive made and the biscuits are delish cant ask for anything better i only wish you could buy it bigger box and it was a little cheaper but we are a huge fan ,gluten free for best mix tried , great for gluten free
this bisquick gluten free mix is amazing i have not had a biscuit or banana bread in over a year and now i just cannot stop making things br i just made banana bread for the rd time with this mix and my family loves it i use it for everything i am so pleased i made a cherry pie cheddar biscuits i have been br using my old bisquick recipes from ages ago and it is working fine i am so thankful for amazon and their items i sure keep the ups guy br busy ,i cannot baking , great for pancakes
everything absolutely precisely to get a good outcome of course you cannot roll this dough out like traditional dough it has to be dropped onto the baking sheet in spoonfuls i have found that if i do not make it too sticky i can gently form the balls in my hands to give a more regular shape to my scones and biscuits i have also used it for making deep dish chicken pie and pizza be sure you press it nice and thin in the pan i use a to press it so that it does not stick bisquick mix is made by the betty crocker company and this along with the betty crocker cakes and brownie mixes allows me to indulge in delicious baked goods again i have bisquick mix on subscribe and save which makes it very affordable and makes sure that i do not ever run out ,best gluten free mix ever , a great for gluten free
i absolutely love this product being able to have pancakes was my original goal however i made the pizza with it was absolutely thrilled about the pizza br these are small boxes makes two pizzas per box but i would highly recommend i am reordering a pack of three now ,best pizza i have been gluten free , great product
wow thank you bisquick for coming up with a gluten free product i tried it and it works wonderfully so far i have used for waffles recipe on the box which were excellent and a baked chicken and spike recipe which was also wonderful anyone needing gluten free products will like this ,gluten free bisquick , great product
after my husband enthusiastic reaction to the free bisquick biscuits i an old bisquick recipe and used its recipe to make an impossible cherry pie he loved it next i will try the impossible pecan pie this is the first gluten free product that my husband really likes i will buy again although i would like to find it packaged sold less than on amazon ,a great solution , great for gluten free
i like the ease of this mix i have not tried anything but pancakes they were great i did add cottage cheese to my mix to add protein which made them less fluffy but not less tasty i cannot wait to try this mix for chicken i really miss fried chicken ,great pancakes , great product
can as be used to make cookies even egg free i just used the mix enough apple sauce to make a batter some coconut butter and added vanilla and cinnamon and baked turned out soft delicious cookies with only minutes from box to the oven however even carries this for about one dollar per box less than here ,fantastic but over priced , good but not great
this is really a great product works and tastes just like the gluten product our son is a celiac and we have tried a lot of products we rate this brand one of the best ,excellent product , great product
it was recently suggested to me i try going gluten free to battle an disorder i bought the gluten free bisquick hoping the pancakes would at least be edible the bisquick has far my expectations the pancakes are light fluffy and delicious i definitely recommend this product ,great pancakes , gluten free bisquick
i was so excited when bisquick came out with the gluten free version but i was frustrated with the length of time it took for me to get a hold of some i did finally order some through amazon and today i made pancakes using the mix due a milk allergy i made them with soy milk the original flavor and i added a little double strength vanilla they were fantastic and my family and guests gobbled them up i will definitely make them again and try some of the other recipes a href http www amazon com gp product b dk bisquick pancake and baking mix gluten free ounce boxes pack of a ,gluten free bisquick pancakes , great for gluten free
we just bought this the other day because for about years we have found that biscuits are a very hard wheat gluten free item to make i love it i even went further and put holes in the middle of the biscuit dough flattened them a bit and then fried them in a bit of oil sprinkled with sugar and had my year old feels like he is getting a treat ,love me some gluten free bisquick , gluten free bisquick
not gritty like a lot of gf mixes i make the whole box at once and keep them in the fridge pop em in the toaster oven in the morning ,best gf pancakes , not as good as it
second ingredient is sugar need i say more make your own mix it is super easy ,sugar sugar sugar , best ever
i made pancakes and biscuits with this mix and found them to be mediocre at best i really tried to like this product but the taste is just so far off for me i wanted a break from making things from scratch but this just was not worth it ,it just does not taste that good , great product
i ran out of pamela mix and bought this in a regular grocery store because it was all they had i followed the pancake recipe on the back as a person with celiac who has tried many things i knew when i saw the fine mix it was not going to be good the batter is pasty looking the pancakes were too dense and slightly off the end product was pretty bland you will be much better off with pamela mix pamela can be served to a gluten eater i cannot say the same for this product ,pancakes , not as good as it is
the rice flour in it is a crude gritty grade cheap if you have ever used thai rice flour a href http www amazon com gp product b thai rice flour oz a you know that rice flour does not need to be this gritty br br i tried for the grit by using bisquick gluten free to make cakes since the is sort of gritty but sadly after you chew you are still left with this unpleasant grit like fine sand in your mouth ,for no , great for the price
i made the waffles and was not impressed br definitely not worth the expense br br it only redeeming quality was that i seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chops br i would rather have saved my money and made up a flour mix from scratch ,not impressed , not as good as it is
i will first say that i have only tried making pancakes with gf bisquick my family experience with these pancakes however was very disappointing and i will not be trying any other recipe i have tried betty crocker gf brownies and loved them so when i decided to spend a little extra and try gf bisquick i was greatly let down by the result we could not even finish them we just threw them out if you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products i recommend trying pamela pancake mix otherwise if you are looking for great gf pancakes look elsewhere gf bisquick is not worth it in our opinion ,very disappointing pancakes , great for gluten free
i wish some of these companies would say whether the rice is white or brown rice i try very hard to just eat the whole grain version of any grain as they are more nutrient dense plus lower glycemic i have not tried this yet but if it was listed as brown rice flour i would have put it in my cart ,white or brown rice flour it big time , great product
my personal preference is to stay clear of this i did not like the smell or taste i was attempting to make pizza crust for the first time on my second attempt it came out better but i did not like the taste of it if i at least liked the taste i would buy again and make my crust very thin ,not a fan , not as good as it is
i bought these for pancakes and i have not used it to make any other recipes so i cannot speak for how it makes biscuits or any other item but for pancakes it is a no go they have a hint of pancake flavor with lots of butter syrup but i do not like my pancakes in fattening syrup so these pancakes are not for me moving on to other mixes ,good pancakes do not need syrup these need syrup , great for the price
the only complaint i have about the product is the price and i wish it were organic as well other than that it is a great versatile mix i have used it for pancakes and cherry cobbler ,great versatile gluten free mix , great product
just in case you do not know these are about a box at the store so anything more than for a pack is not worth it this is a great product though that what the stars are for the pancakes pizza dough are great i make them all the time ,is too much , not as good as it is
this product is so useful in a gluten free diet the price amazon com makes it all a great buy ,gf bisquick , gluten free bisquick
in the summer my doctor suspected i had a gluten sensitivity she wanted me to start making changes from packaged food and think about cutting out gluten after a bad few months i did some research and found this bisquick i have only made one thing so far garlic cheese biscuits they were very tasty and had no strange texture or flavor they had a more texture than a crumbly biscuits but i was the recipe so maybe that was why i on a biscuit hours out of the oven and it was still as soft and tasty i cannot wait to try pancakes and coffee cake the only draw back is how small the box is for the price i will limit the use to once a week or so for a treat ,be a life saver , great product
this is one of the best gluten free mix on the market it makes fluffy pancakes and light cornbread also it is a great price i have had different mixes on the market in all price and this is the best ,wonderful , great gluten free bisquick
i purchased this while out of town we used it a couple of times but never for biscuits i did make pancakes out of it and they were pretty good always use milk and butter br br they are a bit heavy and have a slight slimy sense to them but are significantly better than a lot of stuff out there i did also use it to thicken some gravy and it was fabulous for that i used it for breading for chicken nuggets as well and it was good i would like to try this again for pancakes and make some biscuits before i make a final decision on it ,really good product but not as good as real , not as good as it is
when i saw the ingredients on this box i knew it would be a disappointment it would be much better and pretty easy just to make your own mix also there are plenty of other quality mixes out there like pamela and bob red mill this will be a huge disappointment to you so do not waste your money ,better out there , not as good as it is
gluten free dairy free technically the dry mix is gf df but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk technically i can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then i could already do this with so many other mixes i have found that mixes that request eggs and or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes the best gf df mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and or oil or other non dairy ingredients in this case i will return to my old favorite mixes by the cravings place these are truely for a gf df lifestyle that said if you are not df then perhaps this is a fine choice it would have been better to have a print picture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great df option ,disappointed this is gluten free but not dairy free , good for a great product
these pancakes are gross they are pale and do not taste like pancakes i bought these based on the reviews because the maple grove farms pancakes were out of stock that week i expected a lot more from bisquick i mean when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat if you leave them in a little longer to get some color they just get hard and taste worse i hate wasting food so i forced myself to finish the boxes but i dont think i will buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock the only reason i gave these stars is because they are gluten free other than that they are awful i am so glad i have got my maple back this week and that these are out of my pantry ,these are , not as good as i be
was awful the sight of this in my pan made me sick smells like potato potato starch would not brown my child the entire time as i complained because i was so hungry and thought i could have a late night pancake totally not the case yes i am a gf i tossed the box ,yuck , not as good as it is
pure toxic garbage eat poison if you want to toxic go ahead and buy this junk and feed yourself poison look at all the high ratings apparently people love eating toxic not harmful would you eat sodium mercury phosphate enjoy your ,go and eat aluminum , great product
a great idea that falls short bisquick gluten free still uses an aluminum based baking powder that is toxic to humans aluminum in our bodies and has been found in quantities unacceptable in individuals the company refuses to to customer concerning this i cannot give this to my family until the baking powder formula has been changed ,bisquick not aluminum free , gluten free bisquick
i actually was delighted to find this product and my family and i loved the recipes made with it however it has sugar as the nd ingredient and worse it has aluminum in it why would i intentionally feed my family something toxic when i am trying to avoid gluten to keep healthy i sure wish those companies who jump on the gf would keep health in the my kids bowel movements are gluten free too but i would not serve it to them for breakfast just ,a disappointment , not as good as it is
our family has tried just about every gluten free pancake mix on the market bisquick is one of the best two members of our family have celiac disease and three of us don t but we all love this mix for our tradition of saturday morning pancakes the only other gluten free pancake mix we like even better is a href http www amazon com gp product b xp r i gluten free pancake mix case of a it is not always available on amazon but when it is we try to stock up is definitely worth trying their other products are great too otherwise it is bisquick or for our family br br the only con i can think of is the price at per pound this mix is expensive if you agree mark this review as helpful maybe the good folks at betty crocker will take notice ,one of the best , a great product
i bought this on a whim because i was craving strawberry shortcake wow the biscuits can be a bit crumbly but the texture is not the taste was great i use this for sweet and regular biscuits br br we also use this for pancakes and they are almost from regular pancakes i add vanilla a touch of brown sugar and cinnamon for a treat yum br br tip i have found that most gluten free bread products work better if you let the batter sit for about minutes after mixing the dry and wet ingredients it seems to the batter which makes the resulting stuff lighter and more moist ,almost as good as non gf , not as good as i be
i love this mix my favorite of any i have tried the only reason i it at is because this is not a deal i can get boxes at walmart for less than dollars but i have heard of some places seriously over pricing it in other states so ,love this , great product
i have used bisquick forever and now that i have celiacs i use the gf bisquick and i love it there is little to no difference at all between the two i have made biscuits pot pie and pancakes and they are all awesome i find most all other brands have an after taste and bisquick doesn t even my daughter who does not have a problem with gluten loves it and thinks its better than regular bisquick and she is only i will buy this product all the time its my baking mix ,love it , great product
oil in gluten free bisquick you can easily stir up an equivalent make pounds or more at a time with very little effort and it will keep for several months br br or if you want a real bisquick substitutes org has a recipe on the site for a cup for cup substitute for bisquick that does use shortening and non fat dry milk powder or you can use buttermilk powder or even dairy free powder it makes cups at a time stores well and you do not have to use their gluten free flour you can use any gluten free flour replacement you want like rice flour and potato starch from your local asian store mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum about teaspoon for every two cups br br to find the recipe do a google search of bisquick substitute master mix br br on betty crocker ,a , a good for a
when i first found out that my year old i had to go gluten free i was a little worried about how she would handle it gf bisquick has made it a lot easier i have been able to make her favorite foods such as chicken fingers corn dogs pizza and chinese sweet and sour chicken with this mix pancakes are also a big hit in our house they have quick and easy recipes on the box for the chinese i take their chicken finger recipe and cute the pieces of chicken into bite size pieces and bake according to the recipe cook up some rice and just use a gf sweet and sour sauce a quick simple easy meal that tastes wonderful ,life saver , great for
having recently been placed on a gluten free i felt i needed some quick and easy help to get me started it works great but is way too expensive for what it is there were just over three cups of bisquick in the box when i read the ingredients i realized i could quickly mix up my own quick bread flour and keep it in the fridge i am glad i tried this item because it taught me that i could do just as well on my own and save a great deal of money ,great taste but expensive , great product
this mix is great for biscuits and homemade chicken nuggets but in our house that is all we have been for years and yes i have a house hold with a husband and kids and we make a lot of gf stuff for everyone we love the pamela baking mix for pancakes waffles and and their flour blend the ultimate best out of them all for bread and as a sub for regular wheat flour recipes but i will buy this mix and yes i do agree it is awfully expensive for those three things i have mentioned and in a gf household usually you find that having a few different blends for different products is just the best thing to do for the best taste not one flour does the best with everything ,great for a things , great product
i regularly purchase this item in the bulk and loved it because it was also dairy free br however my last purchase was disappointing after opening a brand new package i noticed a black thing in the mix carefully removed to find out it was a dead flour i the mix and found more dead bugs br br this is the second time i writing this review amazon did not my first review thank you amazon br i will not be purchasing this item again ,beware , not as good as it is
i have been gluten free since and this is i think the worst tasting gf mix i have come across i have found all to have their own pros and cons but this one have very little to brag about i appreciate the effort anyone puts into a gf product but i could not buy this one again it was like eating reconstituted potatoes that like pancakes no butter or gravy just dehydrated the only real good thing to speak of was the texture it was light and moist but i would have to seriously alter the recipe to add flavor ,bland bland bland , gluten free bisquick
vary ingredients to achieve better results my best experiment with this product was my scratch cornbread i use gf corn meal and this mix to make a delicious bread thank you bc for this product work on the pricing i would use it more often if i could afford it tired of manufacturers holding gf people because it seems to be the latest diet gf people have to have these products to live br br going gf saved my life and bc now makes products so i can enjoy baked goods again i make my own breads using other products and now biscuits cakes cookies with this and other bc gf products i also use this product when recipes call for small amounts of regular flour it depends on what i am making br br as i am reviewing the product i gave it stars i give the pricing stars ,ok but expensive , great product
see a better value for your food dollars incidentally arrowhead mills products are equally as tasty and easy to prepare but i believe you are getting more product in the bag feeding a family of would be a crap at best with a single box of this product br br if the manufacturer were to the product with more content per box and drop the price i would have given it stars safeway was the first store in san francisco to offer this product and placed it in the center of its baking products now however it has fallen to lowest shelf level with some prices sold by higher end grocers approaching per box forget it at those prices hey it is largely ultra fine white rice flour and super fine sugar br br bisquick would also benefit from a buckwheat gf product in its i would certainly buy it ,excellent product pricey not enough product in the box for a family of , a little too much to my
now if you could just make it sugar free also i know i do not want for much a href http www amazon com gp product b dk bisquick pancake and baking mix gluten free ounce boxes pack of a ,gf please me , great for
sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency and yes they are necessary as for the gum it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac safe baked goods a bit of acting as a replacement for the gluten you will find gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease can you just make your own mix and spend less money sure but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix br br the other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes waffles strawberry shortcakes pizza crust ultimate chicken fingers and oven baked chicken you can find more recipes on their website br br i recommend this product for the taste i do wish that more mix was in the box for the price ,very tasty biscuits , a great product for the price
love this mix for pancakes br many gf products have other ingredients i am allergic to so finding something that tastes great and is convenient is pretty exciting i make a batch of pancakes and freeze individual servings to microwave later br just had the yummy pie for dinner last night recipes can be found on com ,best there is , great product
it is very nice to be able to have biscuits again i can only say they need to make a bigger box we run out way to fast ,bisquick gluten free , good
love this it is so good and makes perfect pancakes love that it is also dairy free my husband who does not have gluten intolerance like i do likes them as well hard to tell a difference between this and the gluten y version br br i love companies that make gluten free versions of their foods ,love this , great for gluten free
we have tried a lot of different gf mixes and when i found this new mix from bisquick i decided to try it i made waffles for my family and even my kids could not tell they were gf they almost taster better than my original wheat recipe no strange texture or after taste ,best mix for waffles , great product
this mix does have that grainy texture found with a lot of rice based gluten free mixes the mix works well when the directions are followed and it is fairly versatile br br i will use the mix i have but i am not sure if this will be a staple in my pantry i am not finding myself reaching for it on a regular basis which is usually a sign that this is not a hit in my household ,an easy solution but , not as good as it is
i cannot say that biscuits made from this mix taste as good as the regular wheat but that said for those of us needing gluten free foods it is not bad either ,pretty good , not as good as
i just recently had to go gluten free and have been disappointed by the gluten free flours and baking mixes i bought this and it is amazing just like the original bisquick although it is cheaper at walmart ,just like the original bisquick , gluten free bisquick
when i discovered my sensitivity to gluten about months ago i was dismayed by most of the horrible gluten free foods on the market i have since found some substitute foods that are acceptable to me bisquick gluten free pancake and baking mix is one of them i use it every sunday to make either pancakes or waffles i recommend this mix whole ,i love this product , great product
i bought this immediately after finding out i could no longer have gluten from everything i was reading it seemed to mix different flours to make anything br br the boxes are small while this mix is okay for making pancakes the biscuits are alright and to use it as a coating chicken fingers is i am glad i bought it when i was first diagnosed it helped ease my transition into gluten free cooking and baking br br now that i know what i am doing i will not buy again it is much cheaper to make my own flour mixes at home and use those to make pancakes biscuits and breaking for chicken fingers and my own mix tastes much better but if you are new to gluten free definetly pick this up it will help with the transition ,i would say just eh , a great product
the absolute best baking product of its kind i have tried almost all gluten free baking products and bisquick gluten free is by far the best a little expensive but worth the money ,great , great product
for those with gluten allergies this is great the shortcakes biscuits pancakes taste much the same as with the regular bisquick my only problem with it is that it comes in such a small size would love for them to box it in larger sizes ,gluten free bisquick , great product
this is a healthy alternative to regular bisquick and works great in any biscuit mix recipe i will surely buy it again ,works for me , great product
was on gf diet for about months used this new product from this old quality company with excellent results still use it for variety br a box goes a long way a little expensive but worth it ,bisquick good , great product
bit when i ate these pancakes because i thought they sucked frankly they are completely bland and have no flavor at all and the texture was reminiscent of paste i do not know if that is gluten free but if so it is probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it after letting the batter stand minutes to thicken up a bit it was more like kindergarten paste but still totally flavorless my year old daughter gobbled them up so that is something then i cried a bit more thinking about the fact that i guess i will never get to teach her how to make a real delicious fluffy wheat pancake but that is a whole other thing br br i m giving it stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken but you could do that more with another gf flour ,paste , gluten free and
this is a great product perfect for the celiac searching for biscuit mix or pancake mix that actually tastes good also great topping for chicken pot pie ,great product , great product
this product is beyond amazing i have been cooking pancakes in assorted ways for four decades and for home use no other product comes close to this bisquick gluten free mix it is superior not only to every gluten free product on the matter it is also superior to every other mix gluten free or not on the market friends and family are constantly amazed and surprised when i serve them breakfast so to everyone and anyone do not make the mistake of this bisquick product w other gluten free products that result in food that tastes like cardboard br last thought thanks to amazon for making it available as a subscription purchase since i can no longer find it in any south florida supermarkets ,the best pancake mix by far , great product
this stuff makes great pancakes and shortcake that i am actually allowed to eat br my doctor tells me i am celiac this was three years ago now i just hope i can continue to find this bisquick ,makes great pancakes , great product
the pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores it is not available in all stores but i have found it conveniently enough for my purposes ,bisquick gf mix , great taste
these are really good i like to make them with a little extra milk so that they are thin i cannot even tell the difference between this and regular pancakes it is worth the price for my family ,good gluten free pancakes , good for you
we have been using pamela for making pancakes and waffles but i saw bisquick and grabbed a box to try it it made the absolute best waffles we would ever had gluten free or not pamela has you separate the egg yolk from the egg white and made making our saturday morning waffles i added two packets of splenda to bisquick batter and everyone including my super picky kid came back for seconds i was a little worried because the batter seemed a bit gritty but they baked up very smooth and fluffy my husband made fried chicken from the mix as well we did not have any left overs of that either br br way to go bisquick ,best ever , great product
i am giving this two stars as my family didnt mind the taste but the texture was so grainy and the fell apart easily i was not a fan of the pancakes at all i believe they really didnt have a good flavor will not be wasting my money on such a tiny package either when you can but a bigger package of regular mix for less not fair to us with allergies in my opinion ,texture , not as good as it is
i love that it is mainstream and that it works like bisquick not all recipes work the same as regular bisquick though so i wish they had more recipes available it does taste more gluten free than some other options out there ,works like bisquick , great product
cup gf bisquick br cup soy or almond milk br cup sugar br cinnamon to taste br br pour over your favorite fruit and bake for for a quick delicious cobbler br br gluten free bisquick is not quite as fluffy and crumbly as the original but it is definitely worth it for the gf crowd ,great for , great for gluten free
love these pancakes were something i missed the most after going on a gluten free diet years ago until now these are fantastic thank you for making them i love amazon mom because i get these shipped monthly thank you ,yummy gluten free dairy free pancakes , great for gluten free
the bisquick gluten free was okay but inferior to the bob red mill and hodgson mill products pancake batter when made according to directions was watery resulting in flat pancakes ,for pancakes , great for gluten free
i find the gluten free bisquick pancake mix to be just as easy to use as the original bisquick and i like the flavor just fine not much different than regular bisquick it is easy to make the pancakes just add milk oil an egg mix and pour on the cooking time seems to be about the same and the consistency of the pancakes is just like regular pancakes i would definitely recommend this mix to anyone needing gluten free products ,just like the bisquick you , gluten free bisquick
i was able to use this gluten free product and make it taste better than any restaurant by bringing the buttermilk to room temperature and the from the whites and adding additional baking powder and baking soda to the recipe i love it served with pure maple syrup brings it out of this world ,gourmet pancakes , gluten free bisquick
my year old son cannot tolerate gluten so i have been on a quest to find a pancake biscuit mix for him that he will actually like i tried a few others and they were horrible i felt so bad for my son and kept looking thank goodness i found bisquick it tastes most like real pancake mix and my son really enjoys it i have made him biscuits too and he is thrilled to eat bread again i highly recommend this mix for anyone who simply cannot eat wheat ,thank goodness for bisquick gluten free , great for gluten free
i have been on gf diet for a month and it is hard to find food that taste good or even close to what i used to eat but when my husband found bisquick gluten free at the store the issue of what to eat for breakfast never came up actually my husband eats the gf pancakes even if he does not need a gluten free diet the pancakes are lighter and very tasty just follow the box directions ,a good surprise , great for gluten free
product has similar taste of wheat pancakes without the gluten even other family members not on gluten free diet like it ,bisquick gluten free , gluten free bisquick
made really great biscuits even my non gf husband enjoyed them my only complaint would be that the packages are not very big i used cups to make a batch of biscuits and i do not think there is even cup left in the package ,makes great biscuits , not as good as it is
after finding out i had a sensitivity to wheat i searched for alternatives i decided to try this mix and make some biscuits wow were they good they sort of reminded me of with a slight flavor they came out more like sandwich rolls rather than flaky biscuits but not quite as big i am thinking of making them super size next time so i can slice them in half and use for my lunches after eating corn tortillas every day i am glad i found something else i can have i also made an oven pancake with the mix and that was very good too i highly recommend it ,great biscuits and pancakes , great product
i tried this today with a recipe from my bisquik cookbook for a chocolate chip cookie recipe they came out great my son who has autism and food issues came back for seconds my year old daughter stated they tasted like regular cookies the recipe was easy but took my whole box of mix they stayed puffy as i like my cookies that way anyway i experimented with one tray and refrigerated it it did not matter other than taking another couple minutes of baking will definitely buy this mix again ,awesome , good for you
nothing gritty and second rate here they are just as good and the only pancake mix we use for the whole family gluten free or not they are that good ,cannot tell the difference from regular pancakes and waffles , great for gluten free
i have never made gluten free items before and i got great reviews from customers for my gluten free coffee cake ,very good reviews , gluten free bisquick
i love this product after ten years of doing without the pancakes and waffles from this product are fantastic i too wish it was packaged in a larger box but as it is i do not mind more shelf space to several boxes ,gluten free bisquick , great product
we have been living gluten free for years now and this mix is the best i have found it makes great waffles ,amazing , great gluten free pancakes
it is hard finding similar products for our gluten free child for things she loved before being diagnosed with celiac disease this is a mix that she loves for pancakes she even made sweet potato biscuits yesterday with it we have found it on sale for per box at our local grocery store less than amazon a few times so we stock up when it is on sale it will be nice when gluten free foods are priced more closely to the wheat mixes i would recommend this for you we will try many more using this product in the future a href http www amazon com gp product b dk bisquick pancake and baking mix gluten free ounce boxes pack of a ,makes great pancakes , great product
my daughter that is and allergic to wheat refuses to follow the diet until i bought this now i make her waffles and freeze them every few days i usually get waffles out of a box they are excellent ,great taste , great product
alittle bit expensive for the product i think that it should be the same price as the non gluten bisquick and otherwise it is good ,for gluten free bisquick , great for
we use gluten free bisquick for many different things biscuits pancakes etc tastes good lets us serve our kids that are gluten free the same thing as the whole family ,great product perfect for gluten free , great for gluten free
i just recently bought gluten free bisquick for the first time it has been wonderful i have to admit that i am addicted to their pancakes they are so light and thick and fluffy unlike homemade gluten free pancakes they are absolutely delicious ,love the pancakes , gluten free bisquick
this product made wonderful pancakes i could not taste the difference between this gluten free version and the original i tried using it to make pizza dough to relative success the texture was a little bit weird but it tasted good ,great for pancakes , great product
so i did not feel the need to try this i finally bought it at a whim when i saw it at my local market and i am happy i did i am a baker at heart and love to spoil my family with homemade and pancakes on the i have adjusted my cooking and baking to primarily gf for the past year now and am happy when i find a gf alternative that cooks tastes like the real thing another plus is that i can buy this at my local market which does not carry too many specialty foods and do not have to make the extra trip to the higher end store br br i made pancakes today and they were a hit with everyone will definitely use it to try other recipes br only downside is the cost and size of box very pricey and very small ,better than expected , great product
this mix made tasty crispy waffles using a standard waffle iron but the whole box only made waffles this would be a five star product for me if i could get more than one family meal out of it for the price ,tasty but pricey , great product
this one so does my husband who is not gluten free i hope that everyone these bisquick products since big brand gluten free bread and pasta products are so rare and so rarely good it was something special for me when these came out if you can imagine waiting a for this you will understand if those of us with celiac disease gluten intolerance keep enjoying them maybe the price will come down though it is not bad now and they will offer bulk deals it will also wake up other manufacturers i would happily order a case or much larger package i can make my own bread but i prefer to use a mix and use my cooking time for main dishes so do not hesitate to try it i cannot imagine being disappointed by this product however i do find it for less at my local grocery store ,just needs boxes , gluten free bisquick
extremely happy with bisquick gluten free i had no idea what to expect and was very pleasantly surprised i always preferred bisquick pancakes over other popular brands through the years i am happy to say that i can eat my favorite brand of pancakes again without any health gluten intolerant my next is to make the roll recipe on the box i wish all manufacturers would take note of the rising gluten problem in this country ,for bisquick , great for gluten free
this mix makes the most delicious pancakes my gluten eating family wanted mine instead of theirs i have also make sausage balls and biscuits for biscuits and gravy with it so good ,best pancakes , great for gluten free
i was amazed to find this on the shelf of my favorite grocer sorry to say cheaper than it is sold here even with subscribe and save first thing i made was my childhood favorite dumplings and they were just like i remembered them to be the whole family was happy with them they were such a big hit i cannot wait to make blueberry muffins this summer i have never been able to duplicate the taste of bisquick with any other gf recipe and no other recipe for blueberry muffins is quite the same in my opinion br br thank you general mills ,finally some good , good for you
of money and in the end these are the best gluten free pancakes i have had br br i am not happy about the lack of fiber and the the flours used but a handful of ground flax seed makes up for that br br i am also happy about a brand that helps you to make biscuits and other things from the same mix other companies sell biscuits and pizza dough as a separate item the customer to spend even more money br br compared to the many other brands these do not have a funny taste or smell from odd flours these are made mostly from rice and potato flours you just feel normal br br i hope they will come out with a whole grain version from brown rice and bean flour br br tip to get the texture use butter instead of oil room temperature butter ,i have tried them all this is the best , a great product
i am a bisquick biscuit lover from way back and i thought the biscuits made per the recipe were a little blah but i think they would be perfect using butter or in place of shortening so i have hope as far as the cobbler goes i made a triple berry using the shortcake recipe on the back which calls for butter rather than shortening as the crust it was amazing br if you are expecting the ease of regular bisquick forget it this is not a just add milk and stir kind of product the biscuits require the addition of egg shortening cutting it in but it is easy and not too messy to mix with your fingers and milk also wish there was more in the box most of the recipes on the back require the use of the whole box ,good , great product
i was so excited to see gluten free bisquick my grandmother and mother both used it i remember their strawberry shortcake so that was the first thing i made i almost cried it was so good i have since made the pancakes yum yum and baked chicken i am a regular at their web site com for its great recipes thank you bisquick ,wow pancake at last , great product
i like this product and will order it online again since it is a much better price than the grocery store i wish the box was a bit bigger but it will do it is plain but it makes a light and fluffy pancake you can add flavor with vanilla extract or blueberries i liked the texture of the biscuit recipe but it came out more like a muffin i am going to make it in a muffin pan next time and put cranberries in it i made my biscuits with butter if you are creative with the use of add ins i think it would make good but not the rising type ,quick and easy , great product
my son just started the gluten free diet and i have tried some foods out there just seeing what he will eat he loved it i could not believe it at first but he kept eating i am really glad that i was able to find something that he loves to eat for breakfast my little girl has to eat it to and she says it taste good i buy it every time i run out cause i love eating it too ,wonderful great tasting , great product
i have always trusted the bisquick name so i decided to buy this product i was thrilled with the pancakes and muffins i was able to make the only thing i have a problem with is the size of the box it is very small like most gf product you pay much more than you would for the non gf ,yum and easy , great product
thank goodness bisquick finally went gluten free i have been years diagnosed with celiac and besides pillsbury rolls pancakes have been few and far between as have good biscuits we have eaten many pancakes since this product came out way to go betty crocker only negative is that this is actually cheaper in my local stores ,pancakes again , great for gluten free
my wife and daughter are celiac but my son and i are not we have been using bob red mill gf pancake mix and it is pretty good but you can tell it is gluten free the pancakes we made today with this bisquick mix were amazing my mother my son and i could barely tell them from the normal wheat version on flavor the texture is a bit different but they are light and fluffy unlike a lot of overly dense gf versions we will definitely be stocking up on this and using it with some of the old stand by regular bisquick recipes to see how it works in them ,amazingly good , great for gluten free
so far i have only had time to make waffles with this new gf bisquick but they were delicious sometimes with gluten free products you have to use other weird ingredients or processes to make them these waffles were super fast easy and seriously delicious cannot wait to make other things ,delicious , gluten free bisquick
going gluten free is not optional for those diagnosed with celiac disease but eating a pizza made with a dough created with this product is optional and definitely not recommended i knew something was when i opened the product and it was the consistency of very fine white beach sand putting my aside i proceeded to make pizza dough as directed on the box needless to say the pizza dough was chewy and tasted very strange i would not this product for pizza dough ,the worst pizza ever , not as good as it is
the product is very good way too expensive and at almost a box to get pancakes or biscuits i was disappointed ,good product too expensive , great product
my family is gluten intolerant and we use this product extensively pancakes biscuits waffles it does not really matter what you need to bake this mix comes through this is my go to mix above bob and all others we have tried try a box follow the instructions for pancakes and tell me they are not awesome go ahead i dare you ,great gf baking mix , great product
i have tried numerous boxed gluten free flours and i never get the consistent results i get from bisquick gf mix it is also more economical than making your own who wants to buy flours just to make a cake and this one never has that strange metallic smell others like bob have i find myself making pancakes biscuits cupcakes again after years of going bread free due to a wheat allergy br br my one complaint is that i cannot seem to find this in any local store i have my fingers that amazon continues to carry this ,and tasty , gluten free bisquick
i have purchased san francisco bay coffee before i have always found that the quality of their coffee is excellent the beans are always well chosen and slow roasted a very high quality coffee at a reasonable price ,great coffee , great coffee
the coffee was good but did not have a strong flavor would not buy this product again nice to try new products and try new flavors ,coffee was good but not a strong flavor , good coffee
i had tried a small batch of the pods for my keurig and fell in love this chaser variety is just about perfect i shall be ordering more beans so i never run out ,great morning cup , great coffee
every where for this coffee found what i thought was a great value on amazon when i bought it there was no image available should have been my first warning sign they had lots of pictures of the oz bags of coffee from the san francisco bay coffee co but i wanted something bigger and this was lbs now there is a picture but if you look closely it is family company coffee who is technically located near the san francisco bay area so if you are in love with san francisco bay coffee company do not buy this coffee but on the upside since i waited till the last minute to buy it i gave it to my parents for christmas anyway explained what happened but they said the coffee was pretty decent so still makes a nice cup of coffee just not san francisco bay coffee company coffee ,not coffee company , not great
these sticks definitely do not look like ones in the picture br they are much thinner and imho not worth the money i should have returned it but instead gave my dog gsd at a time to keep her busy br br i d stick with the or equivalent from another website ,sticks are compared to sticks , not as good as it is
i just received my order of count regular bully sticks and am extremely disappointed br only bulk bully sticks are hand measured for consistent thickness i beg to differ br the regular size is as thickness the product i received is less than in thickness br out of pieces less than five actually measured up to the regular thickness advertised br my blue one piece in less than a minute it usually takes him five minutes br br on the other hand my toy terrier is still working on hers and will not leave leftovers for the big guy to clean up br while i understand that com good causes i will be spending an extra cents per piece and get a much more substantial treat ,not as advertised , not as good as it is
i have two medium sized dogs and these are a real bargain but only keep them busy for about minutes next time i will get the larger size ,great price but the sticks are small , great
i ordered these despite my concerns after reading other reviews re small diameter size absolutely true and i regret making the purchase for the same price i briefly ordered from a different amazon vendor the same and length bully sticks for the same price difference original vendor bully sticks were on average thick this vendor bully sticks are at most thick with most closer to br br what difference does it make br br our dog a slender lb mixed chow would take days to get through a bully stick and would get hours and hours of good gnawing time in on each one these new thin ones she completely in less than mins that makes a huge difference in how fast we go through the bag br br will not order again from this supplier ,small good for small dogs not for our dog , my dog loves these
the thickness is just as described they are not thin as straws like some other reviews had stated my pet chihuahuas love them very much it usually takes them an hour or so to finish chewing so it is a great time for them one negative thing i would complain is the strong smell of the bag though i have to tuck it away in a corner in order not to smell it often when pass by this might not apply to everyone since my nose is a bit more sensitive than most normal people over all i would had given star if it was not for the smell i have to give stars for now ,sticks , not as good as it is
apparently regular size thinner than standard sized my chihuahuas finish these in a matter of minutes when it normally takes them days to consume a thicker bully stick ,too thin , not as good as it is
great on any thing from rice to pasta to burgers i cant wait until the week end for my favorite over easy eggs and this mix more heat than you would expect have tried a couple other brands not the same ,yes i live to eat this , great product
with all natural ingredients and no preservatives all i can say is fantastic there is no expiration date but i would eat this within a week or two faster if it is opened absolutely excellent br br you can freeze these with no loss of quality br br don t order if the weather is hot because they ship it in cool bags with cold packs instead of styrofoam with dry ice my orders usually arrive cool but not cold ,fantastic , not as good as it is
the of these pickles is enough to strip the mind of reason they are brown mushy and flavored with spices that bring to mind the and the on top of that each and every pickled chunk is sweetened with a full tablespoon of pure cane sugar br br no living human being could consume more than one without selling his soul ,days of bad taste in your mouth , not as good as it is
in my opinion these are heads and above any pickle that you normally find at your local grocery store a lot of nice sweet pickle flavor i probably will not buy again off of amazon because of shipping charges but if i ever see them locally i will buy a bunch ,pretty good , good but not great
i gave this as a stocking stuffer to my husband to remind him of our last holiday in beautiful jamaica it has a truly tropical taste that is very unique and yummy ,tasty , great taste
best grapefruit soda on the market cost is good but shipping is expensive i still buy it every now and then for a special occasion ,delicious , delicious
i was looking for holiday sprinkles in bulk and up to find these i have purchased this brand at williams and sonoma before but always in small containers i paid the same amount here for the bulk package i am very happy ,just what i was looking for , not as good as it is
what a steal i make a lot of gingerbread cookies during the holidays large ones over long and i bag them in bags they look like you bought them at a fancy store these decorations are the best and they are so cheap ,i like a when i bought these , not as good as
india tree products are great and you cannot beat the value here at amazon i use these to decorate cakes and cupcakes they will get a workout as the holidays near ,tree is superb , great product
i have used this mix for years for yellow pound cake and everyone seems to love it i am still able to purchase the oz at my local grocery i was going to order this product but saw that it was oz and was afraid it would not go with the old duncan hines pound cake recipe hope these companies realize the damage they are doing to time proven recipes when they their products ,use for pound cake , great product
in the past i was able to make so many different cakes using this cake mix i made rum cakes today thinking i had done something wrong when the first one did not turn out as usual i now realize i did not do anything wrong duncan hines did something wrong by reducing the size of their product i would gladly have paid more for the larger mix now i will never buy another dunkin hines mix how do you think we are ,an old friend , not as good as it is
duncan hines used to be my favorite line of cake mixes i bought them all of the time but now they like betty crocker have their packages of cake mix these new mixes will not work with older recipes that called for the ounce size of cake mix that out a lot of our favorite cakes even a plain cake will be changed it will not bake up as high or as big in the pan duncan hines just lost me as a customer br br pillsbury has not reduced their cake mix sizes at least not yet i will be buying them if they in size i will bake from scratch ,have , not as good as i be
while i think this product is good i am disappointed that they reduced the weight of the product from oz to oz has anyone else noticed how difficult it is to read the type used for the weight the looks very much like an same size box less product ,the weight change , good
i have bought duncan hines yellow cake mix in the past and have made a favorite recipe with it in the past it had ounces pillsbury and betty crocker have the required ounces i bought duncan hines at safeway because it was less expensive than the other brands and after i got home i discovered why i will not buy duncan hines again unless they go back to the ounces or go to ounces for consumer beware and read the number of ounces in the product ,cake miss , great taste
thing you should know is that you get six boxes of cake mix this is enough mix to a very very big sheet cake that would require a very very large or oven you could also prepare a tall layer cake which would kind of look like a miniature version of the in san francisco certainly enough the most delicious yellow cake for a very large number of the special people br br finally a charming aspect is that on the very same page as this product amazon suggests customers who bought this product also bought fresh refills case of s ct obviously the special people getting down with this cake six boxes of cake mix is bound to make a mess in the kitchen and later on there will be cake crumbs on lips and and fingers br br a few fresh could come in handy br br smart ,favorite cake , great product
maybe i got a bad one it is very plain nothing special in flavor i felt like i wasted my time and money i will not buy this flavor again ,very plain , not as good as
thanks for having it sent to me promptly i was very happy to be able to order it online and get it the next couple days ,thanks , great product
i made one for my daughter birthday party and everyone but her died of poisoning still tasted pretty good though ,not recommended , great product
ghirardelli is not the finest chocolate you can buy but it is pretty good and the intense dark assortment is both inexpensive and provides you a few possibilities br br i ve lately taken to unwrapping a and cacao square for each dinner guest and setting them on an individual to serve as an after dinner sampler with red wine or that is been a pretty popular approach a similar approach also works if someone having a bad day sitting them down with a small assortment of intense chocolate is not a bad to feeling a little better br br i do wish that there were the same number of each in the bag that is the only downside of course if you really want the sets of three to serve to guests you will have to go through the task of somehow eating the extras darn ,actually pretty good , not as good as it is
many reports are coming out about how chocolate is actually good for you so eat more this is the perfect chocolate to do that with the varying levels of cocoa are perfect to help adjust your taste buds to eating dark dark chocolate it is not an easy transition for a milk semi sweet kinda gal but this chocolate is affordable and so tasty i also like that i can just have one as they are individually wrapped and choose my ,chocolate is good for you eat more , great taste
chocolate intense dark squares especially now that recommend you have an oz of dark chocolate each day that is over chocolate is a vegetable a friend reminded it a bean br br these chocolates are affordable tasty rich intense silky smooth and just the right size i love to serve them for after dinner the squares are fairly large and individually wrapped it is great to have different amounts of depending on guests tastes dark chocolate is an acquired taste for some of course the darker the chocolate the healthier so you can work your way up to the great to have on hand for the holidays if you are on a diet and want a low calorie chocolate healthy treat having these individually wrapped the temptation i am happy with one square most days br br these are a great non guilty pleasure that are good for your health ,great dark chocolate for or for , great for a great price
i got this for a family member as part of a football themed gift i like that the basket can be reused i have had the pasta before so i know it is good i do not know how the other items taste ,great for fans who have everything , great product
of these candy bars just might seem like but you can always tell yourself that you are going to give them out to company of course the truth is that they are way too good to give away to anybody they can just go get their own br br the good news is that they are shipped so fresh and soft that they will last till you can finish off your stash br br they re awesome ,every bit as good as you , good but not great
this product is shipped so fresh that even if it takes your family months to eat their way through the box the last bit o honey will still be fresher than anything you can buy off the shelf at your local grocer these are the large candy bar sized wrapped in wax paper because they are fresh they are soft like taffy and so a breeze to extract from the wax paper plus have the flavor ever enjoy ,bit o honey you will find , good for you
they are almost gone already and i am about pounds heavier but these candy bars are much fresher than anything in the stores if and when you can find an outlet that carries them yum ,bit o honey , great taste
the bit o honey candy that i ordered took me back to my childhood when i used to buy the product it arrived in a timely manner in good shape and of course it tasted ,the candy tasted good , good
excellent quality and so o o fresh a href http www amazon com gp product b e o bit o honey candy ounce packets pack of a ,fresh , great taste
i was glad i ordered this candy it still taste like it did years ago ,it is still the same , good
i was just going to reorder the bit o honey last me a long time and i enjoy eating it slowly in my mouth just like a kid ,time candy love it , great product
love my taffy br she so br her name is bit o honey br she gives me a kiss br oh what a bliss ,love of , great product
i found the candy to be harder than i had expected it came in bar form and it is rather hard to chew but just as tasty just takes more chewing to enjoy ,my favorite candy but o honey , not as good as it is
my neighbor and i love this candy and it is difficult to find the oz packets in the stores so i just decided to purchase a whole case they were fresh and great tasting ,a bit o honey , great taste
best bit o honey i have ever eaten br i have always bought this product at a local grocery store and it was always hard i figured it was suppose to be that way but after eating the box i bought here i now know better the candy was soft and delicious br i plan to continue buying bit o honey from here ,fresh soft candy , great stuff
this is an excellent candy for those of us who have to limit our chocolate intake each bar is into six pieces which helps with portion control and makes it perfect for sharing my only is that it is sometimes hard to get all the paper off the candy as it is quite sticky ,yummy , great taste
have not had bit o honey since i was a kid and seeing them on amazon made the purchase a no brainer and they were as good as i remember ,just like when i was a , not as good as it
i hate honey but i love bit o honey candy i really do not taste the honey in them i like the bars better than the individually wrapped candies because the shape is easier to eat i like them hard brittle and chewy not soft this is actually cheaper per bar than where i buy them locally ,yum , delicious
while i love bit a honey and do not regret my purchase i did not find them as fresh and soft as the other reviewers they arrived hard and brittle but still taste wonderful if you can eat them without breaking your teeth maybe it is because i bought the bags of individually wrapped bit a honey as opposed to the actual candy bars next time it is the bars ,not so fresh , great taste
dried berries still with texture and the aroma pot roast is so much better with half a dozen berries flattened into the and scooped into the mixture but in ten years trying to find them so now i know to look for it on amazon ,lovely , good
again exactly what i ordered no fuss no muss arrived on time pretty much an ideal transaction only thing that threw me was that i the quantity gallon baggie in the freezer ,what i ordered , not as good as it
berries are find but the package is bad unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor ,get a new , not as good as
the food and drug fda is again consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs also sold as chicken strips or treats may be associated with illness in dogs in the last months fda has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from china these complaints have been reported to fda by dog owners and ,and , my dog loves them

i gave this as a gift and it was a big hit nothing was broken it was gift wrapped paid for this and even came with additional salt samples i was surprised at the amount of salt in each tube more than enough to get numerous meals of use out of each it was well recieved and i would not hesitate to buy again i will say i think the shipping cost was a tad high but the salt was a good deal so it out ,great gift , not as good as it is
i bought this product for a friend but i liked it so much i am keeping it and buying a second one for my friend ,i am buying two , good
i ordered this collection on and it arrived on although it was was very well packaged this did not prevent the usps from to break one of the tubes the seller was contacted by email and a replacement requested as this was a birthday gift and the occasion was only a week away i offered to pay for shipping seller responded immediately stating that a replacement would be shipped asap the replacement tube arrived three days later in good shape my offer to pay additional shipping charges was in summary this product is excellent and the customer service absolutely first rate i highly recommend both the product and the seller ,real customer service , good stuff
i ordered this salt collection for my husband as a christmas gift he absolutely loves it and has used it every night since this is a great gift for anyone who enjoys cooking i will be ordering the second collection for him soon ,excellent gift for any , great taste

of schedule a small wooden salt spoon sample packets of gourmet salts and a reference index card with information about each of the salts were included was and helpful this is a great company with an interesting variety of salts and spices i will definitely make a future purchase and refer the spice lab to others br br update i am disappointed that my email a broken test tube and has gone the first time i used one of the salts i was gentle but a large piece broke off as well as some of the top the tubes should not be so fragile so i sent an email to that affect to the owner despite my initial email about how much i loved the gift and where could i post a positive comment he has not responded with to the breakage good customer service would be to follow up ,first company wonderful , great product
what a wonderful starter kit this is while i am and was familiar with some varieties of exotic sea salts i certainly had not had the opportunity to try this many at one time than chance buying a product that i did not like and being stuck with it this allowed me to give each and everyone a try br br i plan to order at least three more sets for presents this coming year for friends that like me are br br this is an excellent product ,excellent , great product
this product is great and so is the company i had problem with the post office and they were right there to resolve the issue this is a great gift to yourself or to others ,great great great , great product
this is a very neat gift for someone you know that is into cooking and eating it has a wide variety of exotic salt in the collection br br there is a surprising amount of salt in the collection in other words each tube holds about as much salt as would fill a small salt shaker ,unique gift amount of salt , great taste
purchased this as a gift for a couple of salt loving friends it is great and attractive a note to we had one of the salt arrive empty and it says no returns if you contact the seller directly they will work with you the seller send me a replacement very quickly and even sent a cool little salt dish along with it will definitely get this set for others maybe even me in the future ,really great product , great taste
of the damaged area they sent me a new block and two little spoons to replace the one that was missing from my original order the replacement block arrived yesterday in plenty of time for my trip to visit my son and daughter in law br br in i should have contacted the spice lab before i posted the review so they could have had time to resolve the problem i had jumped to the conclusion that i would need to return the item in order to get a replacement which was not the case br br since it is a gift i cannot speak to the quality of the salt but i can say that the block is very sturdy and attractive and the little spoon is a charming addition br br i greatly appreciate the of at the spice lab and i would happily buy from them again ,review , not as good as i be
i got these salts for my boyfriend who loves to cook and love his salt the stand they come in is wooden and sturdy much nicer than i expected the salts themselves are phenomenal and i have already bought the nd set ,love this , great taste
i bought this as a gift for a friend who likes exotic salts and it was a hit with him it was well packaged with no breakage some of the reviews have mentioned that they received broken containers the wooden holder is nice but not all that permanent i would recommend this for someone who d like to sample various kinds of salt and does not mind paying a high price the reason i gave it four and not five stars was the price ,pricey but nice selection of , not as good as it is
four of the glass arrived broken the product is apparently not able to be returned so i just wasted dollars ,of arrived broken , not as good as
one of the was broken when we received this product but you cannot return the product or get a refund what a rip off ,high do not buy , not as good as

i saw these in our local one day and decided i had to give them a try i was only looking for something that might be a better for me choice to satisfy my sweet tooth i had no idea how much i would like these and have to have more i got one bag of the raspberry and one bag of the maple and i love them both i am thrilled to see that they are a much healthier alternative than most baked goods especially than the ones i normally choose i am not someone who is health or tends to read labels before buying an item i love these twists and am looking to buy them in a larger quantity so i can enjoy them more often they are light and flaky and satisfying and good a must for me ,who this was a great choice , not as good as you

at first i was concerned about ordering babka online but i kinda missed this one as i tasted it the only thing i could say was wow i will order this again for sure ,absolutely delicious , great product
wonderfully cinnamon y i will definitely be ordering it again and heated up with a tiny bit of butter on it put it over the top in taste ,fantastic , great product
looking forward to receiving this product and when it arrived it was covered in walnuts unfortunately tree nuts are an issue and i wish that there was information about nuts on the items listing i will bring it to work for the staff to enjoy br br addendum staff loved the babka picture of product now shows nuts on top prior listing did not stars for the babka and stars for the lack of ingredient list at least major allergens ,item in needs to have , not as good as it is
while the flavor and quality of this chili is great the ounce can is mostly liquid the number of servings is listed as but the reality is that it will only serve about unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated i will not be purchasing this again ,chili soup , great taste
love this stuff i add some diced tomatoes and a pound of ground hamburger and this is great i take it to pot a lot ,great chili , great product
you cannot beat the price and taste of this coffee it will always be my first choice to buy my husband brought it home one day because he liked the price and thought the the can looked neat little did we know it would become our new favorite ,full o , great coffee
cannot go wrong with this remember its better coffee a money cannot buy always priced right and in this economy that is not always easy frankly i prefer it over starbucks where one can easily spend the same amount on one cup of coffee ,love it , great coffee
b u r n e d br br i read the other two reviews and did not their warning that is on me br br they are usable but they were certainly burned ,agree with others b u r n e d , good coffee
i cannot believe i wasted almost on this they were burned they were inedible it was so nasty and they took forever to arrive br you should take this product off of your product list worst product i have ever ordered ,disgusting waste of money , great product
i purchased boxes as gifts at per box i spent over and none could be used every piece was broken and could not be used for the sending a gift that is broken and cannot be used is very also the return window is april th which is ridiculous since the was for the first which was on april th at night ,worst purchase ever on amazon not , not as good as it is
they contain no tea leaves in this case the same is true perhaps because it is a white tea which is naturally light the tea itself literally contains dried pomegranate seeds included do you know that taste you get a few moments after you eat a pomegranate seed if you don t try it it is wonderful that initial bite from the tartness followed by sweetness you get or at least i get from a pomegranate is in this tea and it makes sense there is pomegranate seeds in there br br conclusion br br buy this tea i was a little skeptical about my first purchase since i was buying boxes but it was a great choice that i do not in the least bit regret i have bought this for myself and for family with everyone absolutely loving it best i have ever spent and continue to spend ,not too light not too sweet but oh what a wonderful flavor , not a great product
enjoyable tea with a refreshing taste the count pack of an excellent buy compared to store prices ,my tea , great tea
i love this tea i have issues with added flowers and flavorings in other teas and revolution teas tell you exactly whats in it and there are no additives i have been ordering from them ever since my first box of tea i take it to the office and i have a travel container and take it with me to restaurants ,best tea , great tea
this is the first time we bought this tea from amazon we used to get it directly from revolution tea i do not know if that made any difference or if it was just a change in the tea along with the packaging but what used to be my wife favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong almost cheap generic green tea flavor really disappointing especially since we are stuck with six boxes ,tastes different and much than before , great tea
as an steeped pun intended in strong black tea i was not sure about this but revolution white pomegranate tea is absolutely delicious light yet flavorful the low caffeine content makes it ideal for an evening pot of tea and of course iced tea i hesitated to recommend it in case you run out of it ,a in tea , great tea
the flavor is very mild we tried brewing longer and using cooler water temp but the flavor is almost would not purchase again ,out , great taste
trader joe pomegranate white tea is superior to this tea this is very bitter and maybe thats what you get when you brew whole leaves and stems i found it ,very disapointed , great tea
revolution teas are superb smooth and delicate each one has been pleasant comforting and a pure delight i have tried this one the pomegranate as well as ginger peach dragon eye oolong and white pear ,teas are smooth and , good
i purchased this tea for someone who enjoys trader joe white pomegranate tea and unfortunately it was not a good substitute though i have not tried it myself i was told it had a strong floral taste and aroma which to that particular tea drinker was undesirable i am rating stars since this is such a subjective and i have no doubts about this being a high quality product ,tasting tea , not as good as it is
i am going to be pouring it over ice i put my ice cubes in a large glass and pour my hot tea over the ice grab a straw and it is ready to drink br br it also tastes good when i steep bags of the revolution white pomegranate tea with bags of the arizona pomegranate this is my favorite on ice the arizona is a green tea this is my usual pick me upper i want to note that i gave up drinking diet soda in march and has made this concoction my replacement it was a little difficult at first but now that awful stuff is out of my system br br i have not tried this tea hot as i am not a fan of hot tea but i am sure it is just as delicious i subscribe to this and the arizona pomegranate green tea ,makes great iced tea , not as good as it is
get with some other decaf coffees it is a smooth mellow taste even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa i really enjoyed this the grind is listed as extra fine but i did not find it particularly fine myself when i grind my own beans i have a finer grind than this but i still expected a stronger taste from the melitta than i would from other store brands however the melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried we like our coffee strong about cup ground coffee for to cups water using measuring cups this ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the melitta but that is easily the nice thing about the coffee is that even when i made it very strong the smoothness remained i will definitely be trying other types of melitta coffee in the future ,mellow flavor no aftertaste , it is ok
aroma throughout the house almost made it seem like i was in a coffee shop unfortunately it is just decaffeinated and did not give me the jolt i need in the morning br br the packaging caused some problems for me the seal is excessively tight i have never had this problem with starbucks dunkin donuts peet coffee or packs with the melitta it was so tight that when i did open it the bag tore apart and spilled a lot of the ground coffee onto my kitchen top and floor one could argue that this tight seal packs in all the flavor i could argue that if it were easier to open i would not have spilled maybe days worth of coffee grounds onto the floor br br pros light roast excellent aroma nutty and creamy taste br br cons decaf and hard to open pack br br overall ,packaging needs great taste is not my thing , great coffee
melitta rich product is a delicious treat comparable to coffees with a much higher price tag it is a plus that the decaffeinated version does not sacrifice flavour highly recommended ,excellent quality and value , great taste
loaded two servings into a melitta filter i poured two cups of f water through the uniform grind is apparent in that the coffee did not clog as it does with blade ground coffee due to dust i drank the coffee black br br tasting br the smell is of decaf and or instant coffee pretty stale but the decaf process is partly to blame overall i enjoyed it as much as any drip decaf i have had recently there was no biting bitterness i drank two cups black without much of a ache br br pros br tight packaging with little air helps maintain freshness br excellent grind br low bitterness br br cons br not locally roasted br not fresh best by date is a year in advance br br verdict for mail order pre ground decaf this coffee lived up to expectations and was drinkable or stars ,coffee reviews ground decaf , not as good as i like
i love coffee i love coffee a lot and really do not enjoy decaf this decaf is not bitter though tastes smooth and brews up very nicely enjoyable to the last drop ,delicious not bitter , great coffee
this melitta cafe collection riviera sunset blend coffee is so full flavored it is much better than other decafs we have tried and really tastes like regular coffee which is great because enjoy aided coffee the summer so no worries about it keeping us awake all night recommended ,rich flavor , good coffee
teaspoons of coffee for six ounces of water that got my up so i measured out my coffee scoop and it is one tablespoon since i use two heaping scoops that is slightly more than three times as much as suggested on the package following the directions would probably make a watery undrinkable brew br br the coffee has a nice even espresso grind perhaps a bit lighter than a french roast i would have guessed that it was primarily arabica with some but melitta states that it is an all arabica blend from central and south america it is decaffeinated through the chemical free swiss water process which is the only acceptable way to decaffeinate as far as i am concerned br br also note the cute vintage travel poster style label and the clever name because it is decaffeinated it is perfect to drink while watching the sunset ,a good cup of decaf , good but not great
the same way i normally make my coffee on the strong side the second time i followed the directions exactly both times using filtered water and a quality coffee maker that uses the melitta style cone filter to my taste it was stale and over ground like the flavor was watered out of it and then over roasted and ground extra fine to try and put some flavor back into it comparable in quality to low end bulk coffee the brands of decaf coffee i do like and brew at home dunkin and newman own to name only two are in the same price range and also purchased pre ground but to me taste much smoother and more full flavored this coffee is not one i would make a point to purchase when there are better coffee choices for the same money or cheaper coffee choices for the same quality ,nothing special , great coffee
the price is great but i just did not like the taste of this coffee i am pretty picky about coffee and love to drink strong this one produce very acidic coffee when made strong but if you make it thin then it tastes okay with just slight acidic after taste how you would like this coffee is really depending on your personal taste of coffee but if you are like me drink coffee strong or dislike acidic after taste that lasts while then this is not for you ,slightly acidic not for me , not as good as i like
the main reason i drink decaf is to have the pleasure of coffee to go with dessert in the evening my caffeinated coffee is drunk in the morning only one cup so this coffee is pretty good with evening dessert since i will not get up flavor is good packaged well easy to brew ,pretty good to go with dessert , good coffee
an excellent bold medium blend of decaf coffee for a special evening dark enough without being bitter and a perfect compliment for a light desert ,smooth cafe coffee , good coffee
i had never heard of this coffee before but i got a bag and really liked it this melitta cafe riviera sunset decaf is a very good decaf with a good taste and body this stuff is perfect for a late night cup of coffee or for a cup with some dessert its decently priced and i will definitely buy this again ,good decaf , good coffee
i thought this would be a great decaf option but the flavor is a lot milder than expected i use a bit more than the recommended amount to more intense flavor a bit better than instant for late night like me ,decaf option mild flavor , not as good as it is
melitta riviera sunset decaffeinated ground coffee turned out to be a good basic coffee not bitter not burned tasting a well rounded mellow brew that tastes like real coffee i had it this morning with almond milk stevia and a pinch of cinnamon and though i would had a bad night and did not even know if i could handle coffee it was delicious and easy on a morning tummy besides brewing it alone to get a nice decaffeinated coffee for night time drinking especially in the winter we have been mixing it with regular coffee in various blends depending on our caffeine related needs at the time br br the packaging is practical and easy to re close and the grind is good for my automatic coffeemaker i will buy this one again ,a good mellow coffee , not as good as i have
i remembered that melitta was a very fine ground and thought it would likely go well in my coffee maker br br but after having a bag of whole beans and grinding it myself the melitta came up average at best better than maxwell house though ,just cannot fresh ground , not as good as it is
i like this coffee it smells good while brewing and tastes as good as it smells for a decaf coffee it is very good br will definitely buy this at my local store ,very good coffee , good coffee
this stuff tastes great i am not a decaf person but perhaps i am being won over by melitta coffee try it ,delicious and without the , great taste
i love coffee and admit that i am particular when it comes to good coffee i was not expecting much from this coffee and was pleasantly surprised to discover it was quite good it falls into the likes of starbucks and other shade grown coffee brands deep rich flavor br br though i enjoyed it i am not sure i would purchase this unless it was on sale i do find it a bit overpriced if you do not mind spending the money you will be happy with this coffee otherwise i would suggest purchasing this on sale for a special occasion ,good but pricey , not as good as i have
cone similar to this one a href http www amazon com gp product b q s ready set joe mug a and found that the extra fine grind of the riviera sunset blend an rich deliciously flavor much fresher than conventional by the pot coffee this method also allows me to brew strong coffee for me and a milder version for my hubby br br take time to bloom the grounds first add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds completely and then wait about seconds before brewing for best flavor this goes for any coffee br br melitta riviera sunset decaf blend is recommended by a coffee snob you will love it as is no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor i look forward to ordering more br br update just ordered my first pack through subscribe save great deal for some delicious decaf ,decaf never tasted so good stars , great coffee
strong not bitter good coffee flavor br br for the sake of comparison i most often drink the ground version of a href http www amazon com gp product b eq eight of the clock coffee decaf whole bean ounce bags pack of a right now on amazon melitta is slightly more expensive per ounce though subscribe and save would even it out and melitta brewing instructions call for using a smaller amount of grounds i would expect them to be about the same quality and in my opinion they were this is certainly a coffee i am happy to drink when i want decaf br br one downside is the bag my husband got to it before i did but he reported that it required scissors to get it open the feature on the bag then could not be used so we made the transfer to another sealed container ,good cup of decaf , good but not good
my wife and i both thought this is a nice cup of coffee the bag has a one way on it to keep the air out and arrived virtually flat when brewed in our cuisinart drip coffee maker it has a nice aroma i take mine with cream and sugar and mrs b drinks hers black we both thought it was smooth with no bitterness later it made a nice after dinner coffee when we added our favorite liquor tho i am no coffee snob i can tell a good cup of coffee from a bad one and this one makes the grade ,good coffee , good coffee
this ground decaffeinated coffee makes a fine brew with a rich aroma and flavor it is smooth and satisfying with a full bodied taste my wife and i loved the taste and aroma of this ground coffee for an ideal cup measure one heaping teaspoon full of coffee per cup of hot water you could change the quantity depending on the strength of the coffee you desire i generally drink decaffeinated folgers brand and when i compared the two brands i did not find a great deal of difference in the richness of coffee you may want to consider the price between the two brands before you want to purchase this product ,a fine coffee , good coffee but not a great price
i do not like coffee too much actually i am very particular about coffee and i can say that this is one of my favorites it is so smooth and flavorful the smell is really good and i cannot have enough of it i have gone as far as skipping going to starbucks or dunkin for coffee br the price is decent for this kind of product so i highly recommend it ,excellent smooth flavor , good coffee
de caf so i gave this a try br br while i agree with some other reviewers who have stated that there is a certain different taste about this blend for me it was not a bitter taste but instead a good strong flavor that the strong real coffee taste i enjoy i had a second cup and the flavor grew on me even more and i thought it really is delicious for a decaf br br the aroma is not truly satisfying why does this always happen with decaf but i think many decaf drinkers will be used to that lack br br the package had to be open with scissors this is tightly packed and then i just poured it into a zip for storage in the fridge br br i ll stick with regular coffee but i am sure my de caf loving friends will enjoy this ,delicious , not as good as it
nice smell filled the air finally our coffee was ready and we both sat down to taste this product my husband he loves any coffee that has arabica beans he looked at me and said ummm this is really good my turn i sniffed some more i am a real before anything goes into my body it still smelled pretty good so now for the taste test br br okay it was definitely different than the dunkin donuts coffee that i am use to and love however it had a smooth flavor but a little richer than i like and i did not seem to notice that it was decaf that was a good thing it was flavorful and made a pretty good cup of coffee hubby liked it a lot so i would have to say it was a winner a good rich coffee flavor and a good price ,good flavor , great coffee
the pleasant aroma i put in a little cream and as i usually do and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter maybe it is because this is decaf but what i did like was its something cent coffees usually lack i have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days i have grown to like this coffee granted to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness but even i can tell this is gourmet coffee much better than the ones i get at my local coffee stands or even at when they give out free cups br br for a pack of the price seems decent if you drink decaf i think this is quite worth a try ,good quality coffee at a decent price , great coffee
not much of a decaf drinker unless i am craving a cup late night for some reason i have to say this coffee tasted average at best i am a coffee fan and coming from them to this well it missed the mark i gave some to my mother in law and she seemed happy with it so stars in that respect i might try mixing it with my non decaf coffee to see how it tastes but i am not holding my breath if the price was a few cheaper definitely would bump it up a star ,not bad not great , not as good as i be
if you are truly looking for a decaf that will no longer make your heart race this is not the coffee for you it is quite flavorful so i do recommend it to those who can still tolerate a bit of kick in their coffee ,gave me the , not as good as it is
i would recommend this as a good basic coffee it has a satisfying flavor and will make many a good cup of coffee i prefer drinking my coffee black and i found this to be produce a good cup it is not bitter and even though i had the decaffeinated coffee it did not taste flat like so many decafs do ,good coffee nothing though , not good
of joe just before i call it a night yeah sometimes i get a little due to too much caffeine intake and so i thought i would give this decaff a go what you get is a good cup without any bitterness but it is a little weak and i recommend dropping about more into your brewer to get a fuller flavor also as it is vacuum packed into a slim cardboard box it arrived completely squished flat nothing like the fat photo in the amazon product shot i know it is a minor thing to complain about but i like leaving my coffee out next to the coffee maker and this item would not even stand up it was about thick br br so you are not going to have mr wolf you for your great coffee with this one but for a decaff it is not half bad ,nice for a cup , not as good as i be
br br i m a little sensitive to caffeine and like to have a decaf on hand for drinking later in the day and i bought this primarily to use with my mr coffee frappe maker a href http www amazon com gp product b g mr coffee ounce frappe maker a let me just put in a quick for that i love it i found the riviera sunset stood up well to all the milk flavoring and ice in making a frappe again with a significant increase in the amount used br br i would probably not purchase this coffee just because of my own on coffee i look for bird friendly fair trade brands and i find nothing to indicate that melitta makes any effort to meet these expectations leaving aside these though i think those who enjoy a somewhat light easy drinking brew would like this coffee ,it is okay , good coffee
without all the fuss and this is what i was hoping for in the melitta riviera decaf to a good degree i was happy with it but it is certainly not something i would curl up with when in the mood for a really outstanding cup of coffee br br the are the aroma the of the grind and the overall taste which i would rate as fairly mild and maybe a slight bit on the acid side i found i liked it best either in a french press or in my espresso maker two that make the most out of somewhat weak coffee brewed i found i could compensate by using somewhat more coffee than usual br br still although not a serious to the world best coffees it does not cost a pound either i would have to say that for the price it is definitely worth trying ,good for a decaf , not as good as i have
great not like other decaf which seems to a weird taste to me if you keep different decafs to find one you like definitely give this a try ,great not like other decaf , good coffee
i like the smooth taste of this coffee it is decaf so not too strong but really not very light either it is just the light coffee that sometimes needed at mid day recommended ,like it , good coffee
this is good for packaged ground coffee and for decaf it definitely has a strong coffee flavor this is great for that down cup of coffee late night that will not keep you up because of the caffeine br br each sealed package holds ten ounces of extra fine ground coffee the bag feels sturdy if you prefer to keep your ground coffee in its original packaging br br with coffee prices going up it may be a good idea to compare the prices of this if you try this and like it you get a better price with the amazon subscribe save option versus getting coffee beans from your local coffee shop and grinding them at home or having the coffee shop grind them for you ,good for packaged ground coffee , good coffee
disclaimer i am a coffee addict i am also a starbucks addict so i have become a bit about my coffee preferences and cannot stand the economy stuff i have had regular melitta coffee before and was impressed by it so i decided to give the decaf version a try especially when the weather gets cold i like a nice hot cup of coffee in the evenings and do not particular want to be tossing and turning hours later br br the riviera sunset decaf coffee is an excellent decaf for those times you do not want the real thing it had a nice rich flavor with no bitter aftertaste while i continue to prefer the real thing on most occasions i am glad to know there is a good flavorful substitute for when i do not want caffeine ,real coffee taste without the , good coffee but not a great price
smooth with no sacrifice in taste and does taste as good as regular coffee i usually do not have any coffee after dinner and never really cared for decaf but i now have an after dinner alternative and no sacrifice in flavor ,very smooth and , not good
boy this was good the aroma when you first open the package leaves one with great anticipation that you will soon be enjoying a great cup of java too often times the result does not meet the expectations not so with the melitta cafe collection the coffee was amongst the best i have ever tasted treat yourself to a fantastic splurge ,delicious , not as good as it is
i am not a big fan of decaffeinated coffee i figure what is the point taste is so often compromised i have recently found that caffeine me if i drink it after pm so it is decaff or nothing at that point riviera tastes like regular coffee i was so impressed i decided to try it as my morning coffee i expected to have a very negative response to not getting the morning caffeine of my usual coffee but that did not happen if you must give up caffeine this is a great solution ,surprise , not as good as i be
i have decaffinated a few times and always find myself returning to coffee for the flavor with this product i will not have to do that anymore the flavor of this coffee is exceptional it is as full and rich as any off the shelf coffee i have ever tasted highly recommended ,coffee , delicious coffee
this melitta riviera sunset blend is a nice and light coffee that is suitable for anytime of day it is particularly great for drinking at night because it is decaffeinated the texture is nice and does not have an acidic taste or anything it is meant for casual drinkers i do prefer my coffee darker with caffine but i did enjoy this blend i would recommend giving this a try and judge for yourself ,great to drink after dinner , not as good as i be
this coffee was deep and rich and did not have a bitter taste too it i did have to use a little more than what was recommended to get it the way i drink coffee but coffee is a personal thing everyone has their desired strength the coffee was fresh upon opening but began to go down hill really quick as far as aroma and taste goes so in a good air tight container i liked this coffee but it i could go on in the morning if i did not have it ,excellent , good coffee but not a great price
we do not drink much coffee and less decaf but we have guests who do and so we like to keep some ground decaf in the freezer for when they visit everybody has been pleased with the melitta nobody has complained about the taste and plenty of folks have asked for second cups so they were not just being quiet we got the first sample free through the vine program but i would buy it in the future ,no , not as good as i have
i am not sure what all the fuss is about i thought it was a good coffee but not better than the store brand i usually buy and the store brand is much cheaper i will stick with it it is not bad coffee but i just do not seeing it being any better ,so so , not as good as it is
this makes a good pot of decaf nothing remarkable we have served this to many guests to no comments nobody asked us what it was but nobody spit it out either it is smooth and not too strong which is our preference we would not hesitate to buy it again but would not go out of our way either ,good nothing , not as good as it is
melitta cafe is a smooth flavorful coffee that compares well with regular coffee this is not the typical weak decaf blend that is true of many american brands melitta has a rich deep taste and a nice dark color tastes great black or with cream as a stand alone coffee no cream sugar it has a smooth though strong flavor just like regular coffee this coffee is especially great as an after dinner drink strong enough to taste like regular coffee but decaffeinated so it will not prevent sleep later great coffee ,smooth rich coffee , good coffee but not a great price
this product had a good nice scent and strong taste not too unique compared to a lot of over the counter canned already available but overall it is a good after dinner type of coffee to serve guests br br price wise it is reasonable but there are many other comparable products that may have a more taste overall it is a good product and worth trying for decaff drinkers ,nice strong blend , good coffee
this coffee has a nice flavor not too bitter just a nice round coffee taste rich flavor naturally decaffeinated with water and it is kosher what is not to love ,that is some coffee , not as good as it is
i have blended this with a darker full caf melitta coffee and love the results br br the fine grinding is a tad small for the french press i use but the taste is wonderful br br i was a little concerned at the variation in the two when i decided to blend but the outcome was fine br br the only real complaint i have is the packaging cheap glue on the metal fold down part causes it to fall off true for both bags i received so do not rely on that br br otherwise a delicious coffee that is mellow in taste the way i choose to prepare it ,good for half , not as good as i be
this is an excellent coffee rich and full of flavor not watery many decaf are obviously decaf this one tastes great with a medium body the grind is fine which works great in our drip coffee maker it also has a nice aroma and no bitter aftertaste it does not have the burnt flavor that a certain large chain has which personally i do not care for i found it closer to house blend but much better br br this is a great quality coffee highly recommended i will be buying more ,rich and full , good coffee
i am a big coffee drinker and this melitta cafe offering is rich with no bitterness sometimes decaf coffee has a funny oily aftertaste but this coffee had none of that highly recommended ,rich with no , not good
the coffee is good but it is nothing special compared to this is nearly the same just slightly better i do not feel it is worth the extra to buy this instead of a cheaper variety available anywhere i did enjoy the coffee but i probably will not buy it again unless it would be deeply discounted ,good but not special , not as good as i be
first of all when i opened my bag of melitta decaf it did not have that strong amazing rich coffee smell that my usual coffee has i brewed up a pot in my drip coffeemaker and while it was ok there was nothing outstanding about the taste it was bland and compared to the coffee i normally drink ,but nothing special , not as good as it is
i have a keurig coffee maker you know the one with the k cups to have a coffee like this you have to have a special filter which i do have honestly you will spend a of money on k cups if you do not get the filter for regular ground coffee anyway i do not know if it was because the coffee was ground or filtered a special way but the water in my keurig had a hard time seeping through causing a bit of an overflow aside from that the taste was smooth and flavorful it has a coffee taste plain and simple is it anything special not really it just tastes good and is reasonably priced ,coffee for the and price , good coffee but not a great price
i have been enjoying the melitta coffee in the evening it has a nice smooth taste with none of the burnt coffee bean taste of starbucks i used much more coffee than suggested in preparation though i used tablespoons to eight ounces of water i like my coffee strong but not bitter and this worked for a very good cup of coffee with half and half added i will be buying it again ,a nice smooth coffee , not as good as i like
very smooth and i used my own filters the smell is so i used my own measurements because it was not on the package i used l per cup and i worked out fine for me i like my coffee tasteful ,decaf coffee , great coffee
melitta filters and still individually make each cup of coffee in a single cup filter generally i use pre ground coffee so i am not a purist although i occasionally grind my own i usually drink two cups of coffee a day enough about my coffee habits br br melitta is a pretty trusted name in the coffee industry and i expected this coffee to be be a quality product i was not disappointed with the coffee although it was not quite as exciting as the regular vanilla flavored coffee i recently tried from melitta the flavor was pretty strong and rich although decaf always has a slight aftertaste even with the swiss water process used for generally i drink regular coffee as my first choice but i admit that i switch to decaf in the evening br br i have no problem recommending this coffee as a second choice ,great coffee flavor but still you know it is , great coffee
i do not like decaf coffee i think it has an aftertaste but i thought i would give this a try it truly surprised me there is a mellow full bodied taste with very little aftertaste to be found i will definitely buy it again to reduce the in our household ,surprisingly good , not as good as it is
i am not a huge fan of coffees from the i generally find them a bit light for my taste i m a big fan of sumatra and other grown coffees but riviera sunset is a nice light coffee smooth and not terribly acid it is a pleasant coffee for people who like their brews with more and less body br br i m also frankly not nuts about decaf but that aspect does not too much on the flavor here ,another good product from , not as good as it is
which i found pleasing br br i did face one challenge with this coffee the bag was very difficult to open without it after working on it for several minutes i had decided i was not going to let a bag beat me i discovered that i was able to open it be starting at the end where the bag was folded back once i got my finger inside the bag the rest came easy fortunately the two small tears i made in the bag were high enough to fold under when the bag was closed the bag recommends storage in a refrigerator br br this coffee is pleasant and refreshing and i have enjoyed drinking it if you are a coffee lover you owe it to yourself to give this coffee a try and see what you think i hope you are as pleased with it as i am ,one of the best coffees i have tasted , not as good as i be
ok i have to admit i was a huge fan you know that big coffee chain on every corner i did not expect much from a coffee ordered online but i take any thoughts back after the first sip of this smooth rich coffee there is none of the gritty acidic after taste of other coffees but instead a blooming silky flavor of nuts mocha and pure coffee mind you this is not a flavored coffee it has all of these built into the riviera sunset decaf blend oh did i forget to mention it is decaf i could not believe it myself when i looked at the bag the second day i thought it was true coffee by the flavor alone though i did notice the lack of as would any decaf highly recommended and i am switching ,better than that coffee , not good
this coffee has a more present flavor than the stuff they brew for us at work yet it goes down smoothly to my wife and i that is a good combination the fact that it comes already ground does not do anything to the flavor either ,full flavor smooth does not you with , good coffee
not morning without it br br i tend to buy more affordable e g supermarket type brands of coffee so i can splurge on tea so this was a real treat outstanding aroma just opening the bag and even better when brewing smooth taste and highly drinkable black the only way i drink coffee or tea br br my only complaint is opening the bag based on what other reviewers stated i opened it over a plastic so it would catch any very glad i did an amount was spilled when i cut into the bag i it into an air tight container i have had this problem with other vacuum packed coffee but the very fine grind of the melitta made it even more of a problem br br still not enough of a problem to warrant taking away a rating star this makes a wonderful cup of coffee ,wonderful aroma and taste but be the bag , not bad but not bad
i have tried to give up my coffee habit but it just has not been easy and i did manage to switch to decaf a couple years ago so i suppose that is something i am a moderate coffee drinker i like cups of hot joe to get me started in the morning and love a nice iced coffee on a hot afternoon this melitta riviera sunset decaf is smooth and does not have the bitter aftertaste that i dislike in one of the leading brands the flavor is great and i have enjoyed it both hot and iced ,smooth taste good hot and iced , good coffee
what can you say about coffee either you like it or you don t i liked this coffee although when i choose to review it i did not notice it was decaf that aside it tastes fine made in my keurig but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one ,very tasty , not as good as it is
taste and pleasant aroma it did not have that bitter plastic aftertaste you find in a lot of decaf coffees br br the grind is very fine my coffee filters let a little bit of the coffee through use good quality filters with this coffee br br it was difficult to open the package and the little wire closer fell off after the second time however i understand why coffee is packages this way to the exposure of the oils in the coffee to air and of course a fine grind has a larger surface to mass ratio making it age even faster so i forgive them for the packaging you really need an airtight container to store this kind of coffee br br personally i like to grind my coffee right before using but the convenience and taste of this melitta has convinced me that there are other options ,for quite excellent , not as good as i be
first let us talk about the packaging i hate when coffee come packaged in bags like this they are quite and in my opinion do not keep the coffee fresh enough br br as for the coffee itself this was one of the better tasting decaf i have had it has a very rich flavor that you do not normally find with decaffeinated coffee it has a wonderful aroma as well very pleased with this product ,great decaf , not as good as i be
when it comes down to melitta they definitely have known for all this time what it takes to really made a great cup of coffee with their cafe collection they bring out the best in flavors for all kinds of coffee lovers and that is really a strong aroma with their sunset they definitely bring out a decaffinated taste that feels like it is full of at the beginning of the morning i really love it the taste is strong and the aroma is just delightful all in all i absolutely recommend this as a great treat in the morning to wake up and enjoy br br price b br br taste b br br overall b ,smooth for decaf , not good
this coffee smelled wonderful while it was brewing my husband drinks a lot more coffee than i do and he agreed that this is a great tasting coffee we are looking forward to trying melitta other varieties ,love the aroma great taste , good coffee
tell that it was decaffeinated this is important because most decaf coffees have an odd taste to me but that was missing from this product br br furthermore i had to ask a coffee lover for an opinion so i asked my mother in law who drinks all kinds of coffees from all over the world almost times a day she was skeptical at first because she refuses to drink decaf however after a few sips of this coffee she said that although it is a mild coffee it was in fact very tasty and nothing at its decaf origins she liked it so much she poured another cup br br between the two of us we have almost finished the bag it should pass the test from even the coffee drinkers i positively recommend this product and i hope you enjoy your next cup of coffee from this company ,surprisingly good , excellent flavor
i prepared this coffee in a french press although it is ground too fine for this it had a nice aroma a full taste and mild bitterness it is a game to try to describe the taste of anything in any detail so i will just leave you with the coffee was quite good and it would make a good after dinner coffee br br my only complaint is the coffee is pre ground ground coffee is a bit stale by the time you get it however a blade grinder will ruin the coffee as well br br if you do not own a burr grinder this is the best cup of decaff you are going to get ,pretty good for , not as good as i have
this is the best decaf my family and i have tried in a long time it is smooth not bitter and has enough flavor without being too strong like some other brands i have tried i like that it is decaffeinated using the natural swiss water process instead of chemicals that is a big plus for me because many brands do not tell you how they decaffeinate their coffee i usually buy whole bean but this ground is so nice and fine and it saves me time having to grind it and get it just right i would suggest following the instructions given on the bag for the best taste seal tightly and store in the refrigerator to keep the flavor this is one i will be buying again ,excellent tasting coffee , not as good as i be
this review is from my wife br br i m not one who has all the right words for describing taste and flavor unfortunately i say unfortunately because this is a very good tasting coffee and it deserves elegant description what i can tell you is that it has no bitterness no bitterness at all actually it is rich and smooth yum br br i use a european coffee press for brewing and this grind worked beautifully in that not too course not small enough to make a mess through the screen ,great way to start or the day , not as good as i be
at last a decaf coffee that does not taste decaf smooth rich flavorful with no bitter aftertaste starbucks worthy but to my husband who does not care for starbucks it is way better we like to drink this in the evening and it is basically dessert with cream and sugar ,gourmet coffee for decaf lovers , not as good as it is
melitta cafe collection gourmet coffee is wonderful it tastes rich and just like a gourmet coffee should this coffee tasted like something i could have gotten in europe at a cafe br br it brewed very quickly and with no coffee grain residue this is probably due to the coffee being an extra fine grind the decaffinated version tasted great on its own without milk or sugar to season br br i m a coffee lover and i enjoy gevalia and godiva coffee two other excellent brands the melitta stands on its own and are their in taste and price enjoy a cup today ,there is nothing like a good cup of coffee , good coffee but not a great price
soon as i got this bag of decaf i made a big mug and it filled my house with the wonderful aroma of high quality fresh brewed coffee it is very finely ground but i still used the same amount i normally do and it turned out great i added some soy milk sat back and enjoyed my rare treat of an after coffee break definitely will buy some of this for the winter months so i can treat myself to excellent hot coffee any time of the day or night ,best decaf ever , great coffee
i often find with decaf coffee to be somewhat on the weak side not in this product the coffee had a strong but not bitter and had a smooth rounded experience when a creamer is used note this coffee works well with a soy creamer you do not need to apply any extra of coffee to compensate for a decaf option with such a strong i would not recommend milk or low fat milk as you might as well drink it as is ,strong flavor for a decaf brand , good coffee
decaffeinated ground coffee ounce bags a was fairly weak scent after all is a huge part of taste and this was disappointing br br even though i added more coffee grinds than the directions i found the coffee to be a bit bland the taste was more than flavored water but not amazingly so with no subtle overtones it was not bitter but it was not much of anything br br while i generally drink hi test as opposed to decaffeinated i do drink decaf at least twice a week the a href http www amazon com gp product b e melitta a was comparable to the generic brand that i usually have br br a href http www amazon com gp product b e melitta cafe collection riviera sunset decaf a is not a bad coffee but it is not worth the money if there are other options available ,so so average for decaf , not bad but not bad
a bit pricey br br br br update december br it still pains me to pay so much but looks like this will be the very st vine program item i ever got that will make an actual buyer out of me as a result i raise my review from stars to starts another thing i like is i have no decaf aftertaste that i always experience with other brands it is a wonderful thing to find at least one new thing for me anyway that i can still really enjoy that helps me relax in the middle of all this cannot eat this cannot drink that stuff going on in my life the past months it is also the time i have not felt like i was compromising good taste for good health for that i am truly grateful just ordered the pack on the amazon subscribe save page ,my money where my mouth is first decaf i can , good but not great
and cozy instant do not get me started br that why this new melitta riviera sunset gourmet coffee is a pleasant surprise it carries a full almost nutty flavor without the bitter bite of the coffee which for many their image of coffee and its lifestyle this is not surprising since melitta ad copy the feel of european a far cry from the lines at the morning coffee shop br no less than once said no coffee can be good in the mouth that does not first send a sweet offering of odor to the riviera sunset with its scent upon opening and does not disappoint when poured hold to the preparation instructions yours truly made one cup a little too strong and it came across a bit acidic its taste not its caffeine jolt is your wake up call recommended as a tastier if pricier alternative to major brands ,refreshing a flavorful decaf blend , not bad
it smells ok i agree with another amazon reviewer who said the package was difficult to open it was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open the bag tore apart br br no way would i spend bucks for this if i was addicted to it possibly but even then that is steep and i surely will not buy this in the future br br you can go down to the local name of popular coffee shop here and get bags for this price of freshly ground coffee br br melitta makes it sound like it is the greatest thing since sliced bread on their package gourmet swiss water process from europe charming cafe top quality hand picked beans br br if you want to pay this kind of money and like melitta coffee then get it but i do not think it is anything special ,not impressed , not as good as i be
i am not a coffee snob i can tell that there is a difference between and columbian but i cannot tell you which is which without a label this decaf tastes good i like mine with lots of fake sugar and cream the coffee flavor is not subdued by these additions the bag ultimately required scissors to open the for this says pack of i only got one bag not sure why that is it is happened before with other products would i buy this again sure if it was on sale that is how i buy my coffee most of the time ,a decent cuppa , not as good as it is
first off i received a bag of this coffee via the vine program to review at no cost secondly i am more of a bold slap me in the face french roast coffee drinker or starbucks gold coast so i had my about this decaf br br and well for me this coffee had a somewhat stale aroma upon opening the package an ok flavor once brewed sort of a nutty strange flavor at first and once consumed left an after taste in my mouth br br it is definitely a different roast than i am used to but it is decent for a pre ground decaf more of a medium roast as opposed to being a dark bold roast in my opinion overall not too bad br br i give this coffee a so so recommendation ,a decent decaf , not good
i remember the cool modern melitta drip coffee makers from decades ago a visual delight of glass and wood without a hint of plastic they were ahead of their time i wish i could say the same for their coffee it is fine coffee good actually however nothing really special i would buy it again if priced right but probably would not go out of my way to get it and certainly not at a gourmet price point i must be honest and say that with the melitta name i expected a little bit more maybe i just got a an off batch let us hope so ,yet another coffee to , not as good as i be
on an cool august evening we decided to try melitta riviera sunset decaf i in too much coffee and what we got was a bitter overly heavy cup i know others like their coffee to curl their hair with strong taste we like it strong but not that much on our next try we used less coffee and enjoyed a delightful semi sweet cup of decaf it was pleasing those who love strong robust full bodied taste ought to definitely buy melitta brand coffees ,me of , not good
always glad to find new gourmet blends to add to my list of favorites br br this blend seemed with a very nice aroma and a perfect even grind i usually grind my own beans but found that this grind worked nicely in my espresso machine as is it even produced a rich smooth crema unfortunately my first sip without sugar or milk was very bitter i ended up adding about a half teaspoon more sugar than i usually use just to compensate even then the coffee flavor itself was thin and weak with just a little milk added it tasted more like well flavored milk br br this coffee reminded me of the bland coffee my parents used to get for our drip coffee maker a couple of decades ago fine for that application but not really what i am looking for in rich smooth flavor with low bitterness ,nice aroma perfect bland and bitter flavor , not my favorite
this coffee tastes better than folgers that is not much of an endorsement but since folgers is about all i ever drink it is my only point of comparison i would recommend you do not try the stupid and experiment of replacing your usual caffeinated stuff with a cup of this some saturday morning as doing so will only result in one of those headaches it takes three over the counter to get rid of and in the meantime while you are trying to fight off the headache you will be completely unable to make with that you just got from amazon which was all your worst opinions of the before you had to lie down and your ,it is okay , not as good as i have
if you like to have a cup of coffee after dinner with desert then this is perfect i love it especially for the fact that i do not feel like a live wire all night from having caffine and the flavor is amazing nothing like a good cup of coffee to make you feel warm and after a wonderful dinner br br i have tried many different coffee and have to say this one has a wonderful full flavor without the bite of some of the cheaper coffee melitta is a great brand and well worth the money i also use this to make latte and it is great it is a really fine grind and great for which ever way you prefer to have you cuppa java you get what you pay for and this is well worth every penny ,great coffee that will not keep you all , great coffee
like to grind my own beans as i find the taste is better br br the smell from the bag was for a lack of better words pretty basic usually there is a distinct smell depending on the bean and there can be faint of something there was not anything distinct about this coffee br br i used a standard drip maker which in itself was probably not the best choice but i suspect it would not matter as i was surprised that there really is not a strong smell coming from the cup of coffee which i drank black br br the taste was kind of bland i did try a little piece of chocolate and it did seem to help br br overall it is an ok coffee if you are not an however it is not something i would add to my list of brands i purchase ,nothing , not as good as it
who like to add a lot of a fair amount of milk and sugar or one of those torani syrups e g a href http www amazon com gp product b e e torani syrup vanilla ounce bottles pack of a for a little extra flavor for those who like those kind of things it also makes a great iced coffee if cold brewed the coffee loses its edge and is more smooth and sweet but also loses a little personality in the process i did not try using this in an espresso machine as i do not have one but i do not think that it would yield a great espresso concentrated i think the acidity might become overwhelming br br all in all this is a fine blend of coffee at a fine price with a little experimentation on the it yields a fine cup of breakfast coffee ,a fine breakfast coffee for your coffee , not as good as i have
i am happy to say it surpassed expectations i made a pot without mixing it with anything and drank it black as i always do it is surprisingly drinkable if a little on the light side still the taste is fairly rich and winey though i do like a little more smoky aftertaste than this provides there really not much aftertaste at all truth be told it is as good if not better than nearly all the straight decaf coffee i have ever had and having it ground as opposed to beans really does not seem to be an issue here ground coffee does tend to go stale more quickly than bean so i would suggest using it fairly quickly but that is easy to do with a ounce bag if you are a decaf drinker and prefer not to have to grind beans i would highly recommend this brand ,had my but i am impressed , not as good as it is
the initial aroma upon opening the package was decent though subtle unfortunately it quickly i really could not smell anything after a minute which i assume is due to it being pre ground br br i brewed this coffee in a french press as well as in a drip brewer both results tasted flat and boring although there was a decent amount of body at least it was perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee for about the same price you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store ,meh , great coffee
i am amazed at the consistent flavor of melitta coffees seriously i sip any melitta coffee and can it immediately as they all taste the same not bad coffee always a darker roast and a deep flavor but always the same no matter what flavor is printed on the package the riviera sunset makes a nice rich cup of decaf coffee perfect for an after dinner treat ,a decent decaf , good coffee
melitta cafe riviera sunset coffee is not bad it just sadly is not all that great either it is not something i would buy again mainly because i will probably forget about it ,unremarkable , good coffee
i have had to cut back on caffeine recently because of heart that seemed to be made worse by all the coffee i drink cups a day maybe so i am mixing melitta colombian and decaf i substituted this for the other decaf i have been drinking and found that it has a rich smooth taste very little to none of the burnt taste that decaf often has the price on amazon makes it a pretty good buy as well i do not care for the packaging however i could not get it open without cutting the top and then i had to transfer it to an old coffee can to store it with all the mess that that if it were in a can i would be more inclined to buy it but the taste for a decaf is quite good ,rich smooth taste , not good
not all that much root per teabag though and since i like strong coffee i only use oz of water per bag and steep it covered for mins then with some cream and sugar it is quite good br br as for the liver claim well flow and supposedly helps clear out some stuff up the liver i do not know about that yet but so far i have not noticed any ill effects from drinking this i feel fine if not good after drinking a cup but that is as far as i can confirm the effects br br and with even decaf coffee containing mg caffeine per serving this stuff being completely caffeine free is a blessing for those of us who go bananas and light public on fire when we get the slightest bit of caffeine anyone who needs a coffee substitute do give this a try ,good stuff , great coffee
i have read lots of other reviews this tea as coffee tasting or with roasted flavors but to be very it tastes just the way i could imagine second hand smoke would it is very very strong requires minutes to steep and is not for the faint i have heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product but i was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits good luck to those who care to this roasted flavor ,really , not as good as it is
i have been taking this tea twice per day and i am enjoying the way i feel ,great tea , great tea
this is part of dr oz tea diet works like a charm i have lost inches already and i have been on it for days ,of dr oz tea diet , great tea
this was the worst tasting tea actually the worst tasting anything that i have ever consumed i took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup it tasted like dirt which makes sense since it is a root the rest of the tea bags are going in the trash ,nasty , great tea
hands down by far the absolute worst tasting tea i have ever had and i have allot i am an avid tea drinker and i just cannot get it down the benefits are supposed to be amazing so i will keep it around to water down and sugar up but wow it is bad so strong too tastes like dirt that been on in the woods ,good for you tastes like bitter , not as good as it is
root is reported to aid in reducing high blood pressure which is why i drink it i have pretty much given up coffee drinking and this is a tasty substitute though one must acquire a taste for it at home i use bulk roasted root but these tea bags are fantastic during travel ,my go to coffee , great coffee
i really like this tea i started drinking it at the suggestion of a friend br it helps to sooth an upset i will be buying it again in the future ,this is great tea , great tea
i love this brand of root tea the tea is so good for your health and keeps you regular transaction went smooth like always so glad to hear amazon may soon have home delivery of groceries to my door i have some that require someone to shop for me but i do a lot of it on amazon com ,cup of tea a day keeps the away , great tea
i love this tea and it makes you feel very healthy which is so needed during the christmas and new year season i have not used it in one week and i can soooo feel my body needing a good i recommend for anyone who has stomach issues over and wants to feel generally better ,love it , great tea
my item fast it was exactly what i ordered in excellent shape with safe shipping i will came back and shop here again thanks ,excellent item and service , great product
i drink this tea every day i m months pregnant and have done so since i found out i was pregnant i love that it is organic and contains all the herbs that support a healthy pregnancy i do not notice anything dramatic when i drink it or do not drink it but i will say i feel when i drink it and have had no pregnancy whatsoever i am this is my first pregnancy and i have been exceptionally healthy throughout i highly recommend this for any pregnant woman at least a cup a day ,use it every day , great tea
never take sugar in my tea either if you have read this far you are waiting for me to say how bad it was you cannot imagine how bad it is without i would describe the flavor as a very bitter tasting dirt yes as a year old with children i know what dirt tastes like and this tastes like dirt but with a super bitter taste that makes it hard to drink my recommendation is to let it steep for a amount of time as to not make a rich bold tea as you know the longer it the bolder the tea becomes do not do that with this four stars because it is apparently very good for you and i thank the company for bringing it to us regardless of the taste of death when other tea companies are using artificial ingredients to make their teas taste better ,good for you but worst tasting tea , not as good as i be
i was pleasantly surprised by the stronger than i expected ginger flavor in this product it is excellent if you like ginger try this best on hot biscuits update i have just reordered wish they sold it by the gallon its different something you cannot find locally and excellent ,great on biscuits , best hot chocolate ever
through a screen however this was so broken up that it was just br br i have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point i most likely will not be ordering it again br br that being said the whole leaves that were there on the top looked fine it does have a bit of a green tea taste vs some other high quality white tea i am used to however it is not bad or anything definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag was not mostly powder br br i took a couple so i will post them keep in mind this came in two pouches i poured into tins and that is where i took the pictures the product does not actually come in tins ,powder instead of leaf , not bad but not bad
i love this tea both the green and white varieties are quite consistently fresh i have ordered this at least ten times from various internet sites i did not realize how old and stale tea from the grocery store was until i had this brand for organic tea it is quite reasonably priced they recommend using two tsp of loose tea per cup i use half that and it tastes great never ever bitter very smooth tasting i highly recommend ,high quality fresh tea , great tea
was glad to find this on line as it is not sold in stores around here found a jar at a grocery outlet and decided to give it a try sure glad i did i researched this company and they have been in business since this is the only butter i really like it is made with peanuts with no sugar and chemicals added to make it taste better it does not need to add anything great product and seller was prompt and shipping was reasonable ,best peanut butter made , not as good as it is
this was a great mother day gift the packaging is unique very and well designed inside are different pouches for each of the wine a flavors the box is substantial it feels great wrapped up in wrapping paper also the wine a people had the to put two different types of recipes on the box one for wine and one for hard alcohol brilliant move in my opinion my mom is not the biggest liquor drinker so now she can make iced drinks with wine as the base rather than hard alcohol though other reviews state that they only received the drink pouches in a plastic bag this was not the case for my purchase i will update this review if we with the recipes ,mix it up big , not as good as it is
this is definitely a girl alcoholic there are different flavors and you can use any wine you choose the package directions are for an entire blender of slush i have found that using a tablespoon or two at a time makes just enough for one person good stuff have not found anyone who does not like this product ,wine a , good but not great
i have tried all of the flavors and every one of them are all delicious they are great for parties and entertaining ,great , great taste
this review is for the packaging and not the actual mix since the mix is a very subjective thing and my taste my not match others and some wrote about how poor the packaging was all i can say is with mine there is more than enough labeling on the bags themselves and on the box there are instructions on how to granted the box is nothing heavy duty or special and the mix is in plain white bags there are more than enough instructions to go by ,packaging was , not as good as it is
i bought these and yes they do come in plastic bags with a label on each but also included was a five sided box that you can fold together that has a picture of each flavor one on each side it makes a cute little colorful box nice to give as a gift if you put it together ,cute packaging if you it all , not as good as it is
i also bought two of these as gifts and will be returning them for the same reason as some of the others unacceptable packaging unless you have already tried the product there is nothing about this that makes you want to try it i assumed big mistake that there would be some kind of packaging but there was not this is really sad too because the product is great ,disappointed , not as good as it is
i purchased this as a present but it does not come as shown in the picture it is little white bags with the flavor written on them someone receiving it as a gift would not even know what it was unless i explained it to them will be returning ,not as messy , not as good as it is
i bought this for a christmas gift but i will be returning there is no box or packaging as pictured it is just white baggies containing the mixes which would be fine if i was just buying for myself but not for a gift ,not as , not as good as it is
not a fan of flavored coffees i would only give them a rating as to me they taste artificial and weird like all flavored coffees do the regular coffees were very good better than many i really liked the and the medium roasts not so much the colombian the dark roast mexican and french roast were very good i made them into ice coffee strong but not bitter i did not care for the costa rican light roast it had an artificial taste to me the house blend was good but nothing to write home about i hate decaf so i used that k cup to water my plants with so as far as taste goes i have no idea but my plants up the chocolate raspberry went nicely into a chocolate cake batter in place of water and it was delicious if priced right i would buy them again ,nice variety for or to try flavor , good flavor but not the best
i ordered in order to get variety of flavored coffees and have to admit disappointed in the selection several of ordinary coffees received also of the flavors advertised which were my primary reason for ordering were not included ,expected received , great coffee
product was timely delivered as advertised there is a wonderful selection of coffees which my clients and i are currently enjoying will order again ,good coffee , great coffee
i was very excited to my shipment today then to be because of the flavors that i was told would be in the package were not there i really wanted to try creme brulee and raspberry chocolate truffle i am looking forward to trying the others but had i know i would not receive these flavors i would not have ordered this product i also did not the pink flavor ,disappointed , not as good as it is
love van houtte k cups the selections provided allow one to sample coffees from different as well as taste the flavored coffees without having to buy a complete box of each then you can pick the ones you like buy that particular coffee great concept ,great selection , great coffee
this is very good coffee i have been this coffee for a long time an as long as amazon i will keep buy it i like the tast it has a nice chocolate tast to it ,coffee , good coffee
i love the option at amazon and am using it to get this smooth and non bitter coffee i love it ,very nice coffee , great coffee
i got this at a local discount store for it has an excellent flavor and the only reason i gave it stars instead if was personal preference ,good chocolate taste , great taste
my first package came damaged but the first rate customer service department replaced it quickly the are delicious and easy to cook ,delicious organic , great taste
i am not sure why no one seems to like these very much they are pretty good to us i have not had a problem with them falling apart and they are easy to slice for my son who is the one on the diet is extremely picky and suspicious of anything new ate these muffins without i sometimes a hole in the middle and serve as a bagel these are a regular staple in our house ,we like em , good but not great
if you need gluten free non dairy and no egg are pretty slim br br if you use a really sharp knife and work carefully you can split them successfully br br great for mini pizzas ,pretty good , gluten free bisquick
these are ok i like the sweet potato ones better and both have good fiber content ,g english muffins , good
a href http www amazon com gp product b g ener g foods english muffins ounce units pack of a br br these are one of my favorite gluten free items and a regular item to keep on hand i take for lunch and toast and very filling and easy but cheaper than going to fast food places i use for mini pizzas buns bacon egg and cheese sandwich for breakfast chicken sandwiches etc easy to take on trips or friends and family to eat must toast or bake for best favor ,g foods english muffins , great for
how can you go wrong with buying these in bulk for less than per unit when they can run as high as per unit retail ,great value for the cost , great product
these are great we were told to stay away from wheat barley and rye this is a good answer for us they a not pre cut so you have to cut them in to i recommend them ,gluten free english muffins , great snack
pkg says soy free ingredients and my stomach bladder say otherwise br also lots of fiber in this one if you can handle fiber and soy this food will fill you up like crazy if you have ibs and have trouble with fiber or are eating a low residue diet be careful br i m going back to the bread eating a sandwich on it grilled is a fair substitute for the wheat ,soy free not so sure , great product
this product is very good but i have this feeling that it is rather highly priced i do not know why gluten free products in general are very expensive when they are made from easily available ingredients people with gluten problem are not just eating healthy but are sick and should not be i like the muffins particularly when they are toasted ,good but slightly expensive , not as good as
tried this item liked it this item was cheaper to get than buying at the local store easier to get and it has a longer shelf life than what i was getting around here driving miles one way is local p s these can make great mini pizzas ,gluten free english muffins , great product
the ener g english muffins that i received from amazon were not of the same quality when i buy them directly from the distributor in seattle they crumbled and had dense places that were not really edible also there were only in the pack instead of i had to cancel my recurring order ,g english muffins from amazon , not as good as it is
the ener g foods english muffins look good in the packaging but something in them makes them mushy on the bottom this presents a feel in the mouth and both my husband and i got stomach aches will not be buying this again ,mushy english muffins , good product but not as good as you are
these english muffins are okay at best they are very hard to cut and break apart easily making it hard to toast they definitely have to have something like jelly or peanut butter spread on them otherwise do not taste the best ,not like regular english muffins , not as good as
if you are looking for english muffins go to the grocery store and buy them these do not even resemble english muffins and are tasteless however if you are on a restricted diet wheat flour soy dairy gluten etc these might be for you check the list of ingredients i did not care for them at all ,these are english muffins , good but not great
i tried these for a substitute for a sandwich roll i could not cut them without falling apart i ended up them in pieces more like chunks and with enough cream cheese they were only ok tapioca hamburger rolls are the only products i would recommend ,cannot keep them from , good but not great
these are not the greatest thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come not so they were not what i had expected ,english muffins , good
come on amazon give me a break powdered tofu get in some real food and i will buy more from you i went looking for table sugar you have got weird kinds of sugar that you expect me to buy in bulk but no just plain sugar i am not any more of this rice and tofu bread either br br sorry i just had to ,why is this our only choice for bread , great taste
dried berries still with texture and the aroma pot roast is so much better with half a dozen berries flattened into the and scooped into the mixture but in ten years trying to find them so now i know to look for it on amazon ,lovely , good
again exactly what i ordered no fuss no muss arrived on time pretty much an ideal transaction only thing that threw me was that i the quantity gallon baggie in the freezer ,what i ordered , not as good as it
berries are find but the package is bad unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor ,get a new , not as good as
i have been sampling as many sugar free chocolates as i can find this one was okay but not the best i do not think what i got was the either as it had some of that white coating on a portion of the bar the best i have found so far is brand at another website ,just so so , not as good as it is
shipping was really good and i got what i ordered on time will buy from again alittle pricy but my little dog likes them ,jerky , good
do not buy review online looks like another treat made in china with multiple reports of suspected poisoning please only buy treats made in the usa ,the name of made in china , great product
thanks to amazon for carrying this wonderful product my local grocery store no longer carries this product and generally thier private label house brands br for those folks whom enjoy this product cant be beat br it is fast and very easy to prepare and a excellent italian pasta dinner can be ready in minutes or less br for me i do add some extra cheese to the mix yet that is personal preference br we really enjoy tossing in some boneless and skinless chicken grilled to add to the sauce and create our own chicken br thanks again to amazon and to for making this product br br pa ,sauce , great product
i love to eat pasta but totally on how to make one saw this while at the grocery earlier decided to try it followed the instructions and one awesome dinner note i did add some parmesan and cheese to add more flavor ,awesome , great product
i went searching for charcoal dog biscuits after reading that they help with digestive gas and bad breath this appears to be only one of two brands on the market i have not tried the other one i think it is called because the other did not make a biscuit for small dogs my dog has been eating one a day and i cannot say for sure whether or not they work she used to have really smell gas she has not dropped a like that in a while so maybe it is due to the biscuits who knows she does like these biscuits very much so i will surely buy them again ,one of two on the market , my dog loves them
i have a year old scottish terrier who has some food allergies no wheat for my girl this treat is great for an upset stomach and my dog looks forward to her charcoal bone treats ,healthy treat for dogs with allergies , my dog loves these
my dog loved these and i think they probably helped with his gas and dare i say his breath too ,well received treat , my dog loves them
everyone here who is tried energy has been surprised by its unique ability to pleasantly br hope it will become more readily available ,best yet , best best ever
love the products both the sugar free and the regular are great feel refreshed absolutely no crash no after taste stopped drinking monster and full and started drinking ,best energy drink hands down , great taste
most of the time you want crackers because you want to get the dip or whatever topping into your mouth with these you can have those snacks again without having to worry about the calorie content of your crackers br br they re only calories a slice and each slice is about the size of a x they are delicate and have a nice easy crunch these ones in particular have a lower sodium content as well versus the and garlic ones they re a bit higher in sodium content over mg per slices br br it an excellent addition no matter what diet you are on or if you are not even on a diet i bring them to parties and everyone always asks what they are and where can they get them ,great for low calorie , great for
ingredients could not get much and gave them a try topped with cheese or a sandwich spread or whatever you would like they are very tasty i feel as full after or of these topped of course as i did with just white bread they are nice and thin so it is not like biting into anything hard just a nice crunch the flavor is not strong at all it is very mild and nothing like a rye bread you might have purchased in the past then i noticed that they are only calories per slice what is not to love they taste good they are whole grain they are super low in calories it is no crunchier than a potato chip and i feel satisfied while chewing and after eating them oh and they keep forever in the cupboard i definitely will be buying these for a long time ,super tasty and just to be healthy , delicious and delicious and healthy
great alternative for those who cannot eat wheat a little bland but crunchy and crispy ,crackers , great for
as someone who suffers occasionally from digestive these kavli crispy thins are among the few things that i can eat at such times i always keep these crackers around to add to soups however there are also times when they are the only thing i can properly digest this is a great item to have around when having digestive associated with the or stress for me they work better than the bananas rice applesauce or toast of the diet used in ibs these thin easy to chew crackers are a really great product ,helps , great snack
based on other reviews i tried these kavli products they are great low fat snacks these are great with natural peanut butter and jelly between br br recommended ,another great snack , great snack
kavli crispy thin crispbread is the right consistency for multiple uses the taste is fantastic it is fresh and pleasant to eat kavli products are the best ,the best cracker ever , delicious
butter she says we have been using crackers like these kavli crispbreads to get down the peanut butter since before i can remember i think it was when and mary published power plan in the late s many years ago we found these to be the best we could only find them in grocery store in and now that the has moved us again to fort ky we can only find them at kroger recently we cannot seem to find them there either so we order them they come fast not broken and they are fresh also they are not any more costly to purchase online and pay for delivery than to waste time looking for them one note my wife hates things and we found the best way to do so with these is to cut off the end of the with scissors prevents cracks of this thin bread ,crunchy , great product
i enjoy my kavli crispy thins so much and so often that i now order by the case besides being naturally low fat and naturally nutritious kavli crisp thins are a great replacement for salty fattening and or pizza with crispy thins you can make your own nachos by the crisps w chopped tomatoes cheese even ground meat pop crisp thins w toppings in microwave and you have got your delicious nachos or pizza i have crispy thins w melted cheese every morning great way to start the day no i do not work for kavli this is not an ad but a review also so nice and easy to be able to order kavli and just about everything via amazon ,crispy versatile delicious , delicious and healthy snack
wheat free natural ingredients easy to chew dry by itself but is good with coconut oil and or fruit spread ,wheat free alternative , delicious
i have not seen these on the shelf for a while now so decided to buy here although boxes is a lot they are great with butter and honey have not tried them with anything else br they re very thin and fragile and so whatever you put on them will stand out but they still have a healthy taste ,very nice , good for you
this crispbread is nice and thin great for those with more sensitive teeth br br i eat of these in the morning for breakfast with sugar free jelly on them br guilt free and delicious br br you do have to be a little careful when spreading heavy stuff on them like peanut butter br if you press too hard they can break br br one thing you cannot tell from the box is that there are actually air tight packs in the box br br i m currently eating these and the sesame rye crispbread br highly recommend both br br note i have lost pounds by changing my diet but i give the most credit to things rye crispbread replacing almost br all of the flour in my diet and drinking oolong tea which helps burn belly fat br you do need to exercise a little bit too ,nice and thin , great for a great price
i love rye used to eat the thick rye crisps but my old teeth just cannot handle them anymore but i still love some crunch i also like to eat healthier and these crisp thins are whole grain and have more fiber than many bread options br br it was getting harder to find them locally so i started getting them here on amazon so i never have to be w o my favorite cracker another bonus i have had these around the house for years but my kids never showed any interest just some weird thing mom ate until i ordered a whole box of them last month my last daughter still at home thought maybe she should try them since i bought so many now she is hooked so she is taking them off to college with her ,love these thin , delicious and delicious
you might think possible br br as soon as i saw the first one i was amazed it made it through the shipping process in one piece so far i have not come across a single broken cracker my next thought was well as soon as i bite into it the thing going to explode into a tiny shards i was amazed when it held together and showed only a perfect half moon hole where my teeth had been these crackers really hold together nicely br br the flavor is very plain there is no seasoning and very little salt they taste like the grains they are made from i have ordered a case of the garlic flavor and look forward to trying them i eat these with a generous spoonful of very low calorie pepper and spread that makes for a very low calorie snack i highly recommend these ,thin crispy and good , not the best
i have been buying this delicious crispbread for many years but for some reason it is no longer available in stores it is an all rye product with only natural ingredients and is just a few calories per cracker because it is so thin it does not overwhelm the flavour of cheese or which is my favourite thing to have with the crackers i thought maybe i would overdone it by buying two cases but i am already into the second box after just a week ,crispy thin and delicious , delicious and delicious
i highly recommend this product cannot beat the calorie count my favorite use is putting natural crunchy peanut butter and blackberry jam between two pieces also great with cheese healthy product ,great product , great taste
i discovered these when i moved to canada a few years back before this i had only experienced a thicker wasa crispbread and was a bit put off at first the feelings dissolved the first time i ate one of these with light laughing cow cheese they are a little more powdery than i would like but they compliment most cheeses very well without overwhelming them ,for those who want the , great product
the title says it all if you want a cracker that does not with the flavor of what you are topping it with but also adds a delicate crunch this is your cracker br br recently at a friends house we were having some various crackers with a little butter and when i asked what the first cracker was i was presented with a box of kavli crispy thin crackers the only way i have tried them so far is plain or with homemade cranberry jam and they are hard to put down br br i was a little surprised to see the other reviews bringing up the healthful of these crackers as the two main reasons i love them so much have nothing to do with anything other than what i want out of a cracker light crispy texture and delicious flavor ,the best cracker on earth , not as good as you are
hard to find on the store shelves does not over power the flavors you put on it ,thin , good
i just tried this crackers and am so pleased they are very very thin but strong enough to hold a spread at only calories per large cracker x inch size you really can enjoy a nice treat for under calories a wonderful find for those of us that try to eat healthy and with some control ,oh crispy and only calories , delicious
product was as described it was shipped promptly and i will be consuming it as part of a diet it is the only bread that i am allowed ,bread , great product
i discovered the kavli thin crackers in paris at marks spencer in and kavli has been since my bread and i was happy when we moved to the us in to find them also here br br i can say that kavli has been an important part of helping me to keep my weight ,crackers are an of my diet , great product
it is very strong and pure you just need a little bit to get a great flavor helps with digestion but the smell is strong ,smells , good flavor
this tea has no flavor tastes like dust it looks like quality pretty package but it is no good lipton regular is superior ,bland , not as good as it is
some years ago i have tasted lots of iced tea and this one makes as good as you can find anywhere i will say that most recipes i could find must have been for some cheap tea bags weak somewhat tasteless and bitter so i experimented a little and found a great recipe for this loose leaf tea the recipe is cup tea to cups water bring the water to a boil take it off the heat put the tea in let it steep for no more than minutes and strain into a container let cool to room temperature and refrigerate if you are in a hurry fill a glass with ice and pour the tea over the ice this works great for this particular loose leaf tea not strong not weak oh yes if you like sweet tea add the sugar to the container while the tea is hot ,perfect for ice tea , great for the price
these are so tasty i use them when making my cheesecake cookies and in pancakes there is nothing that they cannot be used in they taste sweet and not overpowering ,sooo yummy , delicious
order these with the idea in mind of putting them in waffles pancakes a recipe that i had ,breakfast dishes , great product
looking for bits as real blueberries seem to have no flavor these days these were very good would def buy again ,loved , great taste
i buy gosh that is good sugar free white velvet all of the time this is the best white chocolate that i have ever used it may be a little expensive but it lasts a long time buy it and enjoy ,best white chocolate , best popcorn ever
i have been looking at this product for a couple months and finally gave in first of all the name got my interest the taste is delicious but i am having problems with the directions have not figured out if it is actually a hot beverage or do you put it in a hot beverage it has a scoop small and says to put that in a cup instructions for oz and then put a couple shots of hot water shots of water and you can add milk hum confused but i guess i will work with it hope it does not take the whole container very large to figure it out i would have given it stars had i understood the instructions ,delicious with , not as good as it is
this stuff is amazing fast shipping and most of all the best tasting sugar free low calorie item on the market i use it in my coffee and its a real treat br br thank you will be ordering more very soon ,love it , best of the best
beef is a beef japanese cow with an american cow it is the best possible beef you can get in the us and is not illegal ,is wrong , great product
four stars if that were my only gripe but i have a problem with the size first off these cuts are only one inch thick which is offensive i steak should be at the bare minimum two inches thick i do not even associate with and can only imagine the that these people against decent food cannot these people just eat or not at all please do not get me started for i wanted to include drugs in all fast food particularly the bargain menu but that is merely a hope and dream for another day br br secondly is not there a law somewhere about a steak less that two pounds my this is a sampler a i suppose these cuts are intended to be given away at those offensive stores that the to as to a br br lastly i must close this review before i become too ,okay for a get , not as good as i like
beef comes from a specific in japan and is illegal to import in to the united states in fact it has been illegal to import since in any form this is just overpriced regular american beef ,not beef , not as good as it is
my youngest cat is very particular about what he eats he absolutely will not eat if something does not meet his expectations between that and the recent pet food recalls i have had a really hard time finding cat food that i can feed him i am happy to say that the merrick turducken with him plus it has no wheat gluten or other fillers the texture of it is appealing too it is not just mush or spam looking like many foods i will continue to buy turducken and plan to also try out some of the other merrick flavors ,my picky cat loves it , cat cat food
i open a can of this stuff and it looks like real food i spoon it onto the dishes for my four and it dishes like actual meat and sauce all four of them right into it and all four are licked clean br br i have seen the health benefits to my cats from feeding them high quality grain free food this turducken canned food is one of the of their diet i love feeding it to them and they love eating it br br in my view it is worth the extra money to get really good food for one pets ,my cats love this real food cat food , my cat loves these
really gets the mouth watering a little over at big the price listed here is insane ,perfect for in water , good coffee
i have used this bbq sauce before and it is good especially considering that is free of so many like corn syrup and for us gluten but the price on this cannot be right order directly from the daddy sam website to pay oz bottle this price would have to be a case price although the description says oz ,price cannot be right , great product
this was a cute affordable set for my y o son golf theme party they were a great size for a half sheet cake and he is played with them as toys since his party ,perfect for my cake , great for
i only used one green with it is ball etc with the golfer on the cake i made one long hole with fairway sand traps water and green my hubby loved it for his big th golf themed party i used the extra golf clubs balls and on the table around the cake if i had a huge sheet cake to decorate i could see using the three greens but it would not have fit right on one x cake knowing i was buying wilton made me that i would be very satisfied and i was and for the price i could not go wrong ,really cute made a great cake , great product
the golf set arrived quickly and was just as pictured the birthday for my five year old grandson turned out great ,cake , good but not great
the best sugar substitute at this time is virtually replacing sugar in our home bakes and measures the same as sugar with no aftertaste cannot wait for it to go mainstream to be able to buy in our supermarkets ,the best sugar substitute , best water ever
from both the pet store and the grocery store the alpo chicken in gravy is all he will eat i can sometimes feed him the t bone steak flavor i guess it looks and tastes more like people food than the other varieties my only complaint is that when i received the shipment pack of almost all of the cans were dented and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can one can leaked out the dent was at the seal on the top normally i am not someone who is picky about dented cans but this was a little much a couple of the cans actually had a funny smell when i opened them so i guess i will go back to buying at the grocery store just thought having them shipped to the house would be easier than them home from the store oh well ,dog loves the food but the cans were dented , great product
i am absolutely amazed with the taste of this product i am not too much of a fan of the caramel dip but the syrup is equally as delicious as its pancake i highly recommend it but ask your local grocers to see if they are willing to carry it this is far too expensive than what i paid going to my grocery store ,wow , best ever
i feed my two and occasional rescue newman advanced dog formula i like this better than the regular newman because it has less ingredients i supplement with high quality can food organic free range chicken healthy powder and salmon oil my boys are healthy their coats are amazing highly recommend but with supplements see above ,good stuff , great product
newman products have been used in our home for years after researching newman adult dog food i felt confident in giving the food to our two they love it one of them it down in seconds really i it br with so many companies dog foods i felt the newman company being organic would be more reliable keeps me from worrying so much as i pour that bowl of food for them ,top of the line product , my dog loves it
this food is great my year old beagle loves it and she is much more active since i changed her food i highly recommend this dog food ,great for dogs , my dog loves it
love the fact that it is on save the change to this food has had many benefits my dog loves it has aided in the of tear he part beagle part king charles and makes his poo firm ,great food , great product
it a try br br they say that it takes a dog a while to get used to a new food but i have to tell you from the first day i gave him the newman own he refused to eat the organix anymore he loved the newman own so much even though he would eaten the organix for years i even tried mixing the bit of organix i had left in with the newman own but he would just pick out the pieces and leave them on the floor next to his bowl br br so i do not know what it is but my dog sure seems to love this food he is eating more now and he is very healthy br br again i had no complaints about the organix i think it is probably a good dog food but my dog sure prefers the newman own ,my dog loves this food , great for
reading some positive reviews here on amazon for newman i decided to give it a go surprisingly my dog started eating the food immediately after i poured some into his dish he never does that with other dry dog food and usually to eat after i have given him a nibble of everything that i eat during the day what makes it even better is the reasonable price for the quality yes i understand that organic and quality us made food are naturally more expensive however some of the brands charge double of newman and provide only half the taste as humans we are usually sold by the nutritious wholesome when buying dog food however i think its pretty important for my dog to actually like the taste of the food also newman seems to be the ticket for both nutrition and taste will be buying newman as a regular ,my picky dog loves this stuff , my dog loves them
we have been feeding our dog newman own since she was very young she was a eater and i was a determined owner who on organic food both of our needs were fulfilled when we found this great product it is the only dog food that she has eaten and she is going to be years old next month the only reason she ever has gone to the vet is for her shots i highly recommend this food i am sooo glad amazon carries it now because we had to drive quite a distance to buy it before at a organic pet shop ,great dog food , great dog food
i am very pleased with this dog food have not ordered anything else for my dogs since i bought this my lab and my poo both eat it happily and i am happy that it is healthy for them ,great healthy dog food , great product
it took for a week to waiting them to ship for the item but soooo pleased to myself and my dog thank you for the newman daughter to keeping an awesome company n caring our pets stars ,an awesome awesome dry food for your dog without about any , my dog loves them
i switched my dog to this food and watching him truly enjoy eating and the taste of his food is worth anything he has eaten precise foundation formula for the almost two years since i adopted him he often goes off his food and or vomits from time to time i have tried switching him to wellness and blue buffalo with no positive results i cannot tell you the immediate difference in him from the first time he ate the newman and he looks forward to every meal does not beg for other stuff because he is satisfied and he seems to have more energy he is a lb great and finally very happy with his food ,my happy dog , my dog loves them
the ingredients are really wholesome and fast delivery br it would be nice if they had some type of fish formula though br but my dog loves them and will buy again ,my dog favorite , my dog loves these
we switched to this brand because one of our dog eyes always and someone said it could be from a corn allergy this is one of only a few brands that is corn free and it the eye problem quickly blue brand does not contain corn but they include garlic in their blend which can cause kidney problems in dogs over time according the it smells more natural than purina one which i had been feeding them and they seem to like it better i like that the sales from the food go to charity too a good product ,great product , great product
we have originally bought this as our dog first food and then switched to wellness dog had runs for a few weeks hoping it would go away then went back to newman own and now our dog feels a lot better never switched his food ever again ,our loves this , great product
my dogs love this food no allergies more energy and nicer coats my big dogs skin does not seem nearly as irritated and i am assuming with a little more use his skin will be normal again we like it m than any other i have seen my only problem is that i have dogs one huge one and lbs hardly make it a month we really could use bigger bags or a discount plus i cannot find this in any stores so when i ran out i had to by a substitute br update my second shipment did not arrive at all i have been trying to contact buyer but i cannot figure it out had to go back to the old food at least i realize that this food did not help with the dry itchy skin that the dogs have ,more please , my dog loves it
this brand is the lowest price i can find in organic dog kibbles the subscription is convenient i wish the company makes pound bags ,great product , great product

i buy newmans own adult dog food for my two chihuahuas i have always fed them natural human grade dog food even though most brands can be a bit pricey like most pet parents i try to do the best i can for my dogs which starts with feeding them right most dog food can be disgusting and the practices behind it are newmans own is more affordable and i feel good about the company and practices so it was worth a try br br my dogs love it so it was easy to switch from the other brand they gobble it up i now have it on subscription so we do not run out ,great product my dogs love it , my dog loves it

i have been searching for a no corn natural dog food to keep skin away tried halo which was great but so expensive this is a little more affordable and the ingredient list looks very similar to halo but oh boy i am just glad it is warm enough to have the windows open my dog loves the taste and the quality seems great so we will try more days to see if things settle down ,my mix horrible , great product
i read all the reviews before buying this food and overall i was impressed with the product myself the dogs like it they have no ill effects as reviewer looking at her other reviews i think hers should be tossed by amazon and i can get it for even less on a subscription with prime which means day no cost shipping whats not to love i do mix this with some prescription diet j d since i have one older dog and with some allergies and the combo seems to help bottom line it is a good product and after doing a ton of reading i do not buy my animals cheap food or anything that i think comes from china i think it does everything it claims ,dogs love it , my dog loves it

i have tried some different foods for my dog but this is the one she the best i have a year old border lab mix and have been giving her this food for quite some time now she loves it thank you ,organic dog food , my dog loves them
the auto ship is a terrific way to get hard to find dog food like newman i can t find it in my area at all and it is all my elderly dog can eat with her ibs and preservative sensitivities br easy and cost effective i only with the co footprint on having it to be shipped and am working on finding an for that ,awesome product , great product
i feed my year old toy breed this food and she has not complained yet was feeding her eukanuba her whole life before the dog food scare switched then to only organic brands like wellness this product has been the best deal on organic dog food i have found and with the subscribe and save perfect ,great option for organic dog food , my dog loves it
this is a great product very comforting for owners that it is all natural and mostly organic with no by products and preservatives br br we gave our dog a year old lab mix before after the transition it took a couple of days for her to get used to it but once she did she loves it my dog is quite picky about her food and she likes junk food better rather than wholesome food and treats of course she is very used to newman own now and it gives her very good bowl movement always a plus ,very good natural dog food , my dog loves them
i adopted a rescue dog who had an allergy to corn i checked every bag in local stores but all main fillers were corn i thought i would have to drive to nearest pet store mile round trip to find a corn free dog food then i found this brand on amazon which listed all the no corn my dog loves it so much i even use it as a trick when training her i will be buying again and again ,dog loves it , my dog loves them
my dog never met a meal she did not love including this one the price is very good especially the subscription option i make of the food i feed my dog it is very easy and economical and the best way to control the quality ,good dog food , my dog loves these
very high quality food that my dog will actually eat always ships promptly and well packaged ,organic dog food , great product
i have always given my dog what i thought was high quality dog food since she was a puppy after the pet food issues of a few years ago i switched to only organic dog food for her since she is only lbs the price difference is not too bad i am a free which is not ideal but means my dog basically has access to food any time she wants it because of this she only gets really excited when people food is offered to her well when i open this bag she comes over and eats asap good enough for me ,my dog loves it , my dog loves it
this food might have great contents but my lb yr old poodle does not like the taste she is not a picky eater ,dog does not like it , my dog loves it
not feeling well today and having to go to grocery store but the one thing i cannot do without is dog food love my dogs low and behold the door bell and it was like heard me i cannot believe how quickly my order came i was so happy i posted on and text to my mother thank you amazon thank you prime ,so happy , dog loves it
based on the great reviews from everyone about their picky dogs loving it and always eating it i figured my picky dog would enjoy it as well the price for the amount is also very good considering it is all organic but sadly my dog hates it she smells it and walks away and when i try to hide the food she finds her way to eat around this food i wont be buying it again but i really wished my dog enjoyed it so i could continue to support this brand ,i wish my dog liked it , my dog loves it
i tried many different types of dry food for my picky eater a king charles spaniel when i found the newmans own i hit gold my dog loves it he licks his bowl clean and best of all it is good for him his coat looks very healthy and his stomach issues are controlled i am really happy with this brand i wish it was available at more stores ,my picky dog loves it , my dog loves it
i have started buying a lot of organic food over the past year and it on me that perhaps my dog should be eating more also when i look at the list of ingredients on regular dog food it is i bought some of this newman own and my dog loves it she usually gobbles it up the minute i put it into the bowl ,delicious and healthy , my dog loves these
i expected newman own dog food to be great it may be very nutritious but my little terriers told me we are not eating this stuff period no way after days they sniffed their bowls and walked away so i ordered another organic dog food natural balance organics and it came today so half old half new by the book and they picked out the new stuff and left the newman in the bowl go figure just thought some of you might like to know i am switching them from iams to something much healthier and i finally think i have a match but it is not newman ,dogs to eat it , great product
this large bag of dry pet food is highly recommended for you adult dog it is also worth purchasing this larger sized bag or get two of them at once in order to stock up on this food for a greater length of time ,excellent dog food , great product
my dogs love it even the little princess terrier i have tried many other brands and they enjoy this one the most as so far ,dogs it down , my dog loves them
fast delivery product arrived exactly as described would purchase again from this company ,own organic dog food , great product
i believe that dog food should be what your dog likes to start with br br next i think that you should do research to make sure it is right for br br your pooch all human grade products go into the dog food another br br decision is the size and for lbs a pound bag is perfect buying br br at amazon is a great way to buy because they have the ,great dog food for my dog , my dog loves it
if you are looking for an actual organic dog food newman own is not the way to go i purchased this thinking it was what it claimed on the front package only to read the ingredient list to find out that basically everything else but the chicken was organic with all of the drugs and hormones fed to raised food animals this ingredient is the most important one that should be organic ,brand name , great product
i a little after reading the ingredient list way too much grains and not enough quality protein for our dogs notice all of them are at the beginning which means they make up quite a bit of the diet soy protein is included but some dogs do not do well with soy mine and meat should be the protein source in dog food not grains br not recommended for your ones ,not good enough , my dog loves it
i rotate between newmans nature balance and organic dog food my dog eat all three so cannot say which is better my main reason to purchase this brand or any newman product is for the charity the profits goes to my way of supporting companies that give back ,great product and a great , my dog loves it
i signed up for the monthly subscription for this item the price is great especially without having to pay shipping charges i love the fact that i can manage the subscription by skipping a month or ordering it earlier than scheduled amazon has been excellent getting my shipments out on a timely manner a href http www amazon com gp product b c newman own organics adult dog food chicken rice formula pound bag a very pleased with all my orders from amazon extremely pleased with their customer service thanks amazon ,healthy food the dogs love , great product
i purchased two bags of this dogfood after one week of feeding the newman brand my dog started vomiting after eating she had gas all the time and around due to stomach ache after having her checked for a stomach disorder i took her off the newman dogfood and the symptoms disappeared br i have sent three emails to newman dogfood website no or phone number not available the dogfood is expensive and the customer service is non ,non customer service , great product
just signed up for the subscribe and save option saved a few bucks per bag versus the local store and now it will show up every month hopefully the will match the consumption rate of my two dogs the shipping is month but you can trigger an immediate delivery if needed ,and save option is a good deal , my dog loves it
i do not know why this got such good reviews but my really does not like it he likes iams more than this and it is cheaper ,do not know why , good
i feed my dog royal brand which i typically have to mix with chicken stick or wet canned food for her to eat i thought this stuff would be more flavorful and easy to serve upon opening i could tell i made a mistake smells like cardboard my dog will not eat it no matter how i it up much less could i get her to eat it plain plus it has none of the science behind it like higher end brands like royal the newman brand is spreading itself too thin here they should stick with pasta sauce ,food , my dog loves it
i had to pick up a grocery store brand after running out of our regular innova dog food i fed this to my lb dog for a week and could not believe the amount of waste this brand produced he was going up to times a day unbelievable this just goes to show how much filler is in this food would never recommend ,horrible , my dog loves it
this food is organic sure however look at the ingredients top includes chicken meal never feed your pet anything with chicken meal or chicken by product it is a cheap substitute and really is bad for the dog i suggest a brand like evo blue buffalo ect no ingredient should be meal or by product ,do not be , my dog loves it
i guess my animals cat and dog cannot read the names on bag as they almost refuse to eat this stuff unless nothing else available and they are hungry ,much better , my cat loves it
i have dogs and all were sick on this food one actually almost died it had to be after i spent on vet bills i decided to call the fda to this food they found on it a pesticide i just want to make sure if someone out there has the same problem that it must be known i am still not happy about this i decided not to it any longer but i still feel people should know these organic companies cannot get away misleading people if everyone exposed them then this would be a better world think about it br br a href http www amazon com gp product b g newman own organics chicken rice advanced dry pound a ,how can something organic have in it , great product
chicken meal br not allowed in human food br br subject to only the less animal food safety standards br may contain d chicken products br chickens br chickens that were dying prior to br chickens that were dead prior to br disabled chickens may carry more infections br br may contain waste products br restaurant waste br meat processing facility waste br waste br not subject to testing for quality standards or nutrient levels may vary widely from batch to batch ,about chicken meal , not as good as it is
the number one ingredient is chicken not organic chicken just the hormone junk you would not eat yourself i will stick to natural balance which is sold here on amazon as well ,not so dont be by the organics in the name , good but not great
i put this in my dogs bowl and the first time my dog bob just licked the bowl clean same ol same ol then i put in some and he turned green good results the next day his eyes to and when i took him for his daily he looked at the neighbors cat and it and good results br i think i will try some my i have a few people that the world t need ,a light of for your dog , my dog loves it
i will never again even consider a dog food with corn wheat or soy in it grain has no place in a dog diet ,do not in dog food , great product
i have to say in the beginning i have not tried this food it had me sold i said oh boy its made by paul newman it has to be good this should not be organic its it should be advertized as partially organic then you wont be upset that the most important thing you want to be organic the meat is not who cares if your veggies r organic well it helps def but they dont normally raise veggies with antibiotics etc etc br so if organic is what looking for walk up the aisle to castor and pollux organix dog food every single ingrediant is o r g a n i c br shame on you the company of one of my fav im truly surprised he let this be under the reviews of organic ,disappointed , not as good as it is
it with my two year old american pit bull terrier another love of my life also on this food has the most beautiful shiny coat ever and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is i do spoil my fur kids but their health and well being is my number one i have just recently switched over feeding my cats newman own cat food both dry and canned food and since then i have noticed the difference in the of hair balls i know that i am truly a pet lover but i believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them unnecessary medical issues and all around good health a good balanced safe natural food is the way to go i highly recommend newman own dog and cat food i also feed my two dogs newman own biscuits as treats ,newman own organics dog food , great dog food
crazy about newman dog food when i switched her to it but if you think about how people react to a healthy diet in the beginning it makes sense it takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there br br it has been almost a year my dog is and healthy and almost allergy free she gets dry newman fed free style and ounces of newman canned every day her weight stays stable at pounds which is perfect for her her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week br br on another note this diet has made duty much easier she never vomits anymore her is always firm making her easy to clean up after she is regular as clock work all these make it more enjoyable to be a dog owner ,give it time , great for the price
our dog is years old and for the last couple of years his stomach has become particularly sensitive we tried various brands of dog food before settling on newman own our dog loves it and has not had any more trouble with his stomach it is hard to find though i was buying it from a small local organic grocery store but they only carried it in the smallest size and i was paying almost twice as much as on amazon now i have it set up on amazon to ship monthly ,newman own organics dog food , my dog loves it
allergies she was day and night with itching after trying endless other to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities so we decided to go organic all her deals cleared up once we started the newman however after giving glowing reviews for many years we now have to something has changed our little jack itching returned to the point of blood it is clear something changed and i believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was we are on the hunt again i am not saying it does not have good quality ingredients but if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitive this likely is not for you too bad it once was a superior product ,something has changed quality control must have as far as organic goes , not as good as the price
dog eating it but she has to be hungry to eat this without doctoring my vet does not want me feeding her people food so i add some of newman or happy hips canned to it br br i ve talked to a couple of vets about prescription diet and they all push the big company brand names the common appears to be the soy used in newman to increase the protein count br br i am willing to put a little flavor in this to feed may dog high quality social responsible food br br i may be the only person who has made the following mistake but assuming you catch the amazon sales make sure you are ordering the bag size you want i thought i was getting a good price on one order until the food came and it was the seven instead of twelve pound bag ,good product but , great product
br a couple of the reports from reviewers originally scared me about the reports of scratching which was exactly the problem i had with other dog foods i gave it a try and my husky has never had a problem since and she has been on it for almost three months now my husky has always had problems with digestive issues and this seems to be one dog food that she likes and does not have problems with br br on a side note i wish newman offered a bigger size bag i have to order these all the time due to the pound bag my husky kills a bag in roughly two weeks due to her size it still works out being cheaper than the bag of pound i d i was ordering so i am still happy with it science diet was sending me to the poor house ,great dog food for dogs with problems , dog loves it
and newman own at first and gradually more newmans own in the mix until finally n o ever since switching about six weeks ago he has not had constipation or loose stools i also do not hear his tummy after meals like before and despite what a few reviewers have written the chicken and beef used in the pet food while not organic is natural and raised without hormones and antibiotics br br according to ingredients list natural chicken raised without growth hormones and antibiotics and fed only a natural all vegetable diet the chicken meat provides amino acids essential for muscles hormones enzymes and and protective also the beef is free range range fed w no hormones antibiotics br br for me the evidence is clear this is good quality food my dog loves it and i love that when i buy newman own products the go to charity ,great product no or in the , great product
from the shelter where she was on science diet she had a ton of skin issues formerly had of bare skin itchy dry skin and dandruff flakes since we changed over to newman the skin problems have almost gone away it is been about months and she has her fur growing back in the problem areas she has less dandruff and i have noticed a lot less scratching from her in general our dog said it was most likely due to the change in diet br br her are solid and very regular they are also not particularly smelly i have never smelled any gas from her since putting her on the food these are all signs that she is on a great diet br br also i love the subscribe feature because i do not have to heavy bags of dog food from my car to my rd floor ,our dog issues , great for
last when my latest subscribe and save bag was opened my dog started throwing up during the night after eating from this new bag on the first night i figured she would eaten something bad off the street on the second night i figured it was the lingering effects of eating something bad off the street on the third night i started looking for other causes for the and i realized that the vomiting had started on the same day as we would started the new bag i stopped feeding the dog the newman own and the vomiting stopped for nights last night i fed her the food again and sure enough she threw up in the night br br i trusted and liked this food and all things under the newman own brand but i will never buy their products again they clearly have a dangerous quality control problem ,bad batch made my dog sick , my dog loves it
we have a pug that suffers from chronic ear infections and skin problems we have consistently kept him on expensive brands that are well known for having good ingredients like california natural chicken soup for the dog lover soul royal canin and a couple others that i cannot remember off the top of my head br br my mom picked up this newman food because it was available at the grocery store they love the food but what really me is that his ears and skin have improved his stools are also much firmer and way less stinky than before this food seems like a real winner for us ,this food is well for our allergy , my dog loves them
since we began using this several years ago our senior dogs need to visit the vet when we were feeding a well know premium brand we were there at least time every six weeks they love the taste of newmans it keeps their tummy in tip top shape no more food no more vomiting made with chicken the same chicken sold at whole foods other organic food sellers if its good enough for you it is good enough for them all mr newmans profits go to animal shelter and rescue organization give this food weeks see the yourself ,the best organic food you can your , great product
i really want to like this product because of the great things newman have done and the fact that all the go to charity i like the fact that the ingredients are all top quality and organic it looks and smells good too unfortunately none of this matters to my dog she just does not care for it usually she will sniff it and walk away once she nothing else is coming her way she will usually eat it but i feel bad since she obviously does not care for it like i said i really want to like this product but my dog has the final say sadly i do not think i will buy it again ,my dog is not impressed , my dog loves these
our cocker spaniel is now nearly years old and the solid gold food i would been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago with no notice on the packaging and he became subject to stomach upsets after the contaminated food scare even tho solid gold was not recalled i decided to switch and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight newman own is a brand i totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years after a year on this food my dog is doing fine but i do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat that may be age related as well but the stomach upsets have stopped and i feel better knowing i am not him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula ,my over what i our first baby , great for the price
stuck purchasing the ridiculously more expensive small bags then i heard about newman own organics which is rated a better dog food than the breed specific food i was using and cost less and then i discovered that i could buy this food at amazon com have it shipped on a regular basis to my home with no shipping costs and a discount on the food for up for the subscription plan delivery no brainer no more running out of food no more driving miles or more to find it no more br br and best and most importantly of all my little guys love it their stools up almost immediately after starting the they seem more active more alert more regular and they actually chew this food they inhaled their puppy chow without chewing i cannot say enough good things about both newman own and amazon subscription delivery service ,newman own organics dog food , good for my dog
same undesirable chicken parts as the cheaper dog foods i was not happy i contacted newman about whether the products in this food are sourced from the u s and i was told by one of their that they are recently i moved and was unable to get newman locally so i tried a couple other organic brands my dog did not like them and she seemed to have a larger stool i decided to go back to newman and order from amazon who i can always count on to carry everything now she is happy and so am i and we are supporting a great cause because newman does not compromise on quality and also what more could you ask br br one important thing to consider if you have a senior dog it is important to feed them the senior formula so they can digest the food easier ,this is the best dog food out there , great for
i had been buying all sorts of super premium super expensive foods my local stores kept discontinuing them so i did my research and found newman own organic br br it is certified organic with no hormones antibiotics or chemical additives corn or wheat br br and my dogs love it of course they eat anything including grass and bird food and several to post on line ,great dog food , my dog loves it
this food is a vast improvement over the store bought crap my dog coat got softer within days his breath stopped immediately and he smells a lot better he is more active and seems healthier and happier no more plant floor for my dog a month is a small sacrifice to make for my dog health and well being i honestly do not know why everyone is not more concerned about what kind of inedible junk they put in regular store bought dog food ,away store bought , my dog loves these
one of my dogs had bowel syndrome which we tried to address with food from the vet raw food and every kind of dog food in a pet store a friend told me about newmans and how it cleared up her dog stomach problems one day later firm stools no gas happy dog ecstatic dog parents my other dog is and is often mistaken for a puppy due to her good energy and coat i am so glad we found this food ,newman dog food is the best , my dog loves it
both of my dogs had trouble with this formula allergy wise it took me a couple of days to realize that their itching was related to the food needless to say i will not buy this product again ,i will not purchase again , dog loves it
i have given my dogs every expensive dog food there is merrick you name it and even though they were good this one is the best no upset tummies during the switch to this dog food either even my senior dog who always has loose stool now has a firm healthy stool plus newman own gives all their profits to charity so it really is the best as far as i am concerned ,best dog food on the market , great product
this dog food is not exactly cheap so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising this whole thing needs to be better if someone uses the word organic in their description it better be organic otherwise the consumer is being which is unfortunate newmans has a great reputation i buy a lot of their products but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me buying anything from them in the future br br on the positive side my dog loved it she would lick the bowl around the room for minutes after the last morsel was consumed i have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good it is like the crack of dog food she has never been a finicky eater she will pretty much eat anything but this stuff really her world too bad she is not getting any more of it ,i agree with the the name is , my dog loves it
my foster dog came to me severely with nutrient and digestive issues after a few weeks of prescription food i him into newman own advanced formula not only does he love it but he is gaining weight and it easily it was recommended by many and has minimal to no fillers br br personally i enjoy the product because as a life long vegetarian it was important to find a food with strict animal practices and newman own apparently has those it is affordable as well sticking with it ,nice organic free option for sensitive stomach , my dog loves it
really really with this product he rarely gets sick eats almost every meal we give him though sometimes he makes us wait for him to finish his breakfast but that is okay with other dog food products he would stop eating them completely or get sick frequently even the expensive brands we tried from the animal hospital br br at first the only place we could buy newman own was from a local owned pet store which was very expensive but worth it since he stopped getting sick so frequently i was delighted to buy it on amazon the price for the lb bag is slightly more than what we were paying for the lb bag locally i am a prime member so was able to get this without paying for shipping i will certainly order it again when we get close to running out br br thank you amazon ,best dog food ever , great product
my dogs love this food i have fed my year old german shepard and my three year old american pit bull terrier for almost three years they have thrived so well on this food my shepard no longer has stomach problems both their coats are beautiful and i am completely satisfied when i decided to switch foods i did alot of research on what good healthy mostly organic food to switch them to i chose newman own not because i could purchase it easily at a local store because i can not do so i have to order it and have it delivered but because of the ingredients how it is made and because most of the go to i found the best price at amazon and will always order it this way i truly recommend this dog food to everyone ,best dog food ever , my dog loves it
i have not tried this product personally but my dog has and he loves it and is well he is getting a bit grey but is as as he ever was years ago ,dog loves it , dog loves it
have two cocker br it was a challenge to find the right dog food for br the older one as he would get very gassy i tried br at least different brands with no success then br another cocker spaniel owner recommended me this one br no more gas br both of them love it their coat is looking so much br shinier and healthier and they now shed very less br i would feed my dogs anything else now br very highly recommended br and the price and service from amazon is unbeatable ,just what my dog needed , great product
our dog has always been a little on the lazy side and his coat has been fairly unhealthy looking relative to other dogs we have had in the past when he began to start smelling on top of it we decided to change his dog food to see if perhaps his stomach was becoming upset by his current food br br after about a week on the new food he had noticeably more energy and his coat started to become much healthier on top of that the odor that he started to until it was no longer there br br we really did not expect it to be so drastic we are very happy with newman own dog food ,you can a difference in your dog quality of life , my dog loves it
and one of them one food allergies that had caused severe problems after trying several foods and making all my own dog food we tried paul newman and all was well maggie and her friends thrived well our grocery stores did not always have it in stock and it ranged from to dollars for pounds also at wal mart is was past its expiration date and rancid thank you amazon it comes fresh it is so reasonably priced and it gets delivered on schedule which i can change at anytime as far as amount and delivery date i cannot thank you enough for carrying this food nor recommend it enough for other dogs our lives are busy i am a nurse and anything that is dependable easy reasonable comes with excellent customer service and my friends maggie and honey stay healthy on it a gift for every day thank you ,they are not sick , great for the price
i was a little skeptical about switching over to this brand but i am happy to say my dog loves this stuff i do not even need to add leftover meat or gravy sauce like i did to his old food this stuff is way better than the crap they sell at those chain stores cannot beat the price with s s also love that they come in smaller resealable bags which keeps the food fresh better to open up a brand new bag every couple weeks than to leave a huge opened bag of kibble in the pantry for months ,so far so good , great product
prior to switching to newman own organics dog food my year old shih tzu was crunching on iams which was fine except that every months or so he would have stomach problems after switching his poops have been firmer no stomach issues in sight and his coat has gotten and much less flaky duncan likes his new food and so do i ,newman my dog , my dog loves it
my cocker puppy mos threw up castor and and natural balance and had loose so i tried this and he did great even the red from his eyes have almost cleared up after a month along with eye drops which is great ,the best , great product
i like newman own for my family due to its consistent quality and good ingredients i like have the opportunity to provide the same quality products to my animals amazon makes it convenient to get multiple bags in sizes that appear on my front according to my schedule i got the three four pound bags talk about portability and ,dog loves food we like , great product
my new yorkie came from a puppy mill she was clean and well she was not ever in a house when i got her home she was so scared and nervous from the strange she would not eat or drink and had horrible watery bowel movements after a visit to the vet that showed no we put on the bland diet i researched organic dog food and was very impressed with the reviews of this food no one in my area pa has this product i sent for it and weaned her off the bland diet after only two days on this food her poops are solid small and firm i am so thankful she is really doing well and she is a very sweet girl and looks at me with grateful brown eyes ,had terrible , not as good as the
dogs love the taste and i love the company especially convenient to have it delivered rather than me it home ,quality organic dog food , my dog loves them

i have been feeding this to my standard poodle for quite some time it was recommended by a local dog day care training center called great dog shoppe in seattle they are very specific about which foods they suggest and sell it must meet certain standards of nutrition or it is no go my poodle loves it but even better i offered some to my finicky poodle who just does not eat when she is away from home she gobbled it right up and asked for more when i compared the contents of newman to her brand which was suggested by a breeder there was no comparison newman own is far superior i get it via subscribe and save so i never run out i save over the store price and it is delivered right to my door what could be easier ,yummy even for dog , my dog loves them
i used to buy this at a local health food store and then they stopped carrying it then i was thrilled when i found it wal mart but then they stopped stocking the dry kibble and now only carry the newman doggie mush in cans so i could not believe it when i found it here amazon really does sell just about everything my shih like it and they do not get sick at all like they did on the non organic but still expensive vet recommended brands ,dogs like it i love that amazon it , great product

i like most people switched to organic after the dog food scare and after trying a lot of different foods settled on this one my dogs like it and i feel good about it feeding it to them ,this is the one , great product
after having lost one to an verified case of poisoning from the healthy nutritious dog food we were buying and feeding him this was not cheap food folks this was a well known brand highly marketed as natural that we were paying bag for the fda analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins but nothing was done to the dog food manufacturer they are still producing their high priced waste and heavily marketing it as natural br br my advice to pet owners read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often blue buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence because it does not contain any cheap fillers it is more satisfying to your dog so you do not need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical do not wait until it is too late for your beloved pet ,not what i thought , not as good as you are
i have three dogs two of the three would normally eat just about anything that you put in their bowls the third one a yorkie has always been for the past couple years i had been buying those expensive brands of food that promise natural ingredients and better health i decided to try newman own none of my dogs seem to be crazy about this food no to the late mr newman if i mix newman own with another brand the dogs make an effort to pick out eat the other food and they will tend to leave newman own in the bowl if they are hungry and nothing else is available they will eat the newman own i am not here to knock newman own i am simply telling you my experience btw the food is not old it does not smell stale or old ,are my dogs too , my dog loves it
the dogs had been eating purina for a long long time i switched to newman own and i noticed something only a dog owner would be conscious of the waste they no longer foul waste which purina seemed to do to them regularly since they have been on newman their waste is almost and well it is easy to pick up you can tell it is nutritious by what comes out and if you have to pick up after your dog daily like myself you will appreciate the cleaner output ,how you can tell it is great , my dog loves it
my is picky and likes to change up his food once in a while so i decided to try two other brands what a mistake br newman own is really the best my dog looks better feels better and the quality of food is very good do not do like i did and experiment around my poor dogs stomach stick with newmans ,still the best , my dog loves it
i switched to this food from blue buffalo i hate to say it but around the time blue started doing tv commercials the food started my dog stomach perhaps that is a but it was a reason to switch regardless of the timing the newman food has been great my dog loves the food he has been energetic and in great health not much more that you could ask the bag of treats that comes in the lb bag is a fantastic bonus to every bag ,great food , my dog loves it
i rescued my dog a year ago ever since then i have been feeding him newman i like that the main ingredient is a form of meat and there is not a lot of grain type of ingredients all of the ingredients are organic so it is really good for my dog i have tried several other brands with my dog but i do not think he is really allergic to anything or has a for anything in particular and since this is one of the cheaper brands out there that is still nutritious i decided to stick to this brand ordering it on amazon is very convenient because i can use the subscribe save feature and set the schedule of when i want the dog food delivered i never have to worry about running out of dog food ,great dog food , great for the price
this solved my pups dog food allergy problems when i started purchasing it i have a husky and a german shepherd but several months ago the itching started again the color and size of the kibble even noticeably changed i wrote a letter of inquiry to newman with batch numbers from the bags but have received no answer since then i have purchased both solid gold wolf king and royal german shepherd and the dogs are doing okay again ,not as good as it used to be , great product

newman own has been an excellent choice for my dog the ingredients are organic and high quality her coat is beautifully and she has never had an allergic response as with some of the more expensive products from the vet office also she is a small dog and the kibble bits are easy for her to chew it was annoying that the price was reduced between the time of my order and the delivery but amazon made an immediate i like the pound bags for freshness because my dog is small and takes awhile to eat that much but there are other sizes available to suit larger dogs ,first dog food , my dog loves it
would help with his stomach issues and finally found another brand of dog food that while not organic helped relieve the gas problem br after finishing a bag of the old brand i stumbled across this on amazon one cold day and thought i would take a chance and see if he would like it or not i am happy to report that he loves it and it does not give him horrible gas at all his coat is shiny and healthy as well the only downside i can see like the other brand is the price but being that the product is high quality and organic i cannot argue that too much plus with amazon subscribe and save i get it at a discount and delivered right to my front door you definitely cannot beat that br overall i am very satisfied with this and will continue to purchase ,my dog loves it , great product

my dog loves this food i really like that it is organic especially with all the recent problems with other dog foods i will continue to buy this brand in the store i would rate the product as a br br the problem i had was with subscribe and save i started out buying at a very decent price after only months the subscription price had increased by almost no notice on the increase was sent to see if i still wanted it either i believe amazon should send an alert and ask to confirm or cancel when there is an increase my other have not had price increases like this one subscription rating ,do not , my dog loves it

newman own food is one of the best on the market it is a natural healthy food for my senior dog ,product , great product
i am very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it all of my dogs jack and dachshund enjoy newman own dog food and i liked knowing it was organic the kibbles are a perfect size for easy chewing my dogs enjoyed newman own for about months but then only on it so i decided to alternate it each month with another dog food to give my dogs some variety ,my dog liked it but wanted some variety , my dog loves them
researched the company researched the ingredients customer service people are great sent free coupons when e mailed with a question about which of their cat foods best for my two kitties regular or advanced received good answers and not this food is made in the usa with products from the usa and has all the ingredients i think are good for my cats the two of them love love this dry food and i have to it or they would chow day all day i do not leave food out for any pet cat or dog to eat at will they do not like newman canned food however so i do not force it on them ,good stuff , my cat loves it
this gum is amazing the flavor burst in your mouth and it also has a wonderful refreshing sensation br we love it my husband and i ,amazing , great taste
i bought a big pack of this gum the flavor kiwi watermelon is ok but it did not last long i found i would usually pop a new piece in my mouth after about minutes to get another shot of flavor i would not really recommend this gum it is not horrible but not that great either ,meh , not as good as it is
this gum is the worst i have ever purchased plain and simple within two seconds of chewing taste gone ,taste fast , great taste
tastes very good i really like the taste br br but then it is gone like it was never there so br br takes two pieces to really enjoy also br br and be very careful not to eat it seriously it is hard not to swallow it laugh all you want you try it and see what i mean ,yummy but it does not last , not as good as it is
i have never had an allergic reaction to any food or anything else in my life but within seconds of starting to chew a piece of this gum my throat began to burn and my became that is strange because i have been chewing spearmint and peppermint ice cubes for a while now with no reaction i tasted another piece from another pack we get this stuff free at the dining facility here in iraq and again my throat started burning so if you have a history of food allergies you might not want to try this flavor ,i must be , not as good as it is
i am really picky about the gum i chew this is great and the flavor lasts a long time i recommend it ,great gum , great product
this is great cheese a little sharp yet creamy with slight bits of crunchy great with a micro brew the and raspberry are yummy too ,sooo good , great taste
my baby loves this apple sauce he did not like the gerber brand at all but this down right away and i like that it is organic ,yummy , great product
our family loves these tasty and healthy sesame honey almonds by trader joe you get the crunchy flavor of the sesame seeds combined with the subtle sweetness of the honey and almond flavoring wow it a great snack that you feel good while eating it is my favorite of trader joe almond snacks almonds are good for you and a handful of these in the morning with a fruit smoothie or as a snack at lunch is a great way to get protein the healthy fat and the vitamin e that almonds offer it is a good idea to measure out cup of these almonds or count the almonds out to stay in the calorie range you want to keep within nutritionist recommend having a small amount of almonds or walnuts each day for good fat and protein ,tasty and healthy snack , delicious and healthy snack
are you kidding me i buy this all day long at popular wholesale clubs for under no more then at stores watch these prices guys ,way out of cost , great product
i absolutely love this stuff but i pay to for a pack in the grocery store why is this price so high ,why is this price so high , great product
you can get these much cheaper at wholesale clubs br br i get the oz yes oz for or its actually even cheaper then buying the bottles from the regular store ,the other is totally right , great product
i lived down in for years and community coffee is what you were served when you asked for a cup of coffee here in i cannot buy the coffee so when i saw the ad to order through amazon i jumped at the offer i got bags of the and i am in coffee heaven right now thanks amazon ,my coffee , great coffee
as dunkin kirkland and various other store brands i came across a great deal on a pack of community coffee so i decided to try it the packaging is not the best once you open it but i have separate air tight containers which i use as i imagine most coffee drinkers would own br br i prefer dark bolder roasts and i found that community coffee definitely fit the bill my girlfriend did not like it claiming it was too strong which further my belief that it was at the right level for me i brew the coffee the traditional way coffee pot but also via cold brewing i have found that the cold brewed version of community coffee far surpasses the traditional heat brewing product i am not quite sure if this is the case for almost all coffees but it seems even more pronounced with community coffee ,inexpensive but great when cold , not as good as i be
this coffee was good but it had a distinctive aroma and taste like movie theater popcorn i am a huge hazelnut flavored coffee fan and this was good it just does not typically taste like hazelnut you may like it but i will search for a more true hazelnut flavor do a test make popcorn in the microwave and then later make the coffee and you will see the ,hazelnut coffee smells and tastes like popcorn not as much like hazelnut , best coffee ever
hazelnut coffee is my favorite and our local stores do not carry it as we live in a very small town the flavor and taste of this coffee is wonderful i start every day with it and often have an afternoon treat of a cup of the coffee i will buy again and highly recommend far earlier than i anticipated ,great flavor , great coffee
awesome coffee i have ordered this pack of bags twice now and getting ready to order a third if you like dunkin donuts hazelnut but do not like the price this is a great and inexpensive alternative ,excellent , good coffee
we first discovered community coffee while on a visit to lake charles la and until recently it was only available in la or by mail we the hazelnut blend it has a nice rich flavor without being overly strong this is very good coffee we like it and have a standing order with amazon to have it shipped to us at convenient ,we like it you will too , great coffee
i am not a coffee snob so i am not picky about what kind of coffee i purchase i chose this because it was cheapest by the ounce and best rated i bought a href http www amazon com gp product b eo the coffee bean tea leaf hand roasted hazelnut ground coffee ounce bags pack of a as my first ground coffee and i have to say community coffee smells and tastes better than coffee bean this is totally personal preference though br br this community coffee ground tastes much darker and smoother and it smells good ,taste good to me , not as good as i be
i am no coffee snob but this is still much better than crap you get a starbucks i drink black coffee so flavor really matters when its not covered by caramel and other junk great coffee for a great price especially if you get it when amazon is offering the off coupon ,great coffee for a great price , good coffee
i do not drink hazelnut coffee but my wife says this is the best she has ever had and asked me to buy more for her ,great coffee , best coffee ever
we enjoy community coffee when we go to new orleans i was glad to see it available in your online store ,coffee , great coffee
a better priced coffee plus more importantly the price so far is still excellent all the others are ridiculous on pricing i have noticed by or in some cases i was getting maxwell house hazelnut but this coffee is much tastier and maxwell house has gotten way too pricey for the quality of their hazelnut after experiencing community bolder flavored hazelnut you can actually taste hazelnut in community coffee it is a bit bolder but i like a good cup of coffee where you can actually taste the coffee yeah i do not buy or search for maxwell house any longer nor do i enjoy folgers or any of the much more expensive brands as none of them compare to the rich flavor of community hazelnut coffee i just hope that now finally after finding a decent tasting coffee at a good price amazon keeps it in stock for awhile ,hazelnut coffee , not for me
it is not the best but for the money and that extra off its the best value you can get i am very happy with my purchase and now i can drink good coffee everyday as opposed to the crap office coffee or that once a month expensive coffee after buying this i was satisfied enough to buy another pack of cafe special note the expiration dates on my hazelnut bags are ,good coffee , good coffee
i gave this a try when it was on special and i totally love this product iam as fussy coffee drinker this product is just a lovely as those higher priced coffee that tend to break my bank account give it a try ,coffee loves this , great taste
my husband and i both like coffee with rich flavor and good taste but we do not like the bitter or burnt taste some coffees have this community hazelnut has excellent flavor we make it fairly strong and are very pleased with this coffee ,excellent taste , good coffee
not the best coffee but it is not bad as well we bought more after we tried the first time because for the price we have got it is fine godiva is still our favorite but this one is okay too ,ok for the price , great coffee
i hated this coffee i am much more of a starbucks or peet so maybe i am a bit spoiled but after reading many positive reviews of this company i decided to give it a try big mistake i had a hard time giving it away it definitely tastes like chicory bad news ,worst coffee ever , not as good as it is
meat by products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested we are talking beaks chicken feet eyeballs even chicken poop i would not recommend this product to anyone for any reason ever it is an absolutely awful dog food i cannot believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising br br i recommend to stay far away from beneful and most purina products when purchasing a dog or cat food the most important thing to consider is the first ingredients just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself now that i know what to look for i usually buy my pets all natural organic foods such as blue buffalo halo or wellness ,false terrible dog food , dog loves it
this candy has gotten harder and harder to find it was down to a couple stores in my area that sold it and they stopped now a year later i in toffifay into and up pops amazon great price for a great candy and i am well stocked up for the next months the hard part is not eating it all the first week ,glad to have it again , great product
i have been looking for this candy for over a year i used to enjoy this as a young kid and now its back all there is to say is yummy ,yummy , great taste
i heard my kids talking about candy they remembered from childhood and they mentioned toffifay so i checked amazon to see if it was still being sold it was and reasonably priced i ordered a pack and it among their christmas they were really surprised and happy to find it christmas morning i m glad i thought of searching amazon ,good buy , good but not great
i thought this would be the perfect i love hazel nuts i love caramel and i love chocolate but there is something about the chocolate filling that i do not like br they claim a whole hazel nut in each piece but it is probably only half it is an ok candy but i will never ever buy it again i will stick to snickers with almonds ,just ok , not as good as it is
i have been experimenting with k cup brews for almost years now i tried timothy only because it was on sale and i was still looking for the one well i finally found it is the best breakfast coffee i have found to date rich full bodied with a clean non acrid finish it goes well with milk and splenda no odd aftertaste whatsoever donut shop is my favorite over ice newman nantucket is my favorite bold timothy italian goes best with dessert and is the first thing i drink every morning ,full flavor non acidic best k cup so far , great coffee
very weak blend slightly bitter aftertaste noticeably light brew when brewing will not purchase again in fact i regret this purchase even on oz brew still really weak taste ,very weak , not as good as it is
i have tried many different brands and flavors of k cup coffees and i have to say this one is one of the best i have ever had i would strongly recommend it it is very hard to find so buy it if you can get it at a good price ,best medium roast coffee , great taste
this coffee is bold dark and tasty unlike many other types that are too watery and weak this one brews nice and strong cup of coffee ,best coffee for k cups , great coffee
this is by far the best decaf i have ever tried you cannot brew it on the large cup setting you have to brew it on the oz setting do not try to stretch it to the oz or it will be too weak however when brewed at oz this is smooth tasty and tastes like coffee not bitter and you cannot tell it is a decaf ,best decaf ever , not as good as it is
i am from and i was looking for a coffee that tasted like back home everyday when i make coffee and the aroma is in the whole kitchen it feels like home and it tastes just like it i love this coffee ,like a good coffee , great coffee
we have been experimenting with different brands of k cups since we purchased our keurig last christmas while this one was okay it just is not as good green mountain breakfast blend for an everyday staple we have not tried green mountain columbian yet as a closer comparison however when we make a larger cup of coffee with this one the brew is weaker than with gm breakfast blend br br also please note that we love timothy world italian blend it is definitely amount our favorites ,not our favorite , not good
we love this medium full flavored roast very smooth taste no bitter or acidic taste at all excellent coffee good value also try timothy kona very good also ,wonderful coffee , great coffee
my husband has been taking this sinus buster tea once a day before bedtime for about months already he usually had a real bad sinus problem before but now it is almost completely gone this tea is so wonderful and it really helps when he for a few days because ran out of it then the sinus came back again do not want to skip it for so long anymore highly recommended ,real sinus , great tea
the sinus buster tea had an interesting aroma when seeping it is taste is acquired not at least to say more like burnt bark or really coffee i had no of my sinuses while drinking one cup of the tea the next morning i could feel relief of pressure and pain i would prefer this product over any inhaled sinus relief agent as a plus all the ingredients of the tea are on the package in english nothing unknown ,interesting taste of sinus , not as good as i be
i found this tea by accident but it worked so well that i later ordered it br br after not being able to find it again it really helps open nasal br br since starting to use it whenever i have bad nasal congestion i have not br br had a sinus infection everyone is different but it sure worked for me ,sinus help , great tea
i used it for a sinus infection where i lost my voice completely and had a sore throat i found this product on and went to an herbal asian store in in i only paid the only difference is that i did not get tea bags they were cubes you place in the hot water it worked great it took a few hours to work but it worked the next day i had my voice back completely and no sore throat one night i up from terrible post nasal drip cough took a cup of this tea and it eliminated the cough and put me right to sleep a must buy its cheap and natural you cant go wrong if you give it a try ,great stuff , great tea
its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed i do not particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different this is the first thing other than sudafed to actually work i have not tried it during a sinus migraine yet but for moderate congestion it works wonders smells a bit off but the taste is just fine make sure to it for mins or it will not work give it about mins to kick in seems to last for no side affects that i can tell so glad to be rid of the heart side affect and dry mouth sore throat that comes with sudafed it works great paired with a sinus rinse or pot ,this product works , not as good as it is
i love this tea seriously my mom and i suffer very bad with sinus problems and we heard about this tea called sinus we just had to see what all the talk was about you know it is a very good tea that takes your away and make you sleep great ,sinus , great tea
after reading all the great reviews i ordered some of this tea i have had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of with little success unfortunately this really did not do anything for me the taste is ok bearable but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion so far the only things i have found that have helped me somewhat are the personal warm mist and ,did not work for me , not as good as it is
i have been suffering from post nasal drip and congestion for so many years and this tea made such a big difference after a couple of days i drink it times per day and i feel so much better i can breathe easier and have little or no post nasal drip throughout the day ,this tea works i feel so much better , great tea
not sure exactly what is in it but it really helps my sinus condition a family member who spent time in china said it tasted like other healing herbs she had had while there the taste is earthy and takes some getting used to but it is worth it ,it really helps , not as good as it is
this tea did not do anything steal have issues with itching throat ear and everything else but i do enjoy the smell of it ill say it last up to a few hours and that is it ,did not do nothing , great tea
it seems to help but i cannot tell whether or not it works any better than domestic teas that tout similar claims yogi breathe deep and cold buster celestial sleepytime sinus and other herbal i have brewed it double strong to try and gain the greatest effect and again it seems to work but nothing amazing the taste is a little bitter but i suppose that is a fairly reasonable indicator it has beneficial in it all in all i am likely to stick with the less exotic teas that i can buy at the grocery store as an aside i find celestial sweet and spicy herbal mix to have probably the best effect out of all the teas i have tried though it is not at all marketed as something for this purpose if you read everything they put in it though it makes sense that it would help ,hard to , good product but
i had high hopes when i purchased this produce shipping was amazingly fast and i have tried it a few times i do not enjoy the taste and since i do not sweeten my tea it was not that great and it did nothing for my sinuses will not purchase again but i do recommend the seller ,did not work for me , not as good as it is
i bought this tea during a major sinus infection which included headache i drink multiple cups over a few days and am sad to report it had absolutely no effect taste is so so but that is not really what matters as every sinus knows if eating dirt would make the pain go away we would eat dirt ,no for this sinus , not as good as it is
i am having to change my original post on this tea my husband and i both suffer from sinus problems i made up a big tea pot with tea bags and let it steep for minutes i had cups and my husband had one neither of us noticed any difference with our sinuses a few days later i decided to try the tea again i brewed one cup of tea with one tea bag i let it sit again for several minutes i guess the first time i tried it i did not make it strong enough this time i noticed a difference as my sinuses are a little ,have to make the tea strong , great tea
i used to take sudafed for my nose i tried this tea and felt relief immediately i usually drink this tea twice a week and have not yet felt the nose would highly recommend ,very effective tea , great tea
i bought this tea based upon some research i had done into the ingredients and by reading the reviews posted here this tea has a wonderful flavor and smell i have enjoyed it very much and it helps me at bedtime with my sinus issues great stuff ,wonderful , great tea
i am so please that i was able to get the tea from amazon i was pleased with the service sinus buster herbal tea is very helpful and it gives me great relief with my allergy br br i have been suffered with allergy for the past years or more first time i find a medication which is natural and no side affects compare to other medication for allergy br br i discovered the tea at a farm market in pa on a ride with my at first i was hesitated to purchase the tea but who was in the same but i was told me to buy the tea because she used it a year ago and got great relief from it with her allergy br br thanks br br ,sinus , great tea
but a told me to take this vitamin d vitamin c and something he mixed and i got better from a month sinus issue ,i was , not as good as it
we love sinus buster tea my husband thinks it is great and out his sinus regularly ,sinus tea , great tea
i have ordered numerous teas and other but have never had a lack of product in an order that was sealed the tea bag wrapping in question was sealed without a tea bag inside i would have said something sooner however i only tried these when i had a sinus infection and the last times i tried to use one the sealed pouch was empty beware ,i had tea bags beware , great tea
i absolutely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from sinus headaches my brother had given me a couple of bags to try a few months ago in the past i have had serious sinus headaches after drinking this tea my headaches were gone and the in my had i was so relieved i have recently drank this tea for a dry cough big mistake it gave me a sore throat as well as other issues i will never drink it for the common cold symptoms love this product though ,recommend this product , great product
all natural beef but too soft for my taste does not have the snap and drier outer surface that some like this is a matter of personal taste the product is good just not for everyone br i suggest trying this company old fashioned cold smoked beef sticks strong hickory flavor a good bite of spice and drier texture br this company has superb customer service ,with some not me , not as good as it is
buffalo bills lbs hot short shots br br the first two short shots are very similar to slim jim just not individually wrapped i just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on about a quarter pound per bag br br buffalo bills lb extra br these are very smokey but a little too dry for my taste br br buffalo bills oz premium hickory beef jerky pieces random size br taste great if you are a jerky lover br br buffalo bills lb pepperoni short shots br probably the closest to slim jim of all the short shots br br buffalo bills lbs honey br o k taste my wife hates the smell my brother does not care much for them either br br all in all i highly recommend these products in the order listed and this company br br january ,o k taste my wife the smell , not as good as i be

good light taste not too strong of a flavoring and very little if any aftertaste they go down easy mmmmm definitely happy with the purchase ,yum , good but not great
i learned about these from a co worker after he made a bulk of several kinds of beef sticks a year ago he spread them around and so i got to sample a variety i have ordered the honey stung four times since then two other co workers have also ordered them on several this past year and they are too additionally we have all ordered several of the buffalo bills brands and they are all superb as long as you do not eat the whole bag i would also call these friendly as well as that is also a for me ordering these so many times other than them being just being great well seasoned snacks buy em you will love em ,the best yet found , great product
i enjoyed this product they are a good value for the amount you get i did not sense much honey in the product so a bit more flavor would be nice i would buy again ,good beef sticks , good
i though it was fresh moist however personally alittle to sweet for me i think i ll stick with the john brand brand is more expensive but it seems to soot my taste buds better ,good jerky , not as good as it
i was a little skeptical on ordering the teriyaki sticks version based on a couple of reviews but i am happy i did they were a soft stick as someone said but had a nice crunch when you bit in the teriyaki was milder than others i have ordered and they were more smokey but they are called ole i did not get the greasy mouth feel that someone said and it did have a pleasant tasting after taste all in all worth a rating but it could be a based on individual tastes ,better than i thought they would be , not as good as it is
these snacks are very different than say slim they are moist and seems less processed than many of the convenience store meat snacks out there there was a nice hint of spice laced with honey i would say they tasted and had a texture that i might have expected in a more expensive product i will buy them again and will recommend them to friends and family ,good and unique , good for you
i bought the buffalo bills teriyaki ole smokies beef sticks because i absolutely love beef sticks especially teriyaki and i thought this would be a good buy good quantity for the price br br the teriyaki beef sticks themselves were very tasty and flavorful i also loved the texture it was very soft and tender br br the only bad thing i would have to say about this product is that it leaves me with a very greasy fatty residue all over the of my mouth which kind of takes away from the flavor and my ability to fully enjoy the product aside from that i may still order it again ,beef sticks , not as good as it is
i purchased the honey stung smokies and some of the reviews stated that they were mushy i would not go that far but they are softer then most beef sticks but they still have a snap to them the taste is great even the picky kids liked these smokies i think we will try some of the other flavors plus order these again ,pretty darn good , not as good as it is
tried mild only br br amazon on br br pro br good weight price value br br con br mushy was hoping it would be drier firmer like other reviews stated br no snap to skin br so so flavor br br hot buffalo bills lbs short shots taste good have better texture br also better price weight ratio smaller means better portion control ,so so better to get hot , not as good as it is
really great snack for hiking or a baseball game my son and i enjoy taking them when we go on a road trip to hold us over till we find a good restaurant ,great flavor , great
taste great once in awhile you will come across a pocket of fat but its worth the risk anything from this supplier is good quality and value ,taste great , great taste
these have a good snap when you bite into them and a nice honey beef taste br r snacks always has excellent customer service and they throw in a few samples as well ,really good , good but not great
sustain someone for a very long time use for emergency mountain backpacking camping hiking training or any situation plenty so you could sustain yourself a long time if lost just these very light and a jar of peanut butter unopened and a large jug of water in a vehicle could sustain life for a very long time at a minimum of space and weight they appear kind of home made unlike any beef sticks i have seen in stores before my dogs like them also i break off pieces whenever they need a treat i see nothing in the ingredients that suggest dogs cannot eat them however i want each person to this on their own not just because i say so my dogs have had pieces of them now and then and love them and havent shown any signs of being sick or having less energy i recommend them ,honey beef sticks in packaging , not as good as you are
i love this product and order it quite often for my big boys to take hunting just wish the seller would take the time and money to change the label to say mild instead of spicy it isnt spicy and they have at least put a sticker on the package but have not changed the on line so i thought i was actually purchasing spicy this time still a wonderful product ,mild , great product
could only find at local shell gas station now i have a source to buy all i want fast secure delivery price is great will order again and again etc ,love these , great product
beef sticks and honey what a great combination the ole smokies beef sticks are full of flavor adding honey gives them a little twist of sweetness that just puts them over the top the honey stung ole smokies are always a favorite with our friends the pack is a perfect take along to football parties ,sweet beef , not as good as it is
i could not resist the price so many beef sticks for so cheap however i think i was expecting something different the jerky has a good taste and at first it was not very oily but as they got older and exposed to the air i did notice some oil spots forming through the of the sticks overall if you can consume this say within week of opening they are great if you need something that will stick around longer stick get it then maybe this is not the right product they also sent me a free sample of some of their other products with my order and the shipping was quick i like the company the beef sticks just were not what i was looking for i guess ,good just not what i was looking for , not as good as it is
this wine actually turned out really well i made some modifications to the kit however if you figure out the potential alcohol content this kit would probably get around but by adding additional sugar at the primary fermentation i ended up with i also did not use the whole f pack it would have been way to sweet instead i topped the off with an that i like ,this is a good wine but i made some , not as good as it is
i have now made a few of the amazon wine kits the cornucopia are all fruity flavored sweet wines within a month of the pear our bottles is down to remaining we have given as gifts and taken to get my only negative comment is that the starting specific is low therefore these are lower alcohol wines i did add a couple cups of sugar to the at the beginning but worried that adding too much sugar would throw off the flavor of the wine anyway the pear is a nice easy drinking wine it has an attractive label i used clear bottles and the final product looks sharp br if you are looking for straight wines that are not sweet fruit flavored wines check out the kits these also come with and labels they are a higher alcohol wine than the cornucopia kits with a starting closer to ,did you really make this , not as good as i like
just bottled this wine about weeks ago opened the bottle yesterday and wow i cannot believe how good it is lots of pear flavor and having experience with this brand i know that when i let it sit for a couple months it will be much better the sweetness out a little but still is great i have made about of the cornucopia wines all with good results if you like the sweeter wines you have to try this ,great wine , great product
i bought this kit and i have to say that it was a hit it was originally bought for my wife but then she decided to trade off of these for of the white that we were making for a friends wedding at the wedding it went quick and many people were asking me to make it for them my answer was here is where you buy the kit and if you want to buy it and the bottles i would be happy to make it for you i do not have a to sell it since this is just a for me br i did add one can of white grape concentrate after the f pack was added and that added so much more flavor br i promise that you cannot go wrong with this kit if you like a sweet ,excellent wine and i am going to make two more of them right away , great product
this turned out fantastic a little sweeter than i expecting but still great may even consider this a dessert wine its nice using cornucopia kits as they come complete with all the supplies you need labels etc i only use distilled water in the making of the wine dont want to chance it with anything else they have always turned out great give it a try the ,white delight , great product
this is definitely sweet but that is how i like my wine no needed it has a pear flavor and chilled well it is my favorite ,sweet delightful wine , great taste
good kit however using the f pack pear juice made it way too sweet i ordered two more and intent to blend the kits the second two with out the added pear juice ,good , great taste
i would call this a summer wine light with strong pear notes almost clear in color nice finish and a good wine for those who do not really like wine ,white , great product
i bought this kit after i really enjoyed making the tropical riesling from the same manufacturer it was equally easy to make but it is very i would not have it if it was more subtle still very drinkable but i suspect that i will be mixing it more ,not bad i like the better , not as good as it is
this is my th kit i have made and as usual it is simply amazing i am truly hooked on all amazon wine kits as they have all turned out better then i have ever imagined for the price i could not be happier with the results and will continue to purchase these kits to add to my wine i am in the process of the and am eagerly the end results ,simply amazing as , great product
hour power ingredients are pretty much the same as its hour energy so obviously the effect is pretty much the same yet this cost me for while the other cost me for at the nearest store br br great savings even if you only need these just a couple times a week br br the taste is not as tangy and addictive as hour energy berry flavor a bit bland in comparison but it is still nowhere close to bad ,great substitute for energy , not as good as it is
this stuff will give you a marked energy boost note that every person is different for me this lasted hours before the crash not a sugar crash but my heart was like it wanted to burst through my chest br br so i only drink half at a time like another reviewer and it works without the scary heart br br it even tasty ,wow for , not as good as it is
six hour power does help to create a more energetic and alert state the affect does not last anywhere near six hours for me it was a couple of hours it is not as strong as five hour power high strength but it is not as high strength either for the money i would buy this again over the regular five hour power product ,has an , not as good as it is
the hour power energy shot does just what it says a lot of times i only drink half the bottle to achieve the that i look for it is one of the best energy shots out there when you figure in price taste and effectiveness ,good things do come in small , best popcorn ever
i guess it does the job okay and it is much cheaper than hour brand but the packaging it arrived in was in spanish since i do not speak or read spanish i was a little of this item since it was impossible for me to read ingredients and nutritional information panel br the item is labelled as being made in the usa but the website on the label has a extension for being a mexican company br i do not have anything against our neighbors to the south i just expect that when i buy something on amazon that the labeling will be in english unless otherwise stated ,no , not as good as it is
my husband works outside all day long due to the recent his body is of fluids due to sweat my husband uses the energy shot along with the provides the necessary potassium to keep the body going i personally do not recommend too many energy shot drinks during the day but they do prove beneficial to help you keep going ,energy , great product
pros free super saving shipping small juicy taste flavors and healthy br br cons sometimes seller only vs to order i like to have several packs ,energy that works , great product
i took a chance with this product even though there were not enough good reviews since they are cheaper than hour energy they did not work for me so i tried red rain which did work and was even cheaper red rain did work for me so i am done with hour energy and hour power the ingredients are pretty close to hour energy but someone is lying since it does not work ,did not make the , not as good as it is
i had to be taken to the er in an earlier the day before yesterday i was having near passing out but still being somewhat conscious could not breathe and my blood pressure was at level i felt like and thought i was dying or maybe already dead for about hours it was painful and i think i figured out what it was that caused my near death experience it was probably the energy shot i took minutes before then i do not usually take something like that someone offered it to me and i was so tired i did not even look at the bottle and took it please do not use these ,product , not as good as it is
being from i can say with that this is an original olive oil its pure and full taste makes it ideal for cooking salads and dressings we were thrilled to find here in usa an original product from our country and my wife likes to use it every time she cooks resulting in tasty and full flavored foods i would strongly recommend this basic component of the diet to anyone who want to improve his nutritional habits ,excellent original olive oil , great product
this olive oil for salads dipping bread in it hummus and veggies and meat its a very high quality oil with a delicious taste try the oil by itself and compare to another olive oil and you will see the difference i have gotten my girlfriend and my mom both hooked on it in addition it has been great getting to know who helps manage the production as compared to what you buy in the store from a big brand since he goes to the farmers markets here in and lets people sample the oil br br i ve only recently found how much better local veggies and other products at the farmers market can really taste all for just a couple extra dollars a bottle of olive oil lasts a long time so paying a couple extra dollars compared to buying another cheaper brand is more than worth it ,delicious , best ever
i am a little biased in my review but i firmly believe that mt extra virgin olive oil is the best olive oil you can buy it has the best blend of flavor and low acidity that i have tastes anywhere i have tastes olive oils that say they have acidity levels but then they do not taste like anything at all i have also tastes olive oils that claim all sorts of that have made me have a fit from their here is what i think it is all about the flavor and mt simply tastes the best also since it is sources from one area i am not worried about any other oils being in my delicious extra virgin olive oil br br if you want to taste some truly delicious olive oil that does not cost a lot try mt olive oil ,simply the best olive oil from the best , best of the best
i picked up my first bottle at our local farmers market we loved it so much so flavorful but sadly there is no farmers market in the winter so glad to see it on amazon ,yum , great product
this olive oil is great tastes very good and is outstanding for use with bread pasta and for cooking in general love the flavor ,delicious , delicious
i have a pit bull who is a little over a year old to say he is food is an however with that being said he is still picky he adores these treats and others from i do much research before i feed treats food to my dog and i could not find any bad information on this company i promote these treats to family friends that have dogs and their dogs are also hooked good wholesome treats ,dog likes these a lot , my dog loves these
out of all the brands of bully sticks true chews has to be one of me and my dog favorites my favorite because they are not messy they dont break apart as easy as some of the cheaper brands and they do not smell my pup loves it because it does not make him sick does not give him gas and gives him hours days of fun their whole is great and highly recommended if you have a puppy dog with a sensitive tummy fyi my pup is currently months old and is a lb i gave it one less mark only because they are one of the more expensive brands and that they are a tad hard to find locally ,another true my loves , my dog loves these
other pretzel shaped beef were too big for toy breed but not this little one i am happy to find a usa product that is nutritional and easy to chew and digest lasts a long time give it to her for an hour a day for days she likes the pretzel better than the little not smelly or greasy also likes a href http www amazon com gp product b merrick dog treats treats a which last a long time too i try to switch up the shape of the chew b c i think it helps her teeth ,perfect size for , my dog loves them
i received these in bad condition most of them were broken but the ones that were not had holes in them they were so weak that they would tear when you tried to roll them i would try three ladies brand they are a way higher quality ,not good quality , not as good as it is
i was a little worried about the other reviews that said their wrappers were broken i wonder if they were the wrappers they suggested both suggested the same wrappers hmmm however the wrappers arrived intact in fact we took two packages camping and the left overs made it home without damage i detected no difference from the rice wrappers we buy locally at an asian market buying in bulk saved lots of there were a couple of wrappers out of dozens that had a few tiny air bubble holes in them it did not affect the taste or function that is the reason for stars instead of we were not wrapping anything that was really so it was not a problem we will definitely order again shipping was rapid a great buying experience ,great terrific price , great product
i purchase spring rolls skin frequently to prepare a tasty batch of fresh spring rolls but recently i got a container with black spots mixed into the skin i tried to rinse them off when they were but it did not work and had to be thrown away at the bottom of the container skins had what looked to be tiny within the skin at that point i decided not to have fresh spring rolls at all until i purchased a fresh batch of a different brand when trying to find the company on the internet to write them directly i was unable locate their company although there were many to the co name ,what happened , great taste
i bought this brand and it was just horrible amazon needs to source and offer ladies brand wrappers as they are just superior to anything out on the market today ,amazon please brand rice , great product
these are beautiful smooth spring roll wrappers and on the package label there is a sticker on each one that reads new so i am figuring by the bad reviews that this company changed the way they manufacture their spring roll wrappers and have probably their quality control as well i was nervous about ordering these by the bad reviews but i am glad i took a chance because these are a bargain compared to some of the other brands br br will definitely order these again ,great quality , great taste
the wrappers are good but it would have been easier if the filling was already in them the fact that it was not meant i had to look br up what goes into a wrapper and buy water shoots and bean sprouts to help me make up my own filling the br wrappers are good but more work than heating up a frozen ,food , good but not great
i am not the best cook but i like to try new things to make my diet healthier i confess that i love ramen noodles and this product helps me cut the salt content the flavor packet that comes in ramen noodles usually has between grams of sodium per serving servings in the packet i eat the whole thing so that is a lot of salt this miso contains grams sodium per tablespoon i add a table spoon to my ramen then just a light sprinkle of original flavor packet cutting the salt almost in half while still adding a nice savory flavor i also add a handful of frozen peas but i like to keep it simple i am sure there are many other recipes and uses to be found out there so enjoy ,try it with , not as good as i be
we are regular customers for the delicious coffee and purchase the french roast also it makes a single fresh cup at a time in our coffee maker ,love coffee , great coffee
in my area one cannot find cinnamon i am so happy i was able to find this flavor i just love this product ,good , great product
this is really good green tea without bitterness or the orange which is a sign of old green tea stay away from the big brands like lipton and bigelow they do well with black tea but not green br br for green tea go with this uncle lee or tazo you will never be able to go back to the others which will taste like from a river br br this is real green tea and it is not expensive recommended br br sincerely br br ,yes it is good , great tea
brand green tea is the best green tea i have ever tasted it never tastes stale unlike brands i have bought in grocery stores this is because each tea bag is packed in a sealed envelope with a metallic lining the metal apparently keeps out moisture ,the best green tea , great tea
they are awesome to snack on they have a little kick to them but that is the best part they help me with my cravings for sweets ,love em , good for you
ginger is the real deal it is natural and basically just ginger with sugar piece takes care of my candy cravings and aids my digestion of lunch etc ,totally ginger , great taste

if you are on the paleo diet you will adore these cookies br otherwise stay away your taste buds are not to the sweet natural cookies end of story paleo purchase sad standard american diet skip it ,amazing , not as good as it is
i really wanted to like these br br first off these cookies are about the size of a half dollar and are not that thick and they are more like fudge that cookies look at the ingredients they are nut flour held together with honey they need some egg or something they are gooey and sticky they are extremely sweet and pack a g carbs each and yes that is not counting the fiber br br i m sorry i appreciate the effort guys but in my option these are a they are too expensive and too non to be a serious part of your regular diet ,the must have been , good but not great
i was not impressed with these cookies when i tried them when they first came out and the company had only one flavor i did not care for them but i knew that something more satisfying could be had because i would tried others br br i have found many great paleo cookie recipes on web sites and in paleo that i love and they my friends cooking students and neighbors have really enjoyed if you are looking for rock your taste buds paleo cookies i suggest you check out the recipes for chocolate chip cookies and other flavors of cookies made from almond flour found in the gluten free almond flour cookbook make it paleo and on web site ,these cookies need work you can make your own at home , delicious
the cookies came sealed and seem to be high quality in there ingredients the only thing is they just do not taste that good my girlfriend and i thought these might be a good dessert like option while doing the paleo diet but after trying one of each kind over a couple days we just do not find ourselves going back for more i would much rather not have a dessert and really check that box on a cheat day than being left wanting more after eating these if you have a true gluten allergy maybe this is a good option for you but i am not a believer ,okay in a not great , not as good as it is
these taste very good but are not like the best things ever either in order of my preference gross to good with explanation the rainforest flavor one is my least favorites i do not recommend this particular flavor has a weird cayenne pepper aftertaste to it don t get me wrong i love cayenne but not in a cookie the tropical one tastes as if corn bread was turned into a cookie version not a bad taste really good actually the original is very great i forgot the taste though but i remember liking it alpine in my opinion is the best it tastes like a european type of christmas cookie it has a chocolaty taste to it but not overly sweet ,they are good except for the flavor , not as good as i be
i love these cookies i am on the paleo diet right now and these cookies are what i look forward too i do like the taste of the tropical one the best they all have different taste but if you want something that is grain free and gluten free then this is the right place i expected the taste to be different and it is other reviewers seem to expect them to taste like oreos or chips ahoy of course not br br when i eat them i do not even feel bad about it because my body them they do not make me crash either and feel like i ate junk food it is a good indicator that these were made from all natural ingredients i wish i had these cookies close to me i would buy them every single day ,great healthy snack , great taste
i thought i would try the multi pack to see which flavor i liked the best but i like them all they are healthy and all good ingredients i can actually pronounce these are the smaller packs and now i can proceed to ordering the larger bags love these cookies ,man cookies are crazy good , good for you
i just started the paleo diet and i love it lost lbs in like a week anyway i was so glad to find out there are paleo cookies out there and thank they are good i loved the original and when they sent me them i got a sample of tropical and i loved that too so i ordered the tropical and got a sample of rainforest at first they are good but if you read the ingredients u ll see there is cayenne pepper in it and im really sensitive to hot spices and i could sooo feel it on my it was like an after taste but if u enjoy a little fire with sweet u ll like rainforest flavor really wanna try the alpine flavored ones they are a lot darker in color so it should be interesting good job bakery i love you ,perfect for sweet just off gluten , not as good as i be
i have been paleo for six months as has my partner we both found these inedible all four kinds which by the way taste nearly the same br br i m not sure what it is about them either it seems like they would be good from the ingredients but something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good i kept trying them again hoping that they would grow on me they sure didn t we finally tossed them br br so i would advise getting just one from a local co op or something before you buy a whole bunch online i sure which i had ,taste just awful , not as good as it is
i bought a sampler pack from the bakery website it is not exactly like a cookie consistency however the texture and of the cookie i like they kind of remind me of like those natural nut and fruit bars like kind or something of the ones i have tried alpine and tropical are my favorites mainly because alpine has hazelnut and tropical has a coconut taste in it the least favorite that i have tried is either the rainforest it has a strong taste of ginger and i am not a fan of ginger the other ones are pretty good too however i did not realize that these cookies were so small but i guess based on the big portions of today society this is a normal portion br br overall its good would i buy again maybe if i was on a strict gluten free diet ,like the texture , a good product but not as good as you are
formula itself is great works wonders for a baby that spits up but why is it so expensive here for oz cans that is for a oz can when you can buy a oz can at any store for less than almost double the price i do not get it ,too expensive to buy here , great product
with all of the choices of things to drink this is an excellent one it tastes great most of our choices are either loaded with sugar or carbonated even milk is sugar dense this drink is good for blood pressure and cholesterol it is an excellent thirst quencher so much better for the hot summer months than sugary lemonade it does however the ph i am supposed to be my diet so i cannot drink a lot of this br br from the time i was a small child my mother was an of apple cider vinegar and honey for health would have been happy to discover organic apple cider vinegar all natural drink grape acai try it and drink to good health ,happy to have found this product , not as good as it is
this may not be the best tasting thing i have ever drank but man do i feel instant results after drinking some i would best describe the effects as very close to the good feeling you experience when you drink coffee i notice that my feels fantastic like my whole body is warm a very healthy dose of energy and i dont notice any like coffee or energy drinks give you the only reason i didnt rate it start is because a oz bottle is which i think is a little steep but for the great feeling i get when i drink some i would highly recommend it to anyone else who wants to feel a boost of energy as well as a general sense of well being ,awesome , best ever
let me this by saying i purchased it at a local health food store for about a dollar less i was pleasantly surprised with this drink it tastes great but definitely a little tangy what i loved about this was how great i felt after drinking it i felt awake and and just overall really good i will definitely be buying more ,great product , great product
i love using generous amounts of vinegar on sandwiches salads etc but this drink was so vinegary that i got a bit of a tummy ache it tasted closer to salad dressing than it did a drink i tried really hard to like it but no go ,the flavor is to salad dressing , great product
i bought this drink locally and i have to tell you they got it just right if you are like me and you like the flavor of vinegar this drink will not disappoint if you also like the flavor of grape the mixture was done perfectly no taste it is sort of mellow yet has that flavor of vinegar you are looking for i am highly impressed with it i went back today and bought more bottle of it at the local co op is a highly apple cider vinegar so to have that kind of base to start with means alot i can pretty much promise you that you will not be disappointed if you buy it they have a couple other flavors which i will eventually try but this one has me hooked ,awesome drink , not as good as it is
this is the best ever just add hot water and mix yummy with anything can even add to cream sauces and soups add some sausage and you are in heaven yummy yum cannot go wrong ordering this product ,best gravy ever , best ever
a href http www amazon com gp product b pioneer brand gravy mix country ounce packets pack of a br br i had this gravy at the breakfast buffet in the in mo br very good the told me the name so i looked it up on the internet and found it at amazon i give it the excellent rating ,brand gravy mix , great product
we use these for our daughter for a few reasons one they are healthier than other cereal bars on the market whole grain two they have yogurt incorporated into the bar three the are thick and do not easily crumble since our daughter starting eating them when she was about not having to clean up after she is eaten them is a big plus br br plus they are super yummy for adults too br br they are more expensive than others on the market esp since i can get bars in bulk at a discount but they are worth it makes our life easier and they do not have a ton of added sugars ,best cereal bars on the , great product
these are really excellent breakfast bars note to the previous reviewer the bars last i checked had artificial color in them these don t they also taste very good this is our third order through amazon great price and my daughter misses them when we are out ,yummy , great taste
the flavor of the fruit enclosed is outstanding and if there is a drawback it is that the that the fruit is a bit thick unlike this fig bars and pastry textured flavored with cane syrup not fruit juice cal per bar and low in fat and the carbs not too bad considering the great taste ,a healthy surprise , not as good as it is
i keep a box of these in my desk at work they make a wonderful snack or are great if i did not have time for breakfast ,wonderful , great snack
my boys have been eating these for over years now recently the box has been i like it and it is much easier to open now it used to have sharp edges and made it easy to get paper cuts it seems the recipe has changed for the bar it is softer than what it used to be the boys still like it they eat only this all day long if i let them ,my love these , great product
i bought these bars for several years at my local co grocery store and ate them daily they are tasty however the price increased nearly during that time and i noticed that although the individual wrappers within the box remained the same size the bar within the wrapper decreased when i stopped buying these the actual bar was only half the size of the wrapper that is deceptive packaging so i refuse to buy these any more i suspect that other likewise complained because last month the store where i bought these stopped carrying them ,cost as size , good for you
whole family likes these tasty but not over sweet much more healthy for you than most bars through amazon on the order subscription ,tasty and not too sweet , the best
yogurt bars are okay i found the whole grain bar very dry and there really is not much blueberry or for that matter apple flavors on the positive side the bar is a soft chew total carbs g it is an okay bar in the of cereal bars to choose from at the grocery store ,they are okay , not as good as it is
my son has been eating these for the last two years and loves them i love them because they have yogurt in them and for a picky eater provides some good nutrition wish they were organic but we cannot have them all much healthier than ,great and nutritious , great snack
are not chunky the dough is not flaky more like they are not filled with pieces of fruit and if you did not read the label which claims about items down the ingredient list that yogurt powder is added you would not have any idea you were eating yogurt at all the bars probably contain with all of the natural flavorings etc whatever calcium and other vitamins might be present have probably been added in what the ingredients list calls a vitamin blend there is too little food in the bar to give you much nutrition anyway the experience is very much like eating a long thin fig bar only not as tasty the fig bars i buy at my neighborhood grocery contain sugar but also real fruit whole wheat no and no trans fats i would rather eat one of them i will not be purchasing this product again ,eat a bar instead , not bad but not as good as it is
these are not as good as other bars of this type my kids will not eat them nor will my husband they are all fond of the variety but i thought these would be a healthier alternative ,not , not as good as
looked like a good deal so i ordered the ground fennel as well as other spices and seasonings from this company but was disappointed with them all zero flavor not even the fragrance of the right herbs or spices when sealed containers were opened the dill smelled like dried grass and the onion even worse ended up throwing them all away save your money do not buy this product ,waste of money do not buy , not as good as it is
i could not find this product in the store i love the size and the price was just right love the of the delivery ,ground , great product
as an avid rice cracker fan i have tried a lot of different varieties and this is the best as far as taste and availability goes obviously some of the best are in the japanese grocery stores but at least in my case they are out of the way most of the time br br the crackers themselves are savory and crunchy exactly what i look for in this snack and this particular mix is nothing but crackers br thanks to these i have stopped trying out the regular grocery store ,hard to find better , great for
our loves all sizes shapes and flavors of bone treats the other reviewer commented on the vendor we have never got a bad yet highly recommended ,are the best , great product
when i received this product it was old and dried out makes a good product i buy them all the time and my dog loves them but this supplier should pay more attention to what they ship ,out , my dog loves them
most of the nuts in these bags were so old they had turned black totally worthless will never order again ,do not buy these , not as good as
i did not even receive the correct product what i received were raw peanuts but had no option to return them amazon does not allow this i attempted to contact but got no reply do not buy from here ,terrible , not as good as it is
a href http www amazon com gp product b eo royal oak gourmet virginia raw in shell peanuts pound bags pack of a br br i ll appreciate your speedy deliver of my package however you sent me raw peanuts without the shell this item is going into a gift basket for my because he love raw peanuts in a shell i do not have time to returned them for the requested product you have always been prompt with my orders in the past and i really do appreciate this is the first time you sent me an incorrect product i will make it work ,order , not as good as the
i would agree with the other poor ratings for royal oak very poor customer service from royal oak we ordered this year the exact same product as last year when it arrived the nuts were not the same product and they would not refund or pay shipping for the return also they only operate the few weeks that peanuts are in season otherwise emails and phone calls are not even ,very poor service , not as good as it is
i this product my and love it pouches as very especially for breaks br to choose enjoy ,a very good product , great product
first of all there are two kinds of paprika sweet and hot both are delicious but the sweet paprika is more versatile than the hot kind which is also awesome i have been using this spice for years and the type is consistently better than any other type brand use this on meat veggies salad baked egg dishes shrimp pretty much anything i use this in soup all winter long especially with this is a traditional soup though it is often confused with and br br this product is the large restaurant size which is the only size to have if you do any amount of cooking because once you try this you will love it is versatility ,sweet good with everything , not as good as it is
i was so pleased with this purchase a great value since i got them on a monthly sale i love to have these on hand for they come into play so nicely in so many recipes always a joy to have a good crunch in some recipes one of my favorite ways to use this larger can is to wrap a piece of bacon around them and secure with a toothpick then i dip them in a apricot ginger marinade and put in the oven until the bacon is crisp my family loves an dinner once in a while and this is one of their favorites be mindful that this is a larger can so have a couple of recipes in mind for them when opening although they do stay fresh in the frig for a while ,excellent product , great product
not only is the sweetener great in coffee or ice tea it makes a skinny also try their simple syrup love it ,makes a great , best coffee ever
i adore using this very vanilla bean paste especially for my cream pies and ice cream why it is like adding a touch of heaven but without any of the bother of out vanilla bean pods the flavor is also better to my liking too than vanilla beans the price is way way better too and it is stores on the shelf for ages br br for combined shipping be sure to get their sweet dough flavoring and powdered vanilla too you will be glad you did br br for more cooking tips google my name ,a touch of heaven but without any of the , not as good as it is
the container br br another concern parents have is the cost of formula name brand formulas are expensive but if you think about it you are feeding a human being for about a week a can usually lasts us to weeks a week is peanuts compared to what a hungry devours and with name brand formulas you are getting the absolute best product available bill could not buy a better formula than what is on the shelves at target or wal mart br br if you are a new parent and feel by the infant formula section of your grocery store as i was in september i suggest starting with the formula of either mead johnson enfamil premium lipil similac advance or nestle good start gentle plus or good start protect plus they are all excellent infant formulas you just have to see what works for you and your baby ,my family formula , great product
i wish i found the plastic refill packs instead of giant metal cans seems like a lot of wasted packaging i just did not know to look for them until much later but its much cheaper from amazon than the store probably about the same price as costco but no tax here and super convenient and the formula mixes well my kid loves it and most importantly his poops seem normal not nasty formula poops if you know what i mean ,good but lots of cans , not as good as it is
alot of moms like me like this item because our babies have no on it i love it very much ,great product , great product
no gas for baby no extra bubbles when you shake it in warm or cold water mixes perfectly without much time this is easy my kid was happy from breast milk to this with no hesitation when my milk dried up at ,cheaper than anywhere else , great popcorn
we had to move to formula when our baby was weeks we have found enfamil premium to mix easier than the regular enfamil lipil our baby has had no digestive issues from the formula i love getting it in bulk from amazon as it saves the weekly trip to the store for formula the price with free shipping is comparable with local grocery stores in the area ,our choice of formula , great product
our baby loves it and amazon is very reliable and fast free super saver shipping is always a good deal thanks amazon ,our baby loves this milk , great product
i read other reviews before buying and they are not but still for some reasons i got to buy to use my amazon gift card but then i am very happy with the purchase delivery is prompt quantity is correct over all a few bucks savings than you buy at a retail shop ,very happy , not as good as it is
go to costco and you can buy lower than this price per oz currently off regular tax for big size oz br br besides it is more to return if you kid does not like this formula br br be careful many times some sellers over price a product and still make the product in the best sellers ,over priced , not as good as it is
be careful when this because they say it is a pk but you will only get a pk plus the formula goes out in months so if you did like i did and got it early for grandchildren your out of luck so i know i will not be buying off of this site again for food for my grandchildren because they will not be able to eat it ,premium can , not as good as it is
if one reads this products ingredients they will find that the first ingredient is cows milk then sugar diabetic maker then milk again the fourth ingredient is sunflower oil fifth ingredient is maltodextrin which is starch produced from grain containing the sugars and with the ingredient being get this tuna fish oil they even feature vitamin d which is animal derived there are four different sugar sources in it and some artificial flavor for good measure if we really think about what we are feeding our babies would we use this product i know i wouldn t know your food sources ,read and read well , great product
have tried a few different peanut brittle from amazon and this is by far the best it is loaded with peanuts plus being in a sealed tin makes it seem fresher minimal breakage ,peanut , best ever
i like that these are organic and do not have corn syrup my kids and i both like them i would give them stars but i noticed earlier this year that they changed the recipe the crackers are lighter and than they used to be and they break more easily and if you have kids under you might understand how broken crackers can be the taste is still great but i the old texture myself and definitely for my kids who cry when the crackers break while they are eating them and when you order these in the mail like i did last time do not expect many full graham cracker sheets most are already broken in two and quite a few are broken at the edges as well ,good crackers for my kids , good for you
i have been buying new morning graham crackers since february of never had a problem with damage of the crackers in shipping br why did amazon remove the graham crackers from subscribe and save why did amazon remove the graham crackers from prime the crackers are a much higher price from a third party seller i will purchase the crackers from whole foods not fair of amazon to take away the of ordering a case ,the best crackers but no longer available , great product
my husband has to limit the amount of sugar he takes in and these contain no sugar and they taste great ,great taste , good but not great
i rarely want to eat much when i first arise in the morning but i do have coffee i have found that these cinnamon graham crackers work great for me as a little something to eat along with my coffee they are graham crackers not anything super amazing but they are nice graham crackers that are organic ,nice with morning coffee , great coffee
my children will only eat healthy products and they love these graham crackers i am so glad that they are available through amazon ,excellent product , great snack
these crackers are terrific and they are priced right however i ordered them on and the expiration date on the box was we have only eaten four boxes they still taste fine after the expiration date but am i really expected to consume boxes in months ,too , good for you
these are very good they were a great price and fast free shipping when you purchase enough food the only thing is that the box was smaller than i guessed it would be ,amazingly good , great
i was quite surprised to find that were available thru amazon i cannot find them in the local supermarkets and thought i would have to give them up br they arrived quickly in great condition and we now are on regular shipments of them ,hard to find in stores , great taste
wow i heard of this candy but could never find it now i am hooked now i do not have to suck on child lemons with salt just ,yum , great product
i absolutely love these seven of these sweet very thin graham crisps are only calories but it is easy to eat a lot of them and there are almost in the package delicious by themselves wonderful with ice cream if they are purchased using amazon add on program there is no shipping charge br br update i have seen mixed reviews of this company products the items i have purchased have not been stale or strange smelling ,delicious , delicious
i love the degree cracked wheat and other varieties so i thought i would try the caramel cinnamon and graham as an alternative to cookies or regular graham crackers true you can have a lot of these crackers for little calories carbs but the flavor is bland in terms of satisfaction they do not quite cut it for me as a snack unless i put peanut butter or something on them they would probably be good as part of a fruit and cheese dessert along with some peanut butter fruit spread honey or cream cheese ,almost but not quite , great taste
that they have a funky chemical taste that just description the aftertaste is sort of like a chewing on a plastic cap that went thru the wash wet cardboard kinda taste seriously it was awful br br i tasted these about minutes ago and after drinking an entire bottle of water and brushing my teeth i can still taste it br br i m glad these were an add on but they are still absolutely terrible their only redeeming quality is that they are cute not one single member of my family will actually eat them though so this was definitely a waste of had i known they would be this awful i would have just got a second bag of a href http www amazon com gp product b hi i am skinny sticks sweet onion ounce a br only cent more than these but miles better in taste ,about the only good thing , not as good as i like
this soup is good i really love this brand of soups my favorite being the chicken and dumplings healthy choice is not always the best brand when it comes to frozen meals but for some reason they really knocked it out of the park with their soups i love them they taste homemade and amazingly better than campbell or progresso i recommend this the chicken and dumplings the split pea and ham in fact every variety i have tried has been delicious you cannot really go wrong with this ,another good soup from , great product
first i agree with j houston tx review br br this is not only the best flavor of the healthy choice soup line it is clearly among the best canned soup flavors of all time br br healthy choice is the only brand of canned soup i buy on any regular basis it is the only brand that has never used msg a sure sign that a recipe lacks imagination not too mention sodium issues br br i really wish i could buy quantities of this in the microwave packaging hard to find in stores a lifetime supply would do nicely ,an outstanding soup , not as good as it is
if you love vegetable soup you should like this yes it has come chicken and large noodle type items in it too br but it was not as good as i expected or hoped it would be ,taste good but not as good as i had , not as good as it is
i enjoyed this soup it was flavorful with a nice blend of spices i will buy it again ,healthy choice chicken tortilla soup , not as good as
freshly fried tortilla strips or in a canned soup i did expect something that all other tortilla soups i have tried that is a light broth with a mix of vegetables corn beans chicken and mexican spices this soup is thick really thick like the tomato soup you have ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich it is also sweet and does not taste in the least like a mexican soup instead imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables beans and some chicken thrown in br br i ended up giving it all away and to be fair one of the people i gave the soup to said her husband really liked it br br for a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup try a href http www amazon com gp product b i campbell select mexican chicken tortilla ounce cans pack of a ,thick sweet base not , this is the best
world guess you could make that of boxed versus bottled i will always take bottle over boxed even if the box is more bang for your buck i am a foodie i love food and beverage br br a lot of people are it is over priced compared to what and if you notice it is not amazon selling it it is a distributor using amazon as a to advertise and sell it the free shipping is really put into the cost of the price of a case they could reduce the price but then it would probably say for shipping it really would not make a difference br br but i am happy it is at my local health food store i am not ready to buy this by the case thanks taste nirvana this really is happiness in a bottle go get your own i am not sharing ,makes me happy i do not want to , great product
rather than paper or plastic so the taste is not compromised these things alone are worth stars to me but there are a couple things i would suggest to make it even better first this is not really pulp the way you would think of it from you experience with fruit juices where there is very small drinkable pieces floating in the liquid these are chunks of diced coconut that you have to chew up while drinking to me this would be fine if they were all the soft you would expect from a young but many of the pieces are harder which is unpleasant in a drink second ounces does not go a long way i would like to see it up to at least a oz i would then feel like i am getting an adequate amount for my money and it would last longer and quench better ,love this stuff , not as good as i be
if you like coconut water then you will love taste nirvana it has bits of coconut in it not just a few it has a lot of little bits ,delicious , water
this is great coconut water and there is no added sugar its all natural and they use ripe coconut not young coconut ,you will love it , great product
pretty close to the taste of a freshly opened coconut i would like to know more about the process for obtaining this water to understand what the natural coconut water means the tasty juicy bits of pulp in the product add an extra complexity and make this a very refreshing beverage the fresh coconut is jelly like and not so but it is still tasty ,natural coconut , not as good as it is
used to at some restaurants br br the only reason i took a star off is due to the price these oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy taste nirvana in fact at the current price this costs as much as i paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles for the best bargain on this brand buy a href http www amazon com gp product b g taste nirvana real coconut water with pulp ounce pack of a br br i wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say taste nirvana or amy and brian taste the best and i would have to give my vote to taste nirvana hopefully some day i will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote but if you are like me and do not have any coconut trees nearby try this out enjoy ,best tasting coconut water i have tasted a little pricey in these , good product but
this is my favorite coconut water having in asia and being able to get someone to a tree to harvest a coconut and then open it with a nothing i found in the store came close until i found taste nirvana the other brands are mostly from brazilian coconuts whereas this brand uses thailand coconuts and it makes a difference truly happiness in a bottle it is a little pricey but i cannot get enough ,favorite coconut water , great product
i had coconut trees growing in my backyard in asia and enjoyed drinking coconut water right from the coconut itself taste nirvana real coconut water with pulp is the closest to the real thing that i have found ,best tasting so far , best water ever
imho there is simply not a better beverage on earth since i need to add some more words see prior ,world best drink , great product
coconut water should not be sweetened actually no sugar should ever be added things is an american custom which ruins the real flavor of coconut water i lived in jamaica for years and the for and the coconut water from real coconut does not have any added sugar its natural br i will stick to buying the brown hard shell coconuts from the supermarket and drink that it is more natural and these boxed and packaged coconut water are nasty i am still yet to try a brand one of the many that i have tried that will make me wanna buy it ,not even close to coconut water , not as good as it is
this will ruin supermarket mustard for you high quality and just the right amount of bite so it allows the food to shine through ,great mustard , great product
i have tasted one too many different which claim to be spicy but fall short this spreads easy and is neither too thick nor too thin it actually does have enough heat to taste without being excessive this mustard would make a great addition to any sauces marinades salad dressings or just for dipping i would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a mustard with some true heat ,spicy mustard , not as good as it is
a very tasty little cake the cake was surprisingly moist and the caramel rum sauce was very sweet but not too overpowering we will definitely be buying this product again ,very tasty , great taste
the cake was a little smaller than i thought but it was delicious my husband and i enjoyed it so much we are ordering more for christmas ,awesome cake , not as good as
this tea actually tastes the way a rose smells it is like sipping on roses when you drink it i am glad it can be purchased on amazon because i looked in every regular food store as well as the more unusual stores like trader joes that carry unusual food items and could not find it ,sweet tea , great tea
it says habenero peppers on the ingredients but my guess is they just it over the closed bottle smells like molasses and soy sauce taste like molasses and soy sauce absolutely boring ,no heat , not as good as it is
great sauce used in many jamaican restaurants to help with the heat of the jerk seasoning most use jerk seasoning to make the jerk and pour this on later on the jerk or the rice ,tasty , best hot sauce ever
tastes too sweet which jerk seasoning is not walker woods is the most authentic to taste this was a waste ,not authentic , great taste
i thought i would try this but i am sticking with my uncle joes jerk sauce this is sweet not hot should be hot if they are going to put jerk on the label ,dont waste your money , not as good as it is
received order within business days the product received did not have the same label as pictured though the was the same also the product did not have the same flavor as the product pictured which we had bought previously locally i suppose the manufacturer has not only changed the label for this product but also the recipe the distributor provided excellent service and we have decided to keep the sauce we received just have to make our own modifications for our grilled vegetable recipe we have used in the past thanks for another great distributor for the products we like a href http www amazon com gp product b eo world style jerk sauce ounce bottle pack of a ,great service , great stuff
i love this sauce it is sweet and molasses y with a tiny kick of heat i use it to make hawaiian chicken or pork all the time i have never had authentic jamaican jerk so i cannot vouch for there but my whole family loves this one d ,maybe not authentic but it is yummy , best ever
i love this sauce i used to get it at my local grocery store but they have stopped selling it i just ordered a six pack and it is going to last a good long while most people i know that have tried this do not like it but i find the taste sweet and kind of zippy at the same time i have been trying to find a substitute for months i am so glad i found this on amazon ,yum , great taste
we used to buy this sauce at our local grocery store which closed in september luckily we were able to find it at amazon you do have to buy a pack but the expiration date is march habanero peppers give it a kick even though it has no onions i am allergic to onions so this is a welcome product very hard to find any good sauce with no onions ,sauce with a no , great product
this sauce has just the right combination of sweet spicy and mild heat that is perfect for using with a family the spicy is not overpowered with the way some other brands are baste this on grilled pineapple for jerk turkey burgers and you will be in love too my only trouble is finding it in our small town stores have had to go to the internet but it is worth it ,love this sauce , best hot sauce ever
first of all somebody is me around and all my review so dont pay any br attention to those no they both arrived within minutes of this review br br this sickly molasses flavored thing is not jerk sauce doesnt even remotely br resemble a bad i dont know what world is thinking cause this stuff br is horrible br br btw i like their teriyaki sauce but this its as bad as it gets ,no , not as good as it is
it is not great plain but it is wonderful mixed with other herbs it can be a little bland if you do not put anything but the rosehips in the hibiscus goes great with it though it is a great tea for children because it is mild and fruity for adults add it to something else br also you can eat the rosehips after they have been brewed sounds weird but they are great they taste a little bit like an apple and have lots of vitamin c watch out for the pith that the best word i can think of for the little that the seeds though if you decide to eat the hips every once in a while you find one that has not been de properly hence you need to avoid the pith if you eat the brewed hips ,a good mix in with other teas , good for you
these cloves are very finely ground and extremely pungent i use them in cooking i let a small amount soak in coconut oil and use it for oil and also mix it straight into for it works well on all counts i am very satisfied and will be reordering when needed ,delicious , good for you
this mix is probably not something you would want to use everyday its just new enough and different enough to be something special to add to your summertime recipe when you want to reward yourself with something fun and fruity this can fill the bill quickly and easily it has no aftertaste so often associated with diet drinks i highly recommend it ,a summer treat fat free guilt free , great product
when i opened the package i expect the same old tasting beef jerky but my taste buds surprised me this beef jerky tastes amazing i have been buying products from amazon com for years was really to leave any feedback but as soon as i tasted this beef jerky i wanted everyone to know i just ordered more br br ali ,beef is amazing , not as good as it is
this is the best halal beef jerky i have ever tasted also the company truly gives an muslim a good choice in buying because when you call them to ask about their process they quickly give you the answer unlike other muslim company who try do the consumer ,best and company , best ever
i am not muslim but was interested in this jerky because of its low carb content compared to some other brands of sweet jerky out there it has a slightly sweet taste and great flavor spicy but not hot it is easy to chew and does not leave your fingers sticky i wish it came in more economical sizes or oz sizes but that does not seem to be the case it is a great jerky and might just be addictive which probably makes the ounces bag size a good choice after the first ounces you have to stop at least long enough to open another bag ,wonderful beef jerky an to , not as good as it is
well after trying a lot of brands this is probably the best beef jerky i ever tasted ,the best beef jerky ever , best ever
great product and it tastes great i keep a bag in my drawer at work in case i get hungry and its great to eat to keep my protein count high since i am working out ,yummy , great product
these are very tasty but way too sweet sugary i felt like i was eating candy instead of meat if that is okay with you then you will probably love these but i was looking for something a bit healthier yes i know it says sweet in the product name but i bought it because of the no hormone no no artificial ingredient aspect ,tasty but too sweet , not as good as it is
never had jerky before because i have never seen a halal version was a little at first but found it highly addictive went through a whole bag in one sitting i recommend all my curious muslim brothers and sisters to try it ,good jerky , good but not great
i do not eat chips often but when i do these are some of my favorites they have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special the lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been on some chips seem to have barely any flavor and i find myself looking for those with the most still none of them have quite enough for my tastes i wish that these chips had more that just a hint of lime ,tasty , great chips

this oil is wonderful i have had almond oil that was so strong it what i was using it for salad cooking i loved the flavor of this oil and will be buying more ,yum yum , delicious
i wanted to love this because i love earl grey tea i need decaf and i adore the convenience of the keurig unfortunately i do not love these the flavor is very weak and does not deliver on the aroma i typically use the large cup setting on the size model but even the small cup is wimpy with these i did find that mixing this one with a stronger flavored decaf tea results in a more suitable strength but then you have to make cups of something the english breakfast decaf is a much better choice ,earl grey decaf tea , delicious
as someone who goes through lots of thyme i use it in everything except cereal i was pleasantly surprised to see this product on amazon at a very reasonable price looks smells and tastes just like any other thyme but you can not beat not running to the grocery store and paying about x more for a tiny bottle which would last maybe weeks in my house ,fragrant and delicious , great product
good product and reasonable price compared with local store for people who use it everyday it is a great deal i would recommend it to everyone who loves thyme flavor ,clean and delicious , great product
i have purchased several herbs from frontier which have been of good quality thyme leaf is always one of the most difficult to purchase due to the likely chance of more stem than leaf this thyme leaf purchase was of average to good quality i did have about stem to leaf cut in the package so i was with the selection when i dry my own thyme leaf i usually do about the same or a little less stem to leaf ratio for cooking use stem of the thyme leaf are just as favorable as the leaf and can be used to cook with successfully ,leaf , not as good as it is
i use a lot of various spices in my cooking and wanted to find a source with a quality product at a reasonable price frontier met that ,quality , great product

i brought some of this back from a trip to jamaica and wished i had bought it by the gallon it is very hard to find but well worth ordering in bulk it is a sweet but spicy sauce that takes me back to jamaica with every taste i have attempted to duplicate it many times but cannot seem to get it right i am ecstatic to finally have found a source ,so good it could be a beverage , not as good as it is
i bought this on a whim and wow do i consider myself lucky it was a shot in the dark but this turned out to be one of the best hot sauces i have ever tasted not only has some good spicy heat but excellent flavor as well it is an unexpected mix of heat with a hint of sweet and a very robust mix of spices one thing i really love about it is that it flavors whatever you put it on but does not overwhelm it the heat is hot for sure but does not linger for very long the flavor is very original i went back to amazon and bought a whole case of it ,i could drink this stuff , not as good as it is
i love jerk cooking and this is the perfect jerk sauce to put over a freshly cooked piece of jerk chicken pork goat or beef each bottle does not last long at our house ,awesome stuff , best ever
pamela makes an awesome delicious easy to use baking mix the lb bag is clearly a wholesale product coming in a brown paper bag without any fancy labels in january amazon was selling this product for which was clearly an appropriate price for a wholesale item especially if you compared it to the other sizes of the same baking mix now they are charging for the exact same product which makes it more expensive than buying the same product offered as of the lb bags in the very pretty retail packaging something is not right with this product offer anymore shame on you amazon you are supposed to be above such br still swear by pamela baking pancake mix it is the best ,baking pancake mix , great for gluten free
pamela all purpose mix is exactly what the gluten free out there need it is like using regular white flour in almost everything every time i make a cookie muffin pancake baked good white sauce etc it always turns out amazing i have been using this product for at least years i only went gluten free about years ago but i used pamela products before going gf because i liked the taste of them ,yummy , great product
i love baking mix the lb bag is quite large and the expiration is march only months after my purchase i will never be able to use that much baking mix in such a short amount of time not worth it ,baking mix , great for gluten free
years helping them to adjust to the diet and pamela flour is one of the first things i steer them to it is a great all around gluten free flour it is not too light like rice flour and not too heavy like a bean flour it does substitute well in all of my recipes it is baking outcome is very i have never had trouble with it in fact many times the comments i get on my baked goods from my non gf friends is that they cannot tell it is gluten free br br now to be fair i need to mention that it does have dairy and nuts in it this is a problem for dairy and nut allergy persons and children this is the only drawback i see in this product unfortunately i have not found something that i like as well to substitute for it ,gluten free best flour , gluten free bisquick
i am so excited about this product i have made apple cake half of the glaze pancakes thanksgiving dressing muffins and cornbread using this gf baking mix in place of the plain flour salt and baking powder they were excellent my non gf family enjoyed them tremendously the finished products were not or grainy the taste was great br br if you have never tried this test it out in the much smaller size it is wonderful ,love it , great product
i have a cafe in oregon i couldnt find this product wholesale anywhere this is so and free shipping and it was here in just a few days my supplier could only get small amounts of inferior product and it would take weeks thanks amazon ,gluten free in , great product

my wife has celiac which is a allergy to gluten in certain grains she was diagnosed with this disease about years ago when she was first diagnosed we could only purchase gluten free products from health food stores and it was very expensive as about this disease has spread more companies are offering gluten free products in our search we stumbled across pamela my wife fell instantly in love with it the pancakes made from this flour are from wheat flour we made the jump and now the whole family is eating pamela to purchase it at the store is rather expensive did a web search and found it reasonably priced at amazon we will continue to purchase pamela in bulk until it is no longer offered great pancakes ,gf flour , gluten free bisquick
growing up with wheat i had an to gluten free gf products but when my daughter sensitivities to gluten we thought we would give this a try both my wife and i were amazed at the waffles i typically made waffles from scratch but using this mix also saves a lot of time just add eggs water oil the subscribe and save pound bag is the best value with free shipping we will store unused product sealed in the freezer ,surprisingly good for to gf products , not as good as it is
i keep pamela baking mix in a gallon container with a on bucket seal lid in the pantry br br when i want to make pancakes or waffles to start the day right i take a cup or two of mix add a teaspoon of vanilla extract an egg and olive oil and i am ready to go what i enjoy most about purchasing the lb bag is that it is easy to store and keeps fresh for months yet is accessible and consistent in performance br br for a special treat i like to add hemp seed on the top of the waffles during cooking and fresh blueberries and strawberries before topping off with agave syrup ,a great way to start the day , great for
with baking instructions but this time it didn t good thing i had cut off my label and put it in the bucket with the pancake mix but other than that this mix could not be more perfect br since being diagnosed celiac and trying to balance gluten free gluten eating in the same kitchen with people we opted to move everyone gluten free at home this mix is a godsend and seriously it tastes remarkable it is a real time saver and what we do instead of drive thru windows these days i make a bunch and keep them in the freezer so they can be pulled out toasted and made into a quick pb j for the kids i am so grateful to be able to purchase this is bulk as it makes gf eating much easier for our above average family size and keeps my kitchen gf ,better than gluten , gluten free bisquick
we use this flour for pancakes muffins biscuits and more i have found that this mix works great in all my old regular bisquick recipes we find the flavor to be similar to wheat flour we have this flour into several wheat flour cookie recipes leaving out the leavening called for and only one has turned out but not inedible definitely convenient and more affordable to our family of seven to be able to purchase in bulk ,pancakes cookies and more , great for a great price
we go through pamela like crazy fantastic for pancakes we like to add a little vanilla to batter it also makes great chocolate chip cookies and banana bread the lb bag is definately the best way to go value wise ,best value , great for
my family and i are relatively new to gluten free and we have been in search of a baking mix to replace our weekend breakfasts we have tried several others and they all taste gluten free if you know what i mean pamela however is so good and you cannot tell its gluten free try it you will not regret it ,the best gluten free baking mix , gluten free bisquick
this is exactly what i wanted it is much cheaper to buy it this way and not through a store thank you so much i am new to the gluten free diet and this is perfect ,flour , great for
the product arrived just as it was described on the website no delays and arrived quickly the customer was satisfied with the quality and arrival of order ,just as described , not as good as it is
when you have health issues taking gluten out of your diet is a good way to start it may be the source of your problem it has been in my case and using pamela products has helped me get on the right track to feeling better ,gluten free and feel good , great product
what is not to like about pamela baking mix i use it as a base for a number of baked goods i have made biscotti and a wonderful lemon cake with pamela to name just a couple of things br br i got a little carried away with the last purchase i bought the pound bag which means i will not have to order it again for a year br br for those that area curious about the pamela baking mix it is a wonderful tasty base mix the waffles and pancakes it makes are delightful i really cannot say another bad about the baking mix nor amazon for bringing the larger bag option to us the consumer ,what is not to like , great for gluten free
i have tried tons of gf pancake mixes i could choke on most of them or just decide not to ever eat pancakes again these are so moist and delicious my year old grandmother was just diagnosed with celiac disease she loves them too my wife and children who are not gf also love them br m ,tastes awesome easy to make , best ever
it is hard to find quality gf products and pamela does not i always recommend this i go through a lot of this blend with a family of five amazon helps keep it more affordable the pancakes are great and the waffles are really good i have not tried it with much else yet but my sister in law does chocolate scones frequently with great i use the bread mix also all the time and am very pleased with both ,great for pancakes and waffles and a whole lot more , great for the price
meal eating oatmeal cookies on the other hand is something i can swallow all of erin baker cookies appear to be made with oatmeal and the three that i have tried are palatable enough nevertheless the fruit nut flavor was the one flavor of the three that i most looked forward to each morning i hope it was not because of lower oatmeal content than the other three br br in short you do not have to be the cookie monster to like these nor do you despite the fruit nut flavor have to be a little fruity to quote audible thoughts in or a health nut to find these tasty and nutritious maybe even dr would seem to think so and the advantage of the mini size is that you might feel better less guilty at least about knocking off two instead of just one cookie at a time ,best of , good but not as good as i like
i like them as a snack with a cup of coffee they are also great for those mornings you really are not in the mood for breakfast but know you will be hungry later they seem to keep you satisfied for an hour or two they do taste great not too sweet and not overly cake like buy a bunch and keep them in the freezer until you need more ,great morning snack , great taste
if you want a quick pick me up in a small package each one individually wrapped this is my choice i have one in the car mid compartment and in my they would be great and a pre workout snack great flavor moist not too sweet beware if you are allergic to nuts these are out i took them out of the box and into zip lock bags and when i needed more i just pulled one bag from the freezer and it worked out great ,on , great for
breakfast cookies are a favorite with the young children ages and of a friend these one ounce cookies are the right size for young children the are individually wrapped and can be used at home or as a take along snack item they can also be used as special treats on occasions like halloween ,good snack for , great snack
erin baker products are a favorite for my family the breakfast cookie mini are great for snacks coffee breaks and especially good for traveling br this is a product than a regular cookie nice and chewy and filling with only calories ,breakfast cookies , great snack
my kids yrs and yrs love these cookies much to my surprise the mini ones are just right for them and i am happy to give them cookies for breakfast there are things i do not like the individual cookie packages are very hard to open i always need scissors and the cookies fall apart easily i would not recommend passing these out in the car br overall a great product and i purchased these in bulk so we are sure to always have them on hand ,super yummy , great snack
use the cookies we take them from the freezer to the microwave for a quick warm up however still i am each time i rip into a small package that i will find mold either on the top or sides of the cookie br br this is obviously not to enjoyment while eating them br br we have never had this problem with any of the the big cookie variety br br update today i opened my door to find a box sent to me from erin baker and it had boxes of fresh double chocolate chunk minis the exact amount that i had found to be moldy in my original order amazing company check out the comments attached to my review to see how this all came about top marks to this company not only fabulous breakfast cookies but amazing customer service which they i did not ask for ,hit or miss yet everything , great for a great price
these are not awful if eaten with a cup of tea coffee or milk but they are very dry if eaten plain i do like how they have less sugar than most granola bars and are not a choking hazard for toddlers like hard snacks can sometimes be i am a fan of the oatmeal raisin mini cookies and of the regular size eb cookies but this flavor tastes very fruity to me and not very chocolaty i think the double choc cherry tastes better than these happy to have them for last resort snack on the go needs but not my favorite ,dry and too fruity , not as good as i like
i was expecting hard tasteless healthy cookies it is soft a little chewy and yummy very tasty ,tastes surprisingly good , the best
these are excellent they taste great and are just the right size two can make an on the go breakfast that is tasty and good for you the larger size breakfast cookies are just too big of these are perfect my husband had gotten out of the habit of eating breakfast too much trouble but since i bought these he is good about grabbing one or two on the way out the door ,excellent taste and handy , good for you
i love these cookies and i love erin as a result these cookies make me smile the texture makes my eyes the smell reminds me of beautiful spring days and how awesome it would be to spend them with erin have her bring the fresh cookies out of the oven and us enjoying them together on our outdoor to the and enjoying the creek that passed through our backyard br br the only thing is that this kind and the other kind raisin do not differ much in taste they both taste the same taste of heaven ,i you , great snack
i live in the area where these cookies are made and i remember buying them from local coffee stands when they first started making them years ago each one was wrapped in wrap and had a label on them the packaging has changed and there are many different flavors available now but the original breakfast cookie still tastes just as good today as those first ones did br br the smaller size is great for a snack as the large ones are enough for two people full of good stuff not too sweet it a treat that you can feel good about ,same great cookie in a smaller size , great taste
erin baker organic breakfast cookies are delicious and moist i am enjoying them each cookie is individually packaged there great for throwing in your lunch work school or driving on a trip although she makes different kinds i find the fruit nut is a favorite so if you like a oatmeal cookie that is wholesome moist then this is the one it is a winner ,organic cookies , great snack
of the erin baker products the fruit nut mini breakfast cookie is my favorite i have one mini breakfast cookie about calories with a cup of coffee in the morning and i feel satisfied and ready to start the day very healthy low in and super delicious is what makes the product work for me try it you will like it ,healthy breakfast lover , great taste
if you are looking for a rich chocolate cookie look somewhere else but if you are looking for a fairly good tasting calorie breakfast or snack these are pretty good ,dont think real chocolate , not as good as
my kids love these and we have ordered them often but as was the case with at least one other reviewer this batch came in with some mold i freeze them as soon as they arrive so had the have been moldy upon arrival br br too bad but at this price will not run the risk of having to toss out product ,poor quality control , great taste
i have been having these cookies for about years and l love it but i can not find them in the store where i used to buy i live in san diego so i would like to buy them here ,very good , great cookies
i started out thinking they were ok a little more substance than the breakfast bar from whole foods but after i ordered a pack i did not realize it was boxes of and had eaten them for a couple of weeks as i was out the door i realized they were not really very tasty and kind of dry ,still looking for breakfast , not as good as it is
if you want to treat your tastebuds to the ultimate delight try dulce de leche and this brand is the best as a of argentina i grew up with this stuff and no imitation comes close serve it inside slightly warm folded and with powder sugar with or ice cream and remember a little goes a long way very sweet ,heaven on earth , great product
a friend brought me this from argentina and my kids and i ate it with a spoon and then apples so that i would feel less guilty when we finished i immediately because i was not sure if i could get it here in the u s low and behold i found it on amazon it is different packaging but same company so i assume it is just to americans delicious ,heavenly , not as good as it is
i think this is the best dulce de leche i ever tried i discovered at the hotel in argentina on a recent trip they serve it at breakfast there ,yummy , best ever
just an outstanding product br br an authentic dulce de leche number one in argentina for its exceptional richness and depth of flavor br br made at a small dairy outside of br br note that the web page or supplier indicates made in but this product is clearly made in argentina ,love , great product
i was born in argentina and this is a top of the line dulce de leche to eat with or as add on to cakes comparable to br br note i noticed that dulce de leche is an acquired taste so unless you grew up eating it you may consider dulce de leche to be a little too sweet ,yummy milk , great product
my father grew up in argentina and since he came to the states has been searching for the perfect dulce de leche that reminded him of his childhood he does not have to search anymore i bought him a couple of jars this past christmas and he has been a happy camper ever since ,exactly like in , great product
we used to have a to get homemade dulce de leche from a but alas said moved away this is the next best thing and does not me hanging out in the kitchen for hours while my milk ,almost as good as homemade , great product
very high quality dulce de leche from argentina compared to most brands it is a bit lighter colored and the taste is more subdued and you may or may not appreciate this as it is not the classic taste that you expect from commercial dulce de leche but it is by far the closest to the homemade dulce that my grandma used to make for this i would give it stars if i could ,excellent , not as good as it is
this is a good quality product which definitely helps my tummy i have it each evening and it makes a huge difference in how i feel definitely recommended along with acacia fiber which is life changing ,great tummy , great product
i was not much of a tea drinker until i bought a breville automatic tea maker and a bag of tummy tea fennel for my wife she started brewing the first pot of this new tea and did it ever smell great a little like licorice we both shared that pot and have been hooked ever since this is one of those teas that makes you just feel warm and all over it is a feeling you do not forget if i was on a desert island and could only have one tea this would be it br br for those who enjoy drinking tea i would encourage you to look into the breville tea maker produced by a german firm it is without a doubt an tool for brewing tea the price for this is a little high but believe me it is worth every penny ,a tea for the , great tea
i love tea hot or cold and am always looking to try new ones this tea brews up a wonderful cup just opening the bag to scoop some out is a joy the smell alone is i tried a cup to relieve a stomach ache and it relieved my discomfort immediately it really does taste just like good quality licorice and it is naturally sweet when my urge for sweets hits i can now reach for this tea instead and it really does satisfy my cravings this tea will be a staple in my pantry ,so yummy , delicious tea
i think this is a really good deal i seal it up in a container and just scoop it out to brew good stuff ,tasty good price and organic , good
and those strong mints you can get tired of the taste of mint especially in the morning i gave up coffee months ago and i still some mornings so i am looking for some kind of substitute forget decaf anything forget chocolate forget tea some people swear by hot water with lemon i don t too acid this fennel tea sells elsewhere as tummy tea it does it is better than chamomile tea which does not do much for me in terms of flavor or calming anything br br i ve used this fennel tea in those mornings when nothing else will settle in when even mint leaves or herbal teabags of mint leaves are too much this goes down nicely but if you are not a fan of vegetable soup or celery this might take a little getting used to me i like it the smell reminds me of ,as soup without the , not bad but not great
the fennel smells fresh tastes good and makes a great addition to one of my tea blends it is packaged exactly as shown in the picture came in a timely manner thanks ,good tea service , great tea
i think that is due to the lack of corn syrup i do not really notice any difference note that these do still contain gelatin so should not eat this i think that their jelly beans and the gummy worms are safe for the natural fruit juice flavors are delicious and the fact that you get your vitamin c as well is just an added bonus i would definitely recommend these though i suggest you get these small bags over the large ones as otherwise you might find yourself eating the whole thing in one go br br one last caveat if you are on a budget i suggest you go with the sweets sour gummy bears also available on amazon as they are ten dollars cheaper i am still of the reason for the price difference but if you are on a budget the other ones are great too ,the perfect corn syrup free replacement candy , a great product
these are guaranteed to be a hit with my kids br like regular gummy bears but even better with extra flavor br perfect consistency not too chewy great all the way around ,pricey but flavorful , good
my four kids love these it is great that there is zero nasty stuff in it like grocery store fruit ie total chemical junk snacks a safe kid snack ,yummy , great product
these are always delicious a much healthier alternative to most candies kid sugary snacks the size is perfect for goodie bags even fits in large easter eggs ,yummy healthier alternative to most snacks , delicious
i found these little delicious fruit snacks at a gluten free show in the guy that was there offered me a package and i fell in love they are organic which makes them all the more cool and they are very very tasty i looked on the ingredients and was surprised to find no high fructose corn syrup they re a little chewy at first but i can not find anything else wrong with them they are a wonderful fruit snack that i do not feel guilty about eating afterwards ,delish , delicious
my month old grandson only eats organic foods and i was looking for a treat to give him when he visits he loves these candies and i do not feel too guilty because they are in a tiny packet with only a few in each one they stay at grandma and grandpa house of course we brush his teeth afterwards ,loves them , my favorite
you cant go wrong with especial this is one of the best in argentina go for it seller did everything ok in time and etc ,best , great product
up with hot water for a couple hours as i sip it through the br br the main thing that pleased me about this merchant is that the product was considerably less than what i had been getting from my previous the difference is probably about handling and storage the bags are like a bag of sugar and a lot of rough handling could crush the leaves inside creating dust in the mate dust gets through the holes in the and coats your tongue tastes a little bitter and generally the experience br br when it first arrived i opened a bag and poured it into a big container that i use to store it and i immediately noticed that there was very little dust compared to what i had been getting when i ordered this from my old seller br br i m very happy with what i received ,good product , it is
especial can never let you down tastes fresh and strong i smell argentina in every sip yerba mate is going through an increase in prices almost double crazy but it is worth the value i will never change especial ,always good , good
if you are setting out a whole can at once or some of it to a container for later use flip the can over and use a can opener to remove the bottom of the can you can then pop the top of the can releasing the vacuum holding the food in place and the whole thing will slide out much easier and than out the can with a spoon ,on the pop top can lids , not as good as it is
i have been feeding wellness grain free for a couple years now with great results for my cats i believe the cost of a top quality food is well worth it in healthy happy cats and reduced vet bills but still the cost of wellness has been i was excited to see felidae had a grain free formula in the larger sized cans and for a much lower price so i am trying it just switched them over this week so far so good the bowls have been licked clean and while i the whole peas when i saw them they were not left in the bowl the ingredients and quality of the felidae seems comparable to the wellness so unless i find information otherwise and i have been looking i think we will stick with felidae ,high quality for less cost , my cat loves it
a case of felidae along with a case of a href http www amazon com gp product b b w pet fish chicken liver food for cats a well they love the petguard but absolutely hate the felidae all three of them sniffed licked it and looked at me like you are kidding right even mixing in some of their old food and gradually trying to change them over would not work they would sniff it and walk off br br they love the petguard though and will it the second i put it on their so at least i discovered one good food they will eat i guess i will donate the cans of felidae i have left to the local shelter despite the fact my cats would not eat it i still gave it stars because it is a great quality food if your cats will eat it ,great quality food my cats hate it though , great food for cats
i have house cats one was recently diagnosed with diabetes we got his diabetes under control with insulin but i began researching diet information to help us all of my research led us to try felidae grain free i spent two weeks carefully switching louis and the four girls from dry iams to felidae i was immediately able to decrease his insulin and by the time i had him totally on felidae we were able to insulin totally all with our veterinarian a consistent feeding schedule and measured amounts it has not been but it has been louis has been insulin free for two weeks now all five cats ages to love the food their stools are good their coats look wonderful they have not vomited for weeks yay ,happy cats , cat cat food
cat from iam canned food to this one thinking that i would have to mix them together at first to get her to eat it however she ate it immediately i was so happy as another reviewer said there are whole peas in this stuff it looks a little gross but my cat eats it however i must admit that she will eat just about anything her favorite treats are oat grass spinach and broccoli she is a good eater br br before i switched to felidae grain free my cat was vomiting frequently i think it was due to food allergies either to grain or food coloring maybe since switching she has only thrown up one time you can only imagine how happy i am to not have to clean up vomit every other day br br also since switching my cat fur is much more smooth and soft ,real food for cats , cat cats
i changed our of to healthy wet food br every cat with a urinary tract is fine until they start to strain to and have to be rushed to the er br with all the issues of recalls and such concerning the pet food industry we rotate different brands of food felidae is one it has no grains soy corn or icky fillers felidae is a pate loaf like consistency br since changing to a wet food only diet none of our cats have been back to er in years none throw up no runny eyes coats are shiny no hair all are at a perfect weight the changes are amazing br having cats i am very thankful for the oz size cans of felidae br i had a question recently and sent felidae an email they answered very promptly and were very kind their customer service deserves stars also ,stars and thumbs up , cat food
i would been feeding them wellness until the recent recall after checking some reviews i looked around for something healthy in the large size cans and decided to give this a shot they are always enthusiastic at but they have been literally over each other at for this one caveat unlike the wellness it has a pull tab which is good news bad news no need to mess with a can opener but it is absolutely impossible to get it out without a spoon or a huge mess ,my cats go wild for this stuff , not as good as it is
our former vet and fed her science diet k d she dropped down to less than pounds in a month we switched her back to newman own turkey and within one case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of lbs and has maintained that healthy weight for over months she also gained increased after we stopped feeding her the k d i read somewhere that science diet buys students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products nice br br just say no to science diet and felidae grain free formula here is the good stuff a href http www amazon com gp product b newman own organics turkey vegetable formula for cats ounce cans pack of a br br did they really want me to post a video with this review would you then its this review will remain video free ,cat after eating this runny , cat food
great price and my cat loves this food he has been on it for years my vet says he is the cat he sees ,my cat loves this food , cat cat food
free for a while now and all three of them love it i ordered the felidae last time because the wellness was no longer for free shipping and the felidae was which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at petco brick and mortar none of my cats will eat it they actually at nothing for the past days since the only thing offered them was the felidae i broke down today and gave them a back up can of lives grain free and they are happily up and now i think felidae is a high quality food and i only feed the lower quality grain free food on rare occasion but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter hopefully something there will like it i am off for the trip to petco for the wellness ,cats will not eat it , my cat loves them
not usually picky and i have had them on natural balance venison grain free canned and dry food but one still has digestive problems probably from ten years of eating junk kitty food so i keep trying to find a food that will help to him i tried felidae and he and one other cat eats it but the other two don t i do believe one is extremely picky because he will not eat halo brand either but loves the natural balance and taste of the wild grain free options i hate having to buy so many different brands to please my four cats also this says protein derived from fish so maybe they are having a for the fish it is too bad because they do love tuna but it causes the sick one to vomit every time oh well it is a another miss in our family ,two cats will eat it two t , cat cats love it
my youngest cat goes insane over this stuff which is good she is the reason we had to seek out a new food that was for both adults and kittens my older cat took a few weeks to adapt to the creamier texture compared to her favorite canned food although she loved the taste right away once she got used to it we started going through this case like it was going out of style and i had to buy more i have noticed much less smelly litter boxes since we got into this case compared to many of the foods we use that was a big bonus for me and enough to convince me to put this into our regular rotation of canned foods ,happy cats and happy me , cat cat food
the digestive system of some of mine do not tolerate much grain or gluten so that is very much a plus the price on amazon is better for a large can amount per ounce than i can find at local pet shops or stores so when you can get the free shipping it is really awesome to have pet foods at your door service too i hope amazon will just continue to make pet food supplies to your home affordable and at a top price sometimes though when i go to try to re order cannot find the same deals available so i just and watch and wait sometimes til it is offered again to make it affordable not sure why that happens but i know i have to watch it to make sure i do not end up with a high shipping fee in my cart prior to purchase ,excellent product for your cats , great product
cats do occasionally need a little green in their diet not a whole lot but their typical prey in the would probably have in their stomachs when killed and eaten that being said my kitties are weird and love to eat vegetables i have a toddler that likes to throw his food around so some ends up on the floor and they are there to when it falls the ingredients in this food are wholesome my kitties eat this food whole peas and all and it makes their coats wonderfully soft and silky this is not the only wet food i feed them but it is one i do plan on keeping in their wet food rotation i give it my solid recommendation ,this does have whole in it but it is a good food , cat cat food
we recently adopted a new kitten we rotate felidae grain free canned formula with wellness turkey canned food he loves both and eats well he is never left a single whole pea behind this is a very high quality cat food using excellent all meat proteins he is healthy active and has a smooth glossy coat definitely worth the cost in the long run br br i believe it is to rotate different high quality canned foods for variety and to not create a cat who will only eat one brand i think this is useful also in the event of a recall i am looking for a rd high quality brand to add to the rotation ,excellent grain free option , great product
bought some can lids at petsmart and they seal air tight on these cans so fridge storage is clean and easy br br he has the absolute fur coat i have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy we have not had a single vet visit since i adopted him even though he had chronic upper issues when i got him they all cleared up i have to blame at least some of all this on the fact he only eats grain free felidae food the rest is because i love him so ridiculously much br br i love the free shipping on amazon i buy a case of canned and a bag of dry or two of one at the same time i used to buy this elsewhere and since it is so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product ,super soft and healthy cat , great product
the consistency of the grain free chicken turkey lamb and fish formula was like br baby poop there was so much water in this cat food that two cats went through a br full case in a short time i can put the water in the cat food it is misleading br and a poor value for the manufacturer to water down a product call it a oz can br and provide nothing like i have come to know and expect from other brands the same br size ,poor value for the money , my cat loves them
i was really hoping this grain free canned cat food will work for my cats looks like it has good ingredients but none of my cats will eat it in fact one of them will smell it and start doing the scratching thing like he smells poop another weird thing is the whole can is kind of soft and like baby food but there are some whole green peas in it not sure if that is by design or some green peas escape the ,my cats will not eat it , cat grass
first off my cats loved the food one of them has had issues in the past and i need to be careful with what i feed him and this seems to work well however about half the cans were your normal cat food consistency and the other half were incredibly runny and nasty looking they ate both kinds with equal gusto so i do not think anything was wrong with it per se but i still found it a little concerning i am ordering another batch and we will see how that turns out ,mixed , cat grass
i gave it stars because of the quality ingredients but if neither of my cats will eat it what is the use we tried weaning them to this food from the junk we have been feeding them by mixing and slowly the amount of felidae or by getting them real hungry first all to no avail the only way they will eat it is if we cover it with from fish we cook for ourselves or from cans of sardines br br more than anything i think the mushy pate type texture them more that the taste because it smells pretty good to me ,i and my dog love it my cats hate it , my cat loves it
wonderful ingredients list but the peas are whole if i do not mush them several of my cats just eat around them br the cats i all prefer the regular felidae formula and it is a little cheaper too ,great ingredients but , great product
this yuban dark roast is outstanding it is smooth with a chocolaty taste i find it as good as any far more expensive coffees i would also recommend purchasing the ounce because the coffee is when you can pop open a new can and use it up without or freezing it br br i do not like many dark roasted coffees because i do not like the burnt taste yuban dark roast has no burnt or bitter taste definitely the regular roast for this one br br also keep in mind that this review is written by someone who thinks starbucks is far far bitter burnt ,as good as gourmet , not as good as i be
if you like strong coffee this is it the flavor is exceptional i have not found better in a can this can be expensive and difficult to find at your local store i have had great luck with amazon good price for the subscription order you can get a case a couple times a year and still get the reduced rate amazon also has a wonderful return policy br try yuban if you love strong coffee and have not found the coffee for you this may be it we have been drinking it for years now have had the original organic and dark roast i dont have a preference they are all excellent ,great for strong coffee lovers simply the best coffee , great coffee
my husband and i are always searching for better coffee and seemingly there seems to be something wrong with them all lol i have finally decided that yuban is without fail my favorite coffee it has no aftertaste is not bitter in any way and it remains constant can after can on that note my husband can go grabbing different can after and grinding himself silly if he complaining about each one i m settled on yuban ,around in my , great coffee
excellent we have enjoyed yuban coffee for many years we recently tried the dark roast coffee and would recommend it if you want a rich tasting coffee smooth with no bitterness beats the high price of many gourmet coffees without sacrificing that delicious flavor that coffee lovers look for ,great coffee great price , great coffee
yuban makes the best cup of coffee either roast is never bitter and makes a great cup of coffee we like our coffee extra strong and we have been using yuban for years the coffee is very consistent and distinctive br br this is the best canned ground coffee out there period we have found none to match the true dark smooth cup of coffee there is no bitterness or burnt taste just silky rich coffee add a dab of half n half and you have bliss in a cup br br don t spend your money on the expensive coffees this is the best br br if you are about coffee buy yuban ,and never bitter even when made extra strong , great coffee
living in my wife and i drank the popular regional coffee community coffee we now guess out of when we became full time in february we packed lbs of that coffee but ran out in so we tried other dark roast including maxwell house gourmet dark roast and then the yuban dark roast omg what a difference br br we ll never buy anything except yuban dark road smooth and silky without that burnt or bitter taste br br difficult to find in south but easier then there is always amazon with delivery within days br br ya gotta try it ,best dark roast coffee you will ever drink , best coffee ever
yikes what was i thinking when i ordered cans of this stuff the food pantry may be getting some br br it tastes like well i cannot use the words i would like to br let just say that it has no character at all no distinct taste if yourself and then drank the coffee i do not know if you would even know it was coffee br br i use just more than the amount doesn t help ,not the best , not as good as i be
i can only say that this is great coffee never tried before until recently now i like it better than folgers ,yuban dark roast coffee , great coffee
i was drinking yuban organic medium roast coffee until i could not find it anymore at my local grocery store so i tried this instead what a let down after drinking the organic coffee this just tastes like average grocery store coffee comparable to folgers but the organic stuff now that is a different story that stuff is good tastes damn near as good as the fresh stuff you can buy at or caribou coffee houses do not believe me try both this and the organic version side by side you will not go back to this again i promise you that if you have any coffee sense at all ,not as good as the organic version , not as good as i be
until recently i thought that coffee was coffee but apparently it is not that simple drinking coffee can either be an good habit for the environment or a very bad one br br the good news is going green is easy look for the by environmental watch dogs like the rainforest and keep up the demand for arabica uh or rainforest blend coffee just ask for them at your local grocery store or favorite coffee house br br more voted yuban as a product of the week because the great taste helps wake you in the morning and the environment as well ,the best , great coffee
i wish they had not changed the formula for the yuban that was sold up until about years ago i even contacted general foods and asked why they had their coffee and they told me they were going back to their original formula from many years ago why they had a great product and now it is no better that any other dark roast coffee on the market yuban was a special treat now it is just ordinary i still like it for everyday coffee but it sure is not what it used to be formerly i even preferred it to starbucks but no more ,i wish they had not changed the formula , not as good as i be
we had not been able to find the dark roast yuban in any of the stores recently when i ordered this they gave me a date of receipt it actually came two days earlier my husband was so excited when he saw what i had ordered thanks for the quick service on a great product ,best coffee , good
warning it contains food preservatives other than that it is fine but presence of preservatives in dates my low star rating ,contains food , great product
i own a small night club and this is hand down the most popular snack item we have at first we were just giving it away until we started going through way too much of it to justify that anymore in addition it is not available anywhere in town and before we found it here we had to go to a sam club miles away to stock up on it apparently it is about as close to being the perfect blend for a wide variety of tastes as one could expect to find the company also makes a club mix as opposed to the pub mix i made the mistake of buying a huge supply of that and met will strong and continued from our they look about the same but apparently the club mix lacks some vital ingredient ,the most in our , great product
i had received it and i could only say a caring who included it in one of their care box of goodies br br i loved it so much that i ended up on this page because i decided to go online and search for it and see if i can get multiple packages of this shipped to my unit here in iraq i do not mind paying a few extra bucks for it to have for me and my fellow to enjoy it is just that good that it is worth it br br this is a great product and all should try it after you do you will not think that mix can light even a candle next to the utz pub mix believe me try it and you will want to keep this stocked in your cabinet for everyone in your family and their friends to enjoy ,mix is a hit even in , a little of the
i found these tubs at costco and was dismayed to discover that they are no longer carrying them i buy the pack here at amazon and i am very satisfied the snacks are tasty not too salty and offers a variety of chips in the mix that all blend nicely ,hard to find excellent snack , delicious
this is definitely the best snack mix i have ever had it got me and my buddies through many movie nights while in iraq ,almost too good , delicious
i agree with all who have said that this is a great snack but i just wanted to say that i for a pack of oz containers from the actual utz site ,great snack , good
is not something usually cared about or taken into account with utz products which tend to be very reasonably priced for the most part unfortunately like a lot of things that are really good this mix is not easily found locally i see it only at the local walmart here in the small oz size that carries a hefty price i buy it anyway on occasion for its so good but make no mistake about it its not cheap as snack chips go and unfortunately i do not recommend buying this mix on amazon in any size it is way too expensive here for any deal currently being offered if you wanna try it or like it already i suggest you search it out locally at your big department stores it never found in supermarkets round these parts spring for the price and grab an ice cold beer and enjoy ,really good but price anywhere , not as good as i be
i tasted this snack at my local pub and found it tasty much better than chips or other mixes i was told it was sold in sam club and wegman for per z container bought it from utz in a pack for br each piece has a different taste and texture could not ask for a more delicious snack or a better price thank you utz ,delicious snack , delicious
hands down the best snack you will ever consume at a unhealthy pace br br it does contain msg so do be warned but if that does not you as it would never me give this a shot this has been a godsend during road trips movie parties and general get of all kinds ,mixed snacks of the , delicious
enjoyed the product and they also provided very fast shipping i am about out and need to order more ,great product and would buy again , great product
this mix is great anytime i love it would recommend it to anyone that likes mix ,great snack , great product
i absolutely love this mix we keep it on our home bar and everyone loves it ,best bar mix available , great product
i found this mix at the i looked for this product last time i visited the and could not find it so here i am online looking and found it here i could eat this all day i have tried several different snack mixes but most have too many pretzels this has a very nice balance of flavors and textures and not a lot of pretzels i am stocking up ,mix is addicting , best ever
this is an addicting fantastic snack mix it has a wonderful variety of crackers and blend of flavors ,wonderful blend of flavors , delicious
the taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the msg those who are sensitive beware also msg addition is usually a way to fake true flavor ,contains msg , not as good as
the problem with this mix and to mind the only problem is the of one or two slightly sugary little things this provides an experience of well at least for me i have never been one to mix the sodium and the glucose and this surely is not me especially when they are in the same bite handful ugh br br otherwise this mix is really yummy it all tastes rather waxy and i am sure is not the healthiest food in the world though you could do worse but its a well combined mixture br br but then again i have got to sort of work my way through at a pace because i must grab a handful and then separate the maybe i am just or maybe they made a mistake and should be br br oh yeah like the last reviewer i too got em at costco ,now , not as good as it is
cat grass seeds will sprout very easily you can sprinkle them on top of any kind of moisture soil or moss my cats eat the sprouts very quickly i suggest that you purchase multiple seed packs i did so to insure that i would have more sprouts ready when the first was gobbled the only drawback is shipping cost which is more than the seed packets themselves that is another reason to order in the shipping cost for several packages is the same as for a single packet ,easy to grow my cats love it , cat cat cat food
this is good stuff however i planted it and no cats grew up just grass ,good stuff , good stuff
is also good for them and will help them away from eating my cat often nibbles on then throws up and i am always afraid that it will do damage to her digestive system when there is cat grass around though she only eats that she really it down and it makes her happy too cat grass is also good for cats it contains vitamins that may or may not be present in cat food and it aids their digestive system and helps to eliminate fur balls br br even if you do not have a green thumb cat grass is so easy to grow that anyone can do it and it is also a great project for kids too the seeds sprout very quickly if you keep them moist and will grow quickly to inches in a window br br if you have cats cat grass is a must ,easy to grow and good for your cat , great food for cats
the packet of these seeds that i received must have been old because i do not believe even of them grew i tried some several times in soil and water and only got a few of grass i garden regularly i live in florida so it is not that i do not know how and i even followed the instructions to the letter but they did not grow ,seeds , not as good as it is
i have had luck with this seed and all the other packets i have purchased from the company that makes it br right now the packet over a year old and i recently planted another pot and had a high rate in about two days and it was about three inches tall in four days br the cats love it they ate so much i planted yet another pot br having the grass around our cats from gnawing on strange things like plastic especially when they are having digestive problems ,easy to grow and cats love it , cat cat food
to have grass to nibble on this grass grows and is ready to in days or less br my how to br get a small shallow plastic container with a lid br punch several holes in the bottom of the container with a nail br fill the container with organic soil sprinkle about tablespoon of seeds on top pack the seeds into the soil by pressing them in firmly w br until some of kit leaks out the holes in the bottom br place on a dish put on the lid keep out of the way for the seeds to checking to water every days br once the grass has grown about inches remove the lid and place in the sun br put grass in a new heavier bowl so the cats cannot pull the entire patty of grass out or walk off with the container with they nibble it ,great value , great product
i use this to grow my cat grass every month or so now that it is spring i can find the pots at the stores again i just keep two and alternate so he always has grass growing he loves it so i bought several packs at once probably more than i will need i get several batches out of each packet none have been so far either ,great grass , great cat food
cat grass also known as wheat grass is a great plant for anyone i typically do not do any type of but i had no trouble getting these seeds to sprout and grow these seeds make a great project for cat lovers and children too br br the hardest part of caring for these plants is keeping your cats from keeping from them completely that is what happened to mine at least and my cats still several months later will check the area where i kept the cat grass for more of this tasty plant ,daily of for your cat , cat cat cat
received this product much sooner than promised seeds grow as claimed and plant is great my cat loves it highly recommend product and seller ,great product and service , great food
this stuff is awesome br br grows very fast and grows into a full grass section br br my cat loves it and with other cat i have purchased she has vomited after sometimes but this stuff she so far br br like another reviewer said shipping for one package is same price if you buy so stock up and save on shipping and the package was very nice just thrown in an envelope ,great stuff fast and full , cat grass
we have been buying cat grass for many years and this product is very well priced and works just as good as the expensive packages br br our cats have grown healthy and happy since they have this grass br br great seller delivered on time and product sold is exactly what we wanted and will purchase again ,cat grass does grow real cats , cat grass
so these seeds do exactly as advertised i bought of seeds and have so far used i always get a pot full of strong bright green grass which my cat readily devours not much else can be said good deal good grass man ,grow some grass man , great product
on other plants i decided to grow my own br my little guys love this stuff but there is one problem being dogs they can be a little messy and they tend to want to rip the grass right out of the pot roots all i have taken to trimming the grass daily and placing it next to their water bowl br trimming just seems to the grass to grow faster much like your lawn as with your lawn i find that adding nutrients iron to the grass it keeps it is beautiful color and many months of fresh new grass br do not know the exact reason my dogs like grass it might be just like humans we like a salad for a change maybe it just add something that is missing from their diets guess you might say dogs cannot live on meat alone or something like that ,cat grass no longer just for cats , great product
i planted this grass and in days i had inches of grass br br the price hurts since you are basically paying for shipping the cost of the seeds themselves are as shown on the package i could not find oat grass seeds at or my local independent garden center i am hoping to find somewhere local to buy them so i can buy more seeds in the future without having to pay a premium and wait for them to ship ,excellent , great product
the grass sprouted quickly with a great rate the cats love it so much that they tried to get to it by knocking it off the while i was out of town the pot was upside down for at least a day and it looked like the grass was all going to die however a week later it has almost fully so it is pretty hearty ,good grass , cat food
our cats love the grass it is easy to grow and it sprouts within a few days so you have an ample supply on hand an excellent product to maintain a cat health ,cat grass , cat grass
i wanted to grow some cat grass for my kitty to him from my other plants in the house i planted them in a large window box with soil i had a large bunch of grass in about a week my cat loves it and it looks great in my kitchen ,great cat grass seeds , cat grass
i normally purchase already grown containers of cat grass at my local pet store however the last few pots developed bugs in them which just was not i bought these seeds from and they grew insanely fast my cats love the taste i have already bought another pack so i can re plant once the cats finish off this batch ,my cats love the taste and i love the price , cat cat food
these seeds grow very easy one seed pack grew about little pots i would grow using a few seeds about every days in separate little pots for my cats so they never was without a great buy ,they grow easy , great product
excellent only days and about of the seeds are up to an inch if i had not done this before the instructions would have been wonderful they left nothing out i will buy these again ,cats love it too , great taste
tiger loves the cat grass it only takes about a week after the grass is planted to come up so it grows very fast i planted it in a pot outside it did very good outside ,loves the cat grass , cat grass
it was so easy to grow and my cat loved it i highly recommend this purchase your cat will love you forever ,cat grass , cat grass
unfortunately love it too so we are having to grow this batch of cat grass indoors the cats love this stuff just put it where they can reach it and they will go to town on it munching it all up it does not make them like does so do not worry about that you do not have to do anything to these seeds other than press them into some moist soil and water when the soil starts to become dry and crumbly that is it a nutritious treat for your cats ,cats love this stuff , great product
these seeds always grow unlike some other brands every single one of my cats totally loves the resulting oat grass there is nothing else that all five of them all agree on so br br thanks for such a great batch of seeds ,grass well , great product
in less than a week my kitties had grass to much on i was surprised with their reaction to it it seemed like she was given this before at her previous home she rushed right to it as soon as she saw it and it down to nothing the first time it got eaten the plants back to life and grew faster than before but after being a second time the grass kind of dried up and died which is okay because i have plenty more seeds in the pack ,very easy to grow , not as good as it is
excellent product and price would do business with this company again br my cat loves it cannot wait to plant it again ,cat grass , cat grass
the true test is that our cats really loves the grass we grow from these seeds and they grew very easily in pots too ,great seeds , great product

i just picked these up at random at my local asian market and i am really impressed i would drive the minutes there again just to pick these up they have an excellent coffee flavor and are not horribly sweet like most hard candies each candy is individually wrapped and lasts a good long time ,really nice flavor , not bad
great candy sweet and intense low calorie and delightful made with actual coffee not just flavoring fantastic reasonably priced too ,very , great taste
japanese sweet but strong black coffee candy lasts a long time in your mouth and costs alot less on amazon than elsewhere made with real caffeinated coffee for a little energy ,delicious strong black coffee candy , great coffee
there is nothing wrong with this product but it is overpriced with a little research you can buy this for less than half the price buyer beware ,overpriced , not as good as it
my cats really love this lives seafood and poultry cat food br they prefer this pate to the slices or chunks br they are a perfect weight and have beautiful shiny coats br and lots of energy br it is good quality food and is very fresh ,good cat food , cat cat food
we enjoy these peanut butter and jelly bars my year old with celiac disease says he can have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich again he loves to pack these for school snack ,yum , great for
my year old recently was diagnosed allergic to gluten these pb j bars have saved us he loves them and these are his favorite flavor ,j , great for
i tried these bars and they were very good although i do like the peanut butter chocolate chip bars better the bars are a quick and easy to carry snack when you are on the go ,p and j bars , great taste
out of all the granola bars that bakery on main makes my year old loves these the most maybe it is because she can still get the taste of a peanut butter and jelly but in a snack bar we always have to have a box of this flavor in the house ,my year old loves these , good but not great
these are good bars for being gluten free not my favorite bar out of everything they carry but still good to keep around for a hunger attack if you really want to try something great try their coconut cashew now that is incredible it is like you are being but you are not ,good for on the go , great product
you just cannot go wrong with peanut butter and jelly these were so delicious as with the apple cinnamon i had a hard time keeping my gluten free husband away from these yummy ,how can you go wrong , good but not great
one of the best peanut butter bars i have ever had the fruit jelly is so good and brings the whole thing together in a good snack or dessert ,j , great taste
of all the flavors i have tried of these bars the peanut butter and jelly is my favorite everyone loves peanut butter and jelly and it is just as delicious as a bar ,my favorite flavor , great taste
this is my favorite granola bar being vegan and gluten free is difficult when it comes to finding granola bars that meet my needs this one is absolutely delicious i love the ingredients and all the strawberries throughout the whole bar highly recommend ,my favorite , great product
my sweet daughter loves these i mean what kid does not love pb j and what mom loves not having to make it they are sweet and make you feel like you are not missing out on anything being gluten free highly recommend it ,perfect for lunch boxes , great product
wonderful my son loves these granola bars he has celiac and we wanted to try something different these were a hit ,yummy , great product
my girls love these bars they are nice for lunches or quick snacks on the go good flavor gluten free and dairy free is difficult but bakery on main does it right yummy ,yummy , great snack
peanut butter and jelly together how can you go wrong it is great and without the worries of gluten makes it even better ,how can you go wrong , great product
i love these they really taste like a soft pb j sandwich and you can bring them anywhere kids would love them too i hope they are available again soon because i am running low ,these really do taste like a j , great taste
childhood all over again i love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches but i do not often make them because they are rather messy these bars solve that problem the oats and stuff provide a perfect compliment to the peanut butter and jelly flavor that is in the bar the best part is that i can eat this on the go and not have to worry about my hands or clothes getting up ,simply perfect , delicious
it is cubes for our horses they came in on time and the horses like them there is not much more to say about sugar cubes ,sugar , great product
all my horses love a sweet reward dots hold together nicely in the reward bag ,sweet , delicious
i love this tea it is hands down my favorite and the ingredients are very clean and it is low calorie especially compared to other teas out there this is the real deal it is basically like making it at home br br it so yummy light refreshing i could drink it all day by the gallon ,best tea on earth , great tea
my husband and i love this product because it is naturally sweet without the taste of artificial sweeteners most peach flavored teas taste like sugar and artificial flavors but not this drink it is wonderfully watery to quench any thirst i only wish that amazon would always sell it because we would buy it on a regular basis ,delicious , not as good as it is
look at the ingredients it is made with black tea google black tea and fluoride and you will see that black tea is loaded with fluoride because it is made with the oldest part of the tea plant it contains the highest level of fluoride of any tea fluoride is not healthy for anyone if you want a healthy natural tea get one that is made with white tea leaves white tea leaves still have all the beneficial antioxidant properties but much much much less fluoride than either black or green teas ,just a of warning for those that love this tea , great tea
just received a case of this tea it tastes good and a bit on the sweet side but not overly sweet i would give it a higher and better rating if it is not made in china though ,good taste but made in china , not as good as it is
since of tea discontinued their cherry vanilla tea i was looking for a replacement the flavor of this tea is very different from it is better the smell is very rich like toasted vanilla and cherry it almost has a coffee smell but not quite i do not like coffee but this tea is incredible glad i found it best of all the price ,should be tasty cherry , not as good as it is
i really like this tea but my husband smelled it and commented that it smells like cough syrup the taste is more subtle than the aroma overall this tea tastes good and is a good value it is not the best tasting cherry vanilla or cherry tea i have ever tasted but i would purchase it again ,good tea with strong cherry aroma , not as good as it is
if you can get over the high price why not enjoy some of the best coffee in the world right here in the good ol usa br br warning once you get spoiled by this coffee you might not ever settle for less br br bottom line great product would recommend to a friend ,kona is the best , good coffee
i have a bag of this coffee shipped to me every other month i do notice the flavor can vary over time with that said the worse i have had was just plain great and the best roasts are to die for i have noticed this variation with other coffees too i always assumed it was the minute differences in roasting and of course the bean itself being a plant it will hardly have the exact same characteristics of another plant perhaps weather count too this last year the flavor and taste has been more consistent than it was a few years back everyone has different tastes but speaking for myself this is as close to perfect as it gets ,kona in , great coffee
i enjoyed my st cup very much the aroma was and the flavor was pleasantly mild but ultimately it is too mild for my daily morning kick i will be going back to my lavazza mornings when this is gone ,good but very mild , good but not great
tried this because it is kona and much cheaper than the other national brands i have been using what can i say i am greatly surprised mild no bite too it and no acidity this is on my shopping list from now on ,excellent stuff price , great product
spent for real kona coffee and did not want the kona blend sold here the hawaiian roasters was disappointing tasted nothing like the kona we had everyday while in maui not good ,kona coffee review , great coffee
this is by far the best kona coffee i have had i use to purchase trader joes kona coffee but for the last several months they have not had any and i have been unable to locate kona any where so i thought i would try amazon i saw this and although the price is the coffee is amazing very smooth with great taste i drink it both hot and cold a pound makes a lot of coffee and while i did not figure the price per cup i still think it is worth it and will purchase it again ,wow that expensive for coffee , best coffee ever
special gourmet coffee br br i ve tried different regional coffees including new aa sumatra beans jamaican blue mountain and others i have to say that kona is my favorite by far the shipping bag comes oxygen free when it is being shipped from the vendor the air is sucked dry to vacuum seal it sometimes they get damaged or punctured during shipping i guess that is what happened to one of the bags as you know coffee and oxygen do not go well together cause once the coffee is oxidized it starts losing its freshness and it does not taste the way it is supposed to taste br br i ve made a recent purchase again and i am very happy with the results give this coffee a try before deciding to make a bulk shipment you have got nothing to lose well done hawaii roasters you guys have ,worth it , not for me
my son was on vacation a couple of years ago and brought back hawaii roaster kona coffee they have a different the way it is grown then most coffees i thought i would check to see if it was on amazon this is the best tasting coffee i ever tasted well worth the money ,cup of you will ever have , delicious
this coffee has a smoother and milder taste than a dark roasted coffee i like to have this coffee and a dark roasted on alternate mornings the daily contrast in taste keeps me the delicious coffee favors of each type ,medium roast kona coffee , good coffee
this coffee whether brewed in the keurig via eco cup or in a standard coffee pot tasted stale not the coffee that i expected to taste it did not take me back to hawaii but instead took me to the folger coffee aisle in the grocery store will not order again what a waste of money br br updated the seller got in touch with me and offered to refund my money he for the coffee not being up to standard the seller has good maybe i just got a bad batch who knows thank you ,coffee not great but the customer service is , good coffee but not a great price
this coffee was delicious i actually purchased it as a gift but since i paid for lb of coffee i tasted the coffee br br it was so good i meant to purchase the light roast but accidentally ordered the medium it was full bodied and delicious totally lacking the high acidity that you find with most commercial coffees i cannot afford pure kona all the time and normally buy blends but this coffee is the delicious gourmet coffee you need to buy and keep for company or to treat yourself now and then ,expensive but when you taste it you will know why , good coffee but not a great price
the best thing i like about this sports drink is it is not an energy drink low calories and less caffeine then ounces of coffee br br of natural anti inflammatory ingredients which aches and pains and it is not necessary to take over the counter when you have this br br when i first had some i felt different not a amp different rushed just different scared me a bit days later i tried it again the feel different was the pain level going from the constant to a which is for me the feel difference was me feeling better br br this is giving me the year window i need before i have to get my neck and again br br at our house now we have at least cases and this month it is ,drink , not as good as it is
this jerky is quite pricey for a ounce bag but it is one of the few i have found that is salty enough and does not contain a bunch of sweeteners br br the smoke flavor is also pronounced unfortunately the price is the only thing that keeps this product from getting stars from me ,extremely pricey but one of my favorites , not as good as it is
i have reviewed this before this jerky is fabulous great salt great snap great flavor so tasty i want some now ,just gets better , great taste
these were a wonderful surprise more delicious than anticipated and guilt free i liked the smaller size pouches easy to carry with me nice to give as a gift the bonus is that they are organic i will be buying more ,a snack , great snack
further this should be in every adult easter basket or christmas stocking i have not raved about a candy like this since see dark chocolate covered raspberry br br if you like walnuts and dark chocolate you will absolutely love these the taste is so it is hard to describe i just ordered packages for me and to use as gifts amazon you need to start selling these so i can use prime shipping these will fly off the shelf i promise br br ingredients organic walnuts organic chocolate coating there is some organic chocolate and soy in there that is why it is so tasty and smooth contains small amounts of milk soy wheat and egg and is manufactured in a plant that processes peanuts made in the usa by tropical valley foods br br yes these will melt in your hand or the hot sun so be forewarned ,where have these been all my life , not bad but not great
i like my chocolate to some level of crispness these nuts were chewy not crunchy and the chocolate coating was a bit br if you know anything about dark chocolate and like yours with some snap do not order these br br actually the best dark chocolate covered walnuts are called and are available through a canadian company called br they are sun dried super crispy covered in a fairly thin shell of dark chocolate and with unsweetened cocoa br very adult and superb ,poor texture , not as good as it is
the walnuts and chocolate are very high quality they are rich and decadent it seems strange but when i am eating just a small piece it tastes like i am eating a brownie highly recommended ,treat , good but not great
the product is great but it arrived mostly melted together instead of individual drop pieces i am sure it was over heated in the shipping we live in central california where temperatures get into the s i am able to use them anyway by just cutting them up br partly my fault i will try to remember to order during the winter months for cooler weather br excellent product ,dog treats , great product
these smell so good i am tempted to try them myself i have to keep real chocolate up in my house because my two chocoholic dogs will and chew open to get to it but they are very happy with these instead i am so glad i found this safe alternative for them ,yummy , good for you
my dogs and some other dogs i like to spoil too just love these they are their special treats ,my dogs love them , my dog loves these
i must say that has put life back into my dog he is old and offers him more vitamins and minerals than what he was getting from his food now he has more energy and begs for these choco drops ,is the best , my dog loves them
have been buying this product for over a year and max would eat it as fast as i could give it to him however one or two drops at a time for a reward is his limit yogurt is his favorite ,my dog this stuff up , great product
my dog loves dog drops with so much he will do any trick possible to have one sadly they are getting harder and harder to find so i was thrilled to find them here and the price was great ,this five up , my dog loves it
my puppy is a very picky puppy after spending hundreds of dollars on finding treats that she will eat these are one of only two ,best treat ever , great product
we ordered the product our dog loves them but no one cares if its degrees outside recieved in one big melted ball thought they would ship in dry ice if its summer or hot in your area dont order them ,dont do it , dog loves it
my pug absolutely adores these treats and will do anything for one i can get anything away from her and get her to go anywhere they are a big help for me and a wonderful treat for her ,fabulous , great product
my dog loves these treats i can get him to do anything using them they were much cheaper using amazon even with the shipping charges ,dog treats , my dog loves these
i can not believe that this is actually for sale it needs to be recalled sugar is absolutely unhealthy for all your pets they do not digest sugar like we do every vet will tell you the same thing and you will never see any quality treats or food that has sugar or corn syrup on the ingredient list if you do see it on the list do not buy it ,sugar is bad for dogs first ingredient is sugar , not as good as it is
this is my nd review for this product the first one was supposed to be words that would be too long for this item the product itself is good but the price for shipping for such a small item was ridiculous the package was small and light weight but i was charged for shipping of a item i have bought many items from amazon com and it seems here lately that the shipping has gotten totally out of hand i bought several items and the shipping was all together therefore i did not know how much was charged for each item i will not buy from this vendor again since they are making money on the shipping enough said ,too much for shipping , not as good as i be
key lime pie is one of my all time favorite desserts when i heard about this gum i was definitely a i figured it would taste more like just a standard citrus y mint gum i was wrong this definitely tastes like real key lime pie filling actual key lime flavor with a milk sweet taste that is not too overpowering the flavor actually lasts for quite a while too though it is much more powerful within the first minutes try it ,tastes like the real thing , great taste
but i will give it a shot wow so far i have only tried and intend to try the key lime pie and the mint chocolate chip but they are both amazing they key lime pie is incredibly tart and delicious but unfortunately the flavor only lasts about seconds the mint chocolate chip is also incredible and the flavor seems to last much longer or at least the post flavor gum is more appealing in any event even for seconds of flavor these gums are a great idea by wrigley ,cannot how wonderful extra dessert gum is , great product
key lime pie is getting rave reviews throughout my office i bought a pack of it to share with my co workers as well as the mint chocolate chip and strawberry shortcake varieties all have been tasty but key lime pie has been the star excellent ,love the new dessert , great product
i just got a pack of the key lime pie gum and it is some of the best gum i have had it really tastes like key lime pie almost so and is flavorful but not too strong the idea of dessert flavored gum sounds a little like willy wonka but it tastes really good and i am looking forward to trying the other flavors ,good gum , not as good as it is
i am addicted to this gum it tastes so close to the real thing and does not lose flavor compared with the apple pie or strawberry this best flavor of all of this series along with the mint chocolate chip ,delicious , great taste
i like the dessert delights line and this is one of their better flavors but the carton i received contains only packs that are stale the sticks are stiff and difficult to chew and the flavor within minutes i am quite disappointed that they would dump old products on their customers ,great but stale , not as good as it is
i could not find the gum at the grocery store so i ordered it from amazon the order came quickly and the gum was great ,great gum , great taste
thankfully i was able to order quite a supply of this gum my sister and i enjoy this flavor the most and was sad to read it was discontinued i paid a price so i thank you ,key lime gum by extra , great taste
it is almost how this gum tastes so similar to actual key lime pie i just picked up my first pack today i this is definitely my new flavor extra really hit the mark here a different unique and incredibly delicious gum this scrumptious delicious treat is sure to please do not hesitate to buy a pack ,quite an experience , delicious
i when i could not find my extra key lime pie gum in the stores then i thought where can you get just about everything amazon of course and to my delight my gum was there if you love key lime pie like i do this is the next best thing to your teeth into a creamy rich key lime tart delicious piece of pie without the calories ,yummy gum , delicious
wow i like the flavors i have tried the apple pie mint ice cream and the strawberry shortcake not too fond of this one but the others are great i love the apple pie and this key lime pie br br it says hydrogenated starch not oils difference ,key lime gum , great taste
this gum is delicious and since my first pack i have been hooked i love the mint chocolate chip after meals and the key lime pie is delectable at all other times br br at pack on amazon it is not really a deal though considering this is only a a pack at target or once the price of a pack drops to about or i might consider buying it online if only out of pure but a premium is not really worth it ,delicious dessert replacement for , delicious
i loved the flavor and the fact that it was so long lasting everyone in the office eats it now we only eat half a stick so we are not sitting around with a big of gum in our but so far i have not been able to this gum for flavor if you like a bright citrus y taste that is not too overpowering you will love this if you like a more minty gum then go for the mint chocolate chip flavor of this gum ,awesome taste , great taste
i was actually very surprised that this tasted like the real deal it is very sweet very and the first couple hundred chews you can taste the crust and a of whip cream after a few minutes it still has flavor after an hour it still has flavor i love it you also get the tangy effect of a lime not as strong but very ,amazing , not as good as it is
i did not expect this gum to be more than just your typical lime flavored candy type taste but i was floored this gum literally tastes like key lime pie i swear i can even taste a graham cracker crust the flavor only lasts a short time but it is an amazing taste floored ,so amazing , not as good as it is
this is the absolute best gum flavor ever it really tastes like key lime pie and the flavor lasts a long time yummy ,best gum ever , best ever
not bad but there are better gums than this one at the beginning is a big of flavor and sugar like sensation but after minutes is gone ,so so , not as good as it
not being a hard core gum chewer i was thrilled with this gum a great taste in a gum that last plenty long without any loss of flavor or any kind of after taste a pleasure in my diet routine ,key lime gum really , not as good as it is
i have tried wrigley apple pie flavor of their dessert delights chewing gum it tastes exactly like apple pie i cannot wait to try the key lime pie flavor everyone who has posted a review here on amazon says it tastes exactly like key lime pie wrigley chewing gum co appears to have hit yet another one out of the ball park john v john ,key lime is an how did they get the flavor so right , great product
if ever there was a gum to worry about having in your stomach for seven years as the popular states this one is the most likely it tastes great sure but in the first few bites it falls apart losing any and just gets for some reason about of it remains intact and becomes gum what little remains is as the other reviewers state but knowing that i have more than half the sticks i have chewed is not a pleasant thought ,great taste , not as good as it is
i really like this gum like all of wrigley gum products i have tried this is absolutely great these dessert delight flavors are truly delightful ,key lime gum , great taste
like other reviewers i had low expectations for this gum but was happily wrong i love key lime pie and lime flavor in general when first chewed this gum has the tangy bite of key lime with a creamy sweetness and a hint of graham cracker crust flavor after the initial flavor burst there is that of artificial sugary sweetness that occurs with some brands flavors of sugarfree chewing gum but the is not as overwhelming or long lasting as it is with some sugarfree gums once that the gum has a mellow subtle lime zest flavor i really like this gum ,very tasty , not as good as it is
admit up front that i have not had a key lime pie for years so i do not remember the flavor like it was yesterday and this probably worked in my flavor i remember it in general though br br this tastes awesome i can definitely taste the lime and it tastes like what i remember a key lime pie to be the lime flavor is there but it is up by a nice creamy taste that almost made me want to grab a few extra slices of gum hey it is calories a slice so i can splurge on this while i would not want to splurge with the actual pie unfortunately it falls prey to the same problem that the equally yummy apple pie flavor had the flavor does not last nearly long enough br br i ll absolutely buy this again despite the flavor only lasting minutes ,very yummy , good product but
in this age where even basic service no longer exists i was pleasantly surprised when my transaction actually came off without a shipped on time and the product was in good condition well done ,surprised , great product
initially the flavor is fairly accurate however weak from there the flavor rapidly i just it and this gum goes flat within minutes br in light of my experience i find these rave reviews somewhat one reviewer even went as far as to describe it as incredibly tart meh br like many new products in the of gum pop energy drinks and fast food they only need you to buy one if everyone does that they will be sitting pretty br based on this experience i have no desire to try the other flavors of extra dessert delights br three stars it is ok but does not live up to the hype ,i really wanted to love this gum , not as good as it is
at amazon if they had i would not have purchased it they use partially hydrogenated oil a kind of fat may be to your health long term since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label a lot of the food industry has switched away from it as people are correctly suspicious of it br br to add insult to injury i was unhappy with the taste they have a chemical nasty taste i suppose that is subjective but a few bites left me a little br br i feel bad having bought this but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack please pass this company products by and let us find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a ethical and legal way ,a poor choice , good but not as good as i like
i love salt and vinegar potato chips but cannot eat them on my low carb diet these pork skins are a wonderful replacement for those high carb snacks the salt and vinegar flavoring in the pork skins is a bit more than what i am used to finding in most potato chip brands but is definitely adequate to soothe my cravings for a crunchy salt and vinegar snack the pork skins are light and fluffy with almost none of the hard rinds that can be found in some brands of pork skins if the flavoring was a bit more pronounced i would give this snack five stars ,great low carb replacement for salt and vinegar potato chips , great taste
if you like salt and vinegar chips but want to avoid carbs then pork rinds are for you especially this brand i will eat these instead of chips any day ,these things are really good , great chips
would have rated stars if it had more of a vinegar taste overall not bad at all good snack ,very good , not as good as
cannot find them anywhere where i live so glad i found them here not too salty or vinegary just the right amount thanks ,good item , great taste
the customer service was beyond compare i would gladly do business with this company again ,salt and vinegar , great product
i have a hard time finding this up in new england so glad to see this product here this is my favorite product in my spice cabinet i have tried many other so called cajun spice blends and find that they are too salty although this is salty too it is not predominant on the palate or too hot which a true cajun spice is not hot bon ,i miss the , delicious
this is a wonderful product i was happy to see i could buy it on amazon because our local stores quit carrying it we use it mostly to sprinkle over chicken wings to make a cajun wing yummy it can be used on almost everything love it ,wonderful product , great product
the pan becomes to dry after turning the fish during this i make a pot of spaghetti my wife likes angle hair after the pasta is done drain it and remove the fish to a turn off the heat under the skillet add a little more olive oil and butter scrape up the bits of fish left on the bottom of the skillet and dump the pasta into the skillet and mix it around to soak up the buttery oil than sprinkle some more seasoning on the pasta and serve with the fish everyone love it to give this dish a little color you can add a bag of fresh spinach to the pasta water during the last minutes of cooking or stir in a small can of diced cajun tomatoes after you put the pasta in the skillet or use both hope you enjoy it if you try it ,fantastic , excellent
fried baked potato etc not only is it a very good combination of spices it is also ground fine and mixed well whenever we fry something in batter or breading luzianne cajun seasoning usually finds its way into the mix br br we ve tried slap ya and other cajun spices but those tend to be too coarse instead of tasting a blend of spices you tend to bite down on a of salt filling your mouth with the taste of salt then a of pepper filling your mouth with the taste of pepper etc luzianne is definitely the superior br br we recently ran out of it and to our dismay safeway has stopped carrying this product which is why we have tried other brands none have measured up which is why i was searching for it online we are very happy to have found it again on amazon ,excellent wish still it , i love it
this product which i am not allowed to return has ingrediants of salt spices soy protein that last item is the common industry con for adding msg to your food every soup on your grocers shelf contains msg but i so the third ingrediant is a form of msg further down the ingrediant list is msg this does not add spice to your food it your tongue into feeling that the food tastes good when it does not msg can make dogfood taste like hamburger anyone who thinks this is making their food taste cajun may be serving alpo tones and sp do not contain msg i prefer tones br br i have eight ounce cans of this stuff would anybody like to buy some hamburger from me ,msg , not as good as it is
health it causes the product to cake and clump i steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them an even though this may not have many trans fat an over time is what makes this bad for your health when i purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description now it is i think that amazon as a regular practice should require all food products company to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site why wait until the customer purchase it to find out i do not think this is a customer friendly practice br br not a good buy imo i found my at another site and will be purchasing it from there unless amazon brings it back at a count offer otherwise to buy one at and s h is just way over priced and highway robbery ,will never buy again , not as good as i like
i grew up using this seasoning on steak and pretty much everything could no longer find it in stores so ordered a case off amazon very happy nice spice and flavor highly recommend ,love this seasoning , great product
i love this product and cannot get it locally anymore it was a fair price and the item was in stock and came quickly i would buy from them again ,is awesome , great product
this is a wonderful mix of spices one of my favorite uses is on chicken on the grill try this out br br cloves garlic minced br tbsp luzianne cajun seasoning br tbsp olive oil br tbsp lemon juice br br combine ingredients with chicken in a gallon size zip lock bag and marinate chicken legs thighs for hours br br mix up a second batch and brush over chicken while grilling cooking on all sides br br just made this yesterday excellent ,excellent mix of love it , great stuff
this is the best cajun seasoning ever we use it on seafood steaks and burgers seasoning enhances not overwhelms whatever it is put on ,great stuff , best sauce ever
i have been using luzianne cajun seasonings for years i find it best on beef and fish seafood like one of the other reviewers i like the and the blend of the seasoning the combination of the two gives it it is unique flavor br br when i have friends and family over for steaks they always say these are the best what is your secret i first tell them it is an old family secret but then i tell them about luzianne i am not sure they are because the next time over we have to go through the same conversation oh well more praise for me br br thanks luzianne for all the on the back ,the best not really , best ever
this seasoning adds just the right amount of spice to almost any dish if you want something with a little kick you will love this seasoning cannot beat the price for a top notch product ,great seasoning , great product
oh man i like many of us have tried so many cajun seasoning but this company does it right br br thank you folks at the heart heat of southern seasoning br br all my love br br ,seasoning for all it is best , great product
originally discovered this years ago on vacation in southern since then it is always been in our cupboard we came home to pa that year with three cans of it and then each summer after a couple of years it became available in our area but in the last year or so we have not been able to find it anywhere this is one seasoning i do not mind buying by the case and it is a great price too br br we put it on virtually anything and i mean anything meats poultry seafood salads spaghetti eggs pot pie vegetables soups whatever it is especially good on any pasta dish i even sprinkle it on a sandwich the spice is just the right amount of heat with the touch of lemon to top it off it sounds weird but i think i could even enjoy this on ice cream ,good on everything , great product
luzianne cajun seasoning is a great way to spice up anything you make it adds a nice amount of heat to your food without being over bearing my whole family loves it ,great seasoning , great product
i have been using this spice mix for many years but i have found it hard to find lately i decided i would check amazon and i was very surprised to see it available i am a fairly good cook and i have developed some easy dishes using this mix and it is very unusual and tasty a pack is a lot of this spice but it does keep for years and i use it quite often give your family the kick it deserves with luzianne cajun seasoning ,a taste of n great spice mix for many dishes , great product
it br br i agree with other posts that some of the flavors are very runny we just add a few tsp of cereal and problem solved br br earth best is more expensive i calculated that every weeks of food costs me more than buying the other brands however we decided that since he eats it all vs being very picky with other brands it is a wash br br if you want to use earth best for your baby w out breaking the bank try these tips br visit earth best website and print off all the coupons they will allow usually have family and friends do the same br br buy at whole foods they have good prices and when you buy a lot they give you a bulk discount br br you can also buy them by the case at for less than cheaper than here ,great variety no picky , great product
i thought i was doing my kid a favor when i invested in a case of earth best dinners unfortunately the second ingredient after water for all of these is applesauce or in the case of the sweet potato chicken variety it is sweet potatoes followed by apricot puree br br after getting used to the sweetness of these try em they are like jam it is difficult for kids to adjust to real food from now on i am going to stick with just home cooked food it is a lot cheaper too ,very sweet not , not as good as the best
in the public interest popular brands of baby foods including heinz earth best and nut according to the center report earth best did not use fillers or replace real food with water and agents in many of their products for children over six months of age such products are nutritionally inferior to products made with more fruits and vegetables earth best uses certified organic products the brand offers single ingredient smooth foods for infants over four months fruit vegetable grain and meat blends for babies over six months and a variety of chunky soups dinners and vegetable for children over nine months old earth best products are sold at supermarkets natural food stores and big box stores br br plus my baby girl loves it yes it might be a little runnier than the other baby foods but i just add a little rice with it and that fixes it ,did a lot of on this brand , best baby food ever
there to maintain the color of the food i make my own sweet potato and chicken dinner for my little one and it turns brown my baby does not care about the color of the food but i am sure maybe a mom would freak out if she saw this color in a baby food jar knowing how vibrant sweet potatoes are br br half of the jars in my case were popped up i wrote amazon and at first they offered me not even the cost of the damaged jars i called and they replaced the entire case free of charge this had to have happened at the manufacturing plant and did not occur during shipping but rather was a sealing issue i was impressed with the speed and at which amazon this will continue to be a loyal customer because of this customer service goes a long ways ,baby best packaged , great product
we love the earth best line in our house our mo old daughter will only eat earth best dinners and i do not blame her the smell from both of the other brand was i have sampled the earth best dinners myself and they are not half bad it is baby food the fruit blends and veggie blends are great as well ,earth best is the best , great product
question the value of this particular earth best item i just found the tomato and carrot one which i have ordered but not received yet also if you put in organic baby food in amazon search there are some brands with just food in them for example rabbit organics have not yet tried it but might when she is a bit older br br overall though i do recommend this variety pack our daughter likes them all and she is getting organic ingredients and for a decent price even considering the amount of water in them the water being first in all is giving me as to the overall value and definitely something i will keep in mind as to trying other brands going forward the ingredient lists are all directly from the earth best website com as i do not have the products in front of my right now ,our old loves them all but be water is the by weight on all , i love it
i agree with a previous reviewer when it comes to the dinners just about all of the earth best choices they are watery and sweet apples or some other fruit in just about everything and the first ingredient is nearly always water i have decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein containing dinners from another jarred brand or mixing my own i would really rather not a sweet tooth at such a young age br br the earth best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great just check the label to make sure water is not the first ingredient listed i just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up ,love the earth best brand but , great product
earth best rep did say that they were doing testing of bpa free alternatives for lining their baby food jars br br this is such a shame because earth best is the only company that makes organic pre packaged stage complete meals e g with meat protein veggies carbs starch in puree form all the other organic baby food manufacturers such as plum sprout kitchen etc only make stage meals in chunky form earth best does make some baby food in bpa free squeeze pouches but that does not include its dinner line i was hoping to be able to my little one to a variety of flavors and well balanced meals while still at the puree stage but i guess i will have to wait until she is old enough for stage chunky meals or make her baby food myself virtually impossible for this super busy and mom lol ,not a fan of bpa in baby food jar lids , great product
i ordered this from amazon and they were pure liquid like water i did not feel at all comfortable feeding them to my daughter amazon customer service however was awesome and gave me a full refund ,earth best way too runny , not as good as it is
bought this after reading the good reviews not sure if it has to do only with my package but rice and lentil mix literally has a smell of mold i actually opened two containers to make sure it was not just my nose playing tricks on me i love this brand and i am very disappointed ,some of the flavors of , not as good as it is
and problem solved turkey dinner is thick enough i also do not understand why people complain that they are too sweet or unhealthy first of all if you do not like the ingredients buy something else second i trust earth best enough to believe they know the right amount of stuff to put in their product third the belief that if baby tastes sweet food they will not eat regular food is an old wife are you people saying that you do not give your babies fruit and vegetables they are all sweet br the only reason i gave this particular item stars instead of five is the price i can buy it at my grocery store for cents a jar here they are being sold for over cents and that is at the sale price if you buy these at the regular price it comes to way too much ,we love these but amazon price is than , not as good as i be
i would continue to buy but i am moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars too many they like all the flavors though great textures too ,organic and tasty , not as good as it is
i love the thought that these baby foods are organic the shipping is quick well packaged and easy to open baby likes all flavors so far of any type of earth best baby food however this brand is always more watery than any other brand i have tried ,good but watery , great product
our primary reason for buying this product is that it came in a variety pack we make most of our own baby food but we were going on vacation and that was going to be difficult since packing space was limited we had this shipped to our it was the only brand we could find to order in a variety pack the kids liked all the flavors and the consistency seemed good ,earth best variety pack , great product
my month old is a fanatic for these flavors she gobbles them up and we cannot load the spoon fast enough for her we introduce new foods every days and we always get the interesting blends as well so she has tried tons of flavor by this point and these really do get a reaction from her she goes mmm mmm lol it is so cute and meats are an easier to absorb source of iron compared to artificially enriched iron that is found in baby cereals i definitely prefer this as a compliment to mommy milk as to the cereals that are hard for little tummies to digest ,my baby favorite flavors , great for
i actually cook most of my twins savory meals but i always keep a package of these eb dinners on hand for feeding the girls on the go and for those times when i just do not have the energy to cook or whatever is in the freezer the girls like most of the flavors except for the peas i wish eb had more variety packages with different flavor available ,ok but would like more variety , not as good as it is
to be honest my baby did not really love all of these at first he is pretty picky so i had to mix fruit into some of these to get him interested in a few of them he took to the gourmet meals pack right away but did not love all of these but as he is gotten older he is gotten less picky and seems to accept all of these flavors now without having to him by mixing in fruit the prices on amazon are good so i will continue to order these here ,healthy selection , great for
my one year old loves this product she eats one every day and never gives me a problem and i trust the ingredients which me that she is eating something thats good for her ,great product , great product
amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and on time but i guess this is one product that they can not br br several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out i wish i could order this by mail but it seems this is one item we will need to go to the grocery store for ,product is good amazon is poor , not as good as it is
i like the variety in this pack nice to not have to pick out individual jars and my baby likes them all the only thing i would suggest is if you have a picky eater maybe buy one jar at a time to test them out before you buy a huge box ,great variety , great product
i purchased this food on amazon then saw it at babies r us for cents less per jar i like the product but amazon is ,price , not as good as
my baby has been eating this brand since he was months i like the convenience of high quality yet not overly pricey jar food like this it is easy on his stomach never had any health issues with it the dinners are a bit more filling than the usual watery vegetable puree but it still does need a little cereal to thicken up summer vegetable is his least favorite the zucchini like cucumber smells pretty strong he would eat it now but when we first started he hated it my son loves the other flavors and that is why i continued with my subscription since it is more expensive to buy them separately ,for almost the same price as better quality for your baby , great product
organic foods of course are best for your health and starting your baby on foods that are pure is best no matter what i highly recommend earth best products he loves the formula foods and i love the products because it is best for my baby i wish i knew about organics and earth best years ago with my first baby ,my son loves earth best , great product
my baby loves these dinners they are very flavorful and not bland like other baby food that we have tried i love the fact that they are organic and amazon sells them at such a great price ,my baby loves these , great product
my month old son is not the picky eater my first was he had only refused one flavor of all the baby foods introduced to him in months and it was peas can t blame him for that one but he refused to swallow the rice lentil flavor in this variety pack he actually spit it back out and then blew raspberries cute but messy i tried several times over weeks and got the same response each time we will not be ordering this pack again even though he loved each of the other meals ,good variety but may not be for everyone , my cat loves it
i did like this product until some jars i found black mold on the inner lids br br i read other reviews but i thought it must have been a bad batch i was wrong br br earth best used to be very good so i canceled my next subscribe and save order then i feedback cancel reason to amazon ,some jars bad , not as good as it is
i used this variety pack to introduce protein into my daughter diet she loves all four of the varieties ,great variety pack , great product
this is a nice variety of flavors two are meat based chicken and turkey and two are vegetable based summer veggie and rice lentil my month old daughter eats all these flavors and particularly likes the meat flavors i have had difficulty getting her to eat other meat foods so i am happy to have found two meat meals that she loves as with other earth best varieties these varieties include only organic ingredients without any of those funky preservatives ,good variety good flavors , great taste
great value if you buy it as a subscribe and save item and i love that it automatically comes to me these are great and they taste really good making me think that we bought a very high quality product for our child ,my loves this food , great taste
i love earth best my son eats almost all of the earth best single and combination foods this pack in particular has two of his dinner lunch favorites summer vegetable and brown rice and lentil some of the dinners and a lot of the first are very runny so we mix with some cereal to thicken ,one of our favorite variety packs , great product
my son loves earth best baby food he enjoys his vegetables as much as he does with his fruits he has no problem digesting his food and never spits it up ,best baby food ever , great product
my son really enjoys all these flavors eats them all fast shipping no shopping in stores great prices would recommend to all ,love these , great
love earths best but my old daughter only liked one of the selections i highly recommend buying just one of each from the store and having your baby test them before buying these in bulk walmart usually has them for each ,great product but bad selection , great product
i was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews i was not really impressed when my son tried the food the consistency was way too thin and my son would hardly eat the whole jar i would recommend making your own baby food or use the gerber organic ,not my favorite product , great product
our pediatrician told me to include some form of meat at dinner for our baby unfortunately two of the four varieties do not include meat i do not think summer vegetable should be included in a dinner variety pack that is what the vegetable variety pack is for also the chicken and sweet potato is extremely runny and hard to feed to a baby ,just okay , great product
of the flavors are pretty good but the sweet potato chicken is pretty gross i was wondering why my daughter did not want to eat it until i tried it myself ,not too good , not as good as
my baby did not seem into these dinners so i tried them they are not terrible but not good either we will stick with the eb fruits and veggies until she is ready for table foods ,not so tasty , great product
this is great organic baby food options delivered to my doorstep the dinners are a good combination and receive a raving review from the at the dinner table ,food delivery , great food
my little guy loves to try new foods so this variety pack is great br br feeding organic is the way to go we trust and love the earths best brand br formula is great amazon com seems to have the best price around i checked br br it is great to get the auto ships of less trips to the store for dad ,dinner time is best time , great product
we ordered the earth best nd dinner variety pack along with the fruit variety pack we got the fruit variety pack and an oatmeal and fruit variety pack not the dinner pack found out we cannot return the item either we will try the amazon phone help but if all else maybe my little one will like this stuff ,wrong item shipped , great product
my baby loves this food at whole foods they sell the same flat for and thats retail i ordered this and just received it today i had not even opened package and i could smell a rotten smell coming from box i opened it to find jar smashed and mold everywhere i am so disgusted and cannot believe i waited over a week for this to arrive what a waste of my time the worst part is i ordered the fruit flat as well and also a broken jar and rotten mold everywhere i do not get how this happens the shipping box is not dented or damaged neither is the flat box so what someone packaged and sent a smashed and rotting shipment not a happy customer ,waste of time , great product
your child regularly they will develop a sweet tooth quickly and will start pure vegetables other good things because of this there is no need to applesauce or other sweeteners into other foods that is just and there is only one reason for it so the child will eat it and only want this brand br br best advice if you must buy pre made food be sure the ingredients are just the main ingredient s and if needed water that is it do not buy a vegetable that has applesauce or another silly ingredient added just to make the child love it and want that brand because it is sweetened br br shame on earth best as a company kudos to their marketing department for creating a name whereas consumers will automatically be drawn to them because they think it is a great product based solely on the name ,agree with the other , best of the best
the package said the ingredients included black tea non dairy creamer extract refined sugar i have never considered putting non dairy creamer into tea would it be a mess i dumped into the mug stirred to death instead i found all the ingredients in an traditional paper tea bag held in a foil like moisture proof package br br after steeping mins i was thrilled to discover a light flavored cup of tea slightly fruity with a soothing feel to it and no floral tones to the taste and no stirring no clump at the bottom of the cup br br a year later i found one of the packages in my found it just as tasty easy to prepare as last year i went online to buy some more was thrilled to find that amazon offered the same item a couple of other flavors by the same company too ,fruity unique good balance , not bad but not great
these are probably the best crackers i have ever tasted they came in a christmas gift basket but i liked them so much that i had to google them to see how to get more this variety contains oregano and garlic powder because of how thin they are there is nowhere for the flavor to hide try them with smoked i highly recommend them ,yum , great taste
along with several others without running the ingredients by my wife first a nurse of years she br was surprised when she noticed it we went a and poured my order down the drain afterwards there is pure and then there is not so much br br from the website br br propylene glycol br br a cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic and fluid and in the skin and hair propylene glycol works as a which causes of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water the material safety sheet users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin can cause liver and kidney damage br also used in br br br rubber cleaner br de br stain br br br paint br br br br i wrote the company about this concern and they never responded ,we out , good product but
since being diagnosed with high blood pressure this product has been a staple in our home i especially enjoy the grilling blends for the price i got it for online it was a great usually much more expensive in store so buying in bulk from amazon is the way to go ,love mrs , great product
received bottles of concentrate from mixed exactly to their and was extremely disappointed in four of the six flavors br br i am truly to have to encourage you to not purchase the watermelon flavor br br this item has be returned for a refund ,very weak flavor not , not as good as it is
ground arabica beans not my favorite but not bad for a light medium brew smells wonderful as it is out of the machine smooth and not bitter slight floral aftertaste ,good light to medium brew , good coffee
i purchased some of this special habanero sauce this past year for my super bowl party it was a hit i thought i would try the mild since i like some zing but did not want to burn my mouth off it was a great mix of some spicy zing with a sweet overtone went great with chips as a dip as well as really good with as a dipping sauce with chicken wings br br i am thinking about using this as a glaze as well for an upcoming pork i think this sauce is a great change of pace from the person who is sick of the same tastes that you get from the same stuff in the local grocery stores plus it is from a small business win win win br br thanks again sauce for a great change of pace ,a change of , best chips ever
mild sauce is like a condiment it goes on everything and does not take over the flavor of the food but enhances it i use this sauce on burgers shredded pork grilled chicken baked chicken eggs as a pizza sauce substitute and basically anything my kids love the mild kick and flavorful of the mild sauce my and year old put it on everything and rave it will change your cooking and challenge you to try it on everything ,by the whole family , best coffee ever
i have to say without a doubt it is the next best thing to put on food i will start off by saying i do know the maker of this sauce and although that may seem like this review is a bit biased i wanted to be the first to state the flavorful blend of this sauce can literally go on everything br br i like spicy and unlike other like red hot this does not mask the flavor of the food but adds to it br i have used this sauce on hotdogs hamburgers chicken tacos and eggs br br the mild is a little bit sweeter than the medium and hot the hot being the heat that i particularly enjoy but this stuff can be added to almost any sauce or family recipe to give it that extra kick of spicy sweetness that will make your mouth water ,this stuff is the on everything sauce , this is the best
i have been a huge fan of jelly since i was a kid which was about years ago i have always had a favorite at first it was peach then banana juicy pear came along and that was my favorite for about ten years i thought nothing would top it ever then i tried red apple it is sweet and tart and really delicious my new favorite flavor a ten pound box is surprisingly tempting and i am sorry they are currently all sold out ,my favorite jelly belly flavor , great product
i was not sure what to expect from this jelly belly flavor i have eaten red apples before but they were usually in a fruit this was a bean with red apple flavors put inside despite the obvious i tried this confection because i am not afraid of the unknown like so many people in the right wrong i was surprised to find that this red apple had a delicious apple like flavor and a chew not unlike a finely prepared would i eat more of these yes i would i would also recommend this red apple to anybody who is and wants to experience a new and exciting way to feel the best parts of the fruit eating process red apple jelly beans they do taste like apples kind of but not completely still pretty good ,a blend of bean and , not as good as i be
this jelly tastes heavenly you wont find anything this good at the grocery store all i can say is i will be ordering more shortly ,delicious , great taste
give them a fair chance to explain something i likely would not have done if i was not writing a review their office was closed am pm est not the most convenient times for a working parent but i will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly br br updated old br just spoke to someone from customer service she says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is bpa free but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner that does contain bpa but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food i am sure not everyone will be okay with that answer but i am ok with it i still think it should be an answer that is readily available to consumers without calling them but i will say there was no hold time at least ,bpa no longer an , not bad but not as good as it is
here is the response i got to my emailed question about bpa in the lids of their glass jars br br while all of our earth best foods were and are safe earth best organic jarred baby food was converted to packaging that does not use bpa in october br br that satisfies my concerns they include a number if people have further questions please feel free to contact us at through friday from am pm mountain time br br i do not know why they do not advertise this on the packaging website etc it would a lot of parents ,now bpa free to earth best , great product
awesome baby food i bought it online to save a few bucks but some of the jars were broken when they arrived stars for the food star for packing and shipping quality ,awesome food but arrived broken , great food
my little guy ate this all up before i could even write a review ,great deal , great product
i was disappointed to find out that the lids of earth best jarred foods are coated with an lining that contains bpa br i thought i was avoiding the whole bpa issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers if it is in the lids it is going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging shipping storage etc i was planning on being a devoted earth best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass but then i found out about the bpa as a note if bpa does not bother you most of earth best food is tasty ,bpa in lids , not as good as it is
packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten however amazon com does not let me return it this is not right i have put the pic of the food on packaging review page buyers should all take a look at it ,the food was , great product
a great idea but i was not a fan of this particular variety my son would have been just fine with it but unfortunately for us at this point my daughter is allergic to raspberries and mangos these are both things i think she will grown out of but something you may want to consider when purchasing this item i would suggest trying an individual serving of one from your local store to see if your child has an allergy but if they do not i would say buy it other than that i do think it is a great variety for kids who need some changing up occasionally also the subscription price on this variety is great and can be depending on how soon you need it we ended up running through another subscription we had and were able to have another shipped as soon as we needed it ,best baby food by far but we have some allergies with this one , great taste
just off the phone with them and they said that yes they stopped putting bpa in the liners in of course there is old stock on the shelves so i asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the old with bpa or the new without bpa and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid if it is all white then it is bpa free if it is metallic or gold then it is the old lids which did contain a bpa layer thought this might help some of you out there ,with customer bpa , not as good as it is
i love earth best products that is the only product i use for my baby my baby loves it and i never had any problem with it it organic which makes it all that much better ,i only use earth best products , great product
i would continue to buy but i am moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars too many they like all the flavors though great textures too ,organic and tasty , not as good as it is
i ordered this because i really like this brand and i have never had any issue with them my son usually like all the flavors i ordered this and the pears were sour spoiled the other flavors my son refused to eat i am sure there was something wrong with it so i am not sure what happened but i will not be buying these online anymore ,never again , not as good as it is
i love these foods my first son devoured them happily and now my second son also loves them this fruit mix has a great variety my sons both love the peach oatmeal banana best overall a great product high quality ingredients and they do not taste half bad i of course had to try them if my boys loved them ,great food , great for
several broke during transit causing mold to grow over all the other jars jars are cheaper at walmart ,packaged , great product
my month old loves these he hardly one bite before he is already opened his mouth for the next bite i make my own baby food when i have time but when i don t this is a great alternative ,baby loves these , great product
this was a good buy the variety is still close enough so i did not have to worry if baby will like the next one ,good buy , great product
i am a strong believer in giving my baby organic foods as much as possible we used many of the earth best flavors and baby really enjoyed most of them what i found irritating though was how runny many of the flavors were i often had to add oatmeal or rice just to keep the food on the spoon water is added to many if not most of the flavors i wondered if that was a necessity however plum kitchen and happy baby brands also organic do not have water as an added ingredient we definitely used these but to be honest i the other brands because i felt we were getting a better value considering we were not paying for water in those packages ,added water , great product
i am not the one who eats these so i cannot give the best review but my son gobbles them up so i will take that as a star rating from him and i give it stars since i know it is organic and i do not have to worry about what he is eating now if i were to review his vegetables i might have to deduct a star for him but that is just because he does not seem to care for peas much ,great for on the go , great product
the baby can be such a hassle br br earth best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non organic foods like gerber the textures are good but i had to stay on st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all nd foods made my son gag i had a similar issue from nd foods to rd foods sprout baby food however is the best quality i have tried for freshness aroma and taste it reminds me of fresh produce while i have seen it in dixie for the same price as earth best it is much more expensive on amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online i am going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it but i will probably always keep a few jars of earth best to get by in a pinch ,best every day price , best baby food i have ever had
i love getting this case it actually saved me money by buying it this way and my son loved the fruit varieties i felt good about giving him this because it is organic the price is also good for the product ,best for my baby , great product
we just started using these and my month old daughter really likes them i have tried a couple of bites and they are tasty with good flavor combinations i love that they are organic my only complaint not specifically related to the product is that when i got mine in the mail one of the jars was broken and i had to clean the food off of the other bottles ,a hit with my baby , not as good as it is
my one year old loves this product she eats one every day and never gives me a problem and i trust the ingredients which me that she is eating something thats good for her ,great product , great product
i have a habit of trying everything myself before offering it to my lo with this product i am sure that i am providing my lo with good nutrition and good taste br he simply loves it ,my baby simply loves it , great product

our baby loves loves this food we actually mix a jar with scoops of rice cereal for breakfast and he gobbles it up earths best is the best ,yummy flavors , great product

i was very pleased with the price of this product and the shipping speed was fast i like that i did not have to this back from the grocery store thanks amazon ,excellent price and great food , great product

my baby loves earth best product the food is tasty and does not cause her constipation problem i am happy that i can find the organic and affordable food for my baby ,great baby food , great product
we make our own fruits and veggies to use at home or at however storing them while we travel is challenging so we use the earths best on trips the flavor is wonderful the ingredients are simple and organic and we feel good giving this to our month old she loved all of the flavors in this variety pack so much that we are trying to them at home we also keep these in the pantry as back up ,wonderful alternative to homemade , great product
i am loving earth best brand overall i set out with the goal of making all of our son food however when i returned to work full time the puree time was less so my go to is earth best baby food we are on stage two now almost stage and he loves them i appreciate the no added sugars preservatives and that it is mostly organic he loves the taste and good stuff great product love it ,best baby food out there if you are not making your own , great product
the flavor combinations are good and taste pretty good too i did not give it stars because i thought the consistency of the pears was a bit thin and runny for stage that is easily solved if you mix the fruit with some cereal my little girl loves them ,great flavors , good but not great
great value if you buy it as a subscribe and save item and i love that it automatically comes to me these are great and they taste really good making me think that we bought a very high quality product for our child ,my loves this food , great taste
we love earth best its hard to beat their variety of flavors and organic offerings you can also buy a vegetable variety pack gourmet meals or my favorite the seasonal good price on amazon too especially if you do subscribe and save ,yum best baby food , great product

i bought this for my year old and he loves it just as much as the other organic brands we have purchased but i got this one for less great buy ,great product good price , great product
beware of what you are being charged it says that it is but is you plus in shipping i ve found this to be true for several other items on this site br i m not sure if this is a misprint amazon does not seem to think it is an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item i disagree and think it is amazon to get to the bottom of this ,of the price , not as good as it is
my son happily eats all of the fruit veggie varieties of earth best unlike the organic baby products none of which he likes at all br br be careful to only get the fruit and veggie variety packs not the dinner packs as they have meat in them ,good stuff , great product
i just called up customer service and found that since october all the jars are bpa free but the jars manufactured before october are still available in the market usually all these products have a long shelf life as they are vacuum sealed so the jars with bpa lining on the lids are still floating around in the market the consumers cannot tell the difference so what is the point in buying this when you do not know if you are giving your baby something that is bpa free or not this is very very disappointing from earth best ,not bpa free , not as good as it is
i usually feed earth best baby food to my grandson he has never had a reaction of any kind to any baby food i have given him this is the first time i have tried this particular variety pack i fed him the peach oatmeal banana and apples and apricots for breakfast this morning shortly after i noticed he was scratching i looked and he had a rash i remembered reading a baby food review where someone mentioned an allergy so i checked and yes it is this variety pack i do not know what is in it that would cause this type of reaction unfortunately i fed him two different jars so i do not know which one caused it but i do not want to take a chance of him having another one so out they go just thought i would let others know ,love best , great product
i was reading the other day about which items you buy organic br and fruits and were the top of the list so it br on me what have i been feeding my baby we changed to earths best br i feel better feeding the best br also we use earths best formula when we changed our baby now br thru the night and that makes me happy ,best is the best , great popcorn

amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and on time but i guess this is one product that they can not br br several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out i wish i could order this by mail but it seems this is one item we will need to go to the grocery store for ,product is good amazon is poor , not as good as it is
i like their variety package but also heard that there is bpa in the lid i will switch to other bpa free products ,bpa in the , good
there is bpa in the lids and company claims it does not touch the food so it is why do they even write organic times around the lid not honest to their i would not even give star if l could ,organic with bpa , not as good as it is
i have a month old who eats food all of the time i bought this variety pack and noticed that the peach oatmeal is thick like a paste as i was thinking that as i was feeding him he started choking and for air he could not breathe and i had to give him the and luckily he started crying very scary and those jars went right in the garbage ,old on oatmeal , great product
this food is phenomenal but way overpriced i pay a case in new york city and it is often on sale for less than a case at in new york city grocery prices are in ny so if i am paying less here this is no deal ,overpriced , great product

small bottle of reasonably priced coriander in grocery stores which folks even more from experimenting with this tasty and fragrant spice the frontier coriander powder is wonderfully citrusy and robust full very rounded and well balanced and very palatable mouth watering flavor with hints of lemon not extremely overpowering of all of your other flavors in whatever your making either which is very nice because this allows you to use it liberally if wanted it goes good on meats and vegetables and also smells great when you throw a handful in the bbq smoker and let the coriander smoke do its job on the meat and veggies on the bbq the frontier coriander powder is of exceptional value and quality if you like coriander and think you would like to start experimenting with it in your recipes i would recommend buying some and re discover the world of delicious coriander ,fragrant and very fresh , good for you
quality i could just use a double or triple amount because two pounds br br anyways the coriander itself comes in two pound metallic bags so far i have only opened one and the other is in my freezer the coriander is fragrant and flavorful even better than i expected the only danger is that i might as i eagerly throw handfuls of the stuff into everything i make why because i have two pounds if i ever run out i will definitely consider buying this again br br the only real con is that there is so much coriander that it might take too long to use and lose flavor over time i honestly do not think that will be a problem for me considering how much i use but it might be smart to split the order among multiple people for this price you really cannot go wrong ,oh my of , good product but
after coming back from living in england for several months i me some coriander carrot coriander soup coriander spiced but even in the bay area this spice been surprisingly hard to find especially at a decent price br br buying it in bulk from this seller the price is unbeatable and the quality seems comparable to the name brand top notch stuff in england one thing to note is that the coriander comes in metallic pouches not resealable so if you want to keep it in a resealable bag container you will have to provide your own br br also i wish i had found someone to split this with me since it seems like even bag will last me forever ,great value , great product
unless you can use it all plan on sharing great ingredient for my spice mix recipes and any dish you might want to spice up ,on this , great product
the quality of these spices is excellent and rather than buying smaller amounts at huge cost and inferior in quality at a supermarket this is really the way to go i store unopened packages in the freezer for freshness along with cardamom this is a spice i use daily so i appreciate the deal here ,convenient and , great product
happy with this purchase it is a good deal it is the most fragrant coriander ever coriander is a super spice and a health supplement as well research it it is a ground cilantro seed we use it in lots of dishes br thank you ,great quality spice , great product
this is the best tasting brown rice i have ever had kind of a nutty flavor this is the only rice i have ever had that tastes great all by itself ,fantastic , best ever
this is ok rice it cooks fairly well in my cooker not as good as some other tho but the taste is really very earthy i do not mind that too much but this is almost too strong tasting ,ok but very very tasting , not as good as it is
i love basmati rice and to get the organic is the best this product is great tasting and the aroma was amazing the only reason that i will not purchase it again is the amount in the package is very little and for as much as i steam rice for not only my kids and me but our french it is just not enough for the price you have to pay way too expensive so i go to vitamin cottage and get the organic brown basmati rice in a lb bag for great deal and great product ,amazing rice , great product
this product is very good i have really been pleased as usual of amazon it arrived in good timely fashion thank you ,organic brown rice , great
i eat brown rice quite often and found this to be relatively flavorless br it cooked very well in my rice cooker but did not that wonderful nutty aroma and flavor the grains are finer and have less body than what i have enjoyed in other brands maybe personal preference would not try again ,disappointed , great product
i just picked this up at my local grocery store because it was the only organic brown rice they had and i was pleasantly surprised it cooks really well not sticky at all i use a bit of coconut oil and cook it in organic vegetable broth tastes great i am not typically a brown rice lover but this kind was really good my kids and husband ate it and asked for seconds as well was delighted to see it on amazon and for such a great price with subscribe and save ,love this rice , not as good as it is
it is great thin and tasty brown rice just follow the recipe on the packet and it cooks perfect thank you ,delicious , delicious
being extremely kind in their review br this is not even fit for farm animals i have lived in hawaii most br of my life and have shopped mostly in the local health food stores so i have had br many many different batches of basmati rice what amazon has sent me is not br edible in my opinion it is not long as basmati should be and does not br cook as it should it fully cooks too soon and does not need the full amount of br water that basmati usually does br i am tempted to contact the fda to see what it really is br br my to the reviewer from florida i should have listened to you and br passed on all this frustration amazon does not allow returns on groceries br needless to say i am now stuck with several pounds of inedible rice ,you have got to be , not as good as i be
here is a great way to get that tast of your childhood without all the sugar br even without blood sugar problems i want to cut back on any excess sugar br this allows you to have a drink option other than water with a taste that br is low calorie and sugar free br br parents dont tell the kids and just serve it they will never know the br its that good ,taste of , not as good as it is
i love fact that this drink is neither too tangy or sweet the of both is perfect and therefore quenches thirst without leaving an after taste t ,my favorite drink , delicious
my entire family and my extended family love the entire product flavor line why have they taken this product out of the stores several large food store have taken the products off their shelves why ,love it , great product
we absolutely love the sugar free cherry kool aid but have a very hard time finding it in stores br when we discovered it on line we bought a bunch it is a wonderful product hope they keep making it br delicious ,love it delicious , delicious
i was going through about per day of various soda drinks switching to this has really brought down my caloric intake and i have dropped about kg with this being the only change in my diet ,great alternative to pop , great taste
because it does tend to stain but any traditional stain did just fine at preventing the stains from setting in to carpet clothes and br br the sugary alternatives and you can save of calories per day just by using this instead cutting calories just became a lot more easy br br edit i still use this product multiple times a day it is great to have a drink in the fridge that you can go to that tastes great and you do not have to worry about calorie intake or getting the kids all up from sugars i also took packets on vacation and mixed it on site saved time and money instead of stocking a fridge up when you would just have to throw away the unused portion at the end of the trip i just wish they made a orange and maybe a berry flavor as well ,tasty drink mix , not the best
i cant keep enough of this in my house my kids drink it like its going out of style i love it cause its so easy to make just water and the packet the best part is that is sugar free ,get enough of it , best ever
the tropical punch flavor tastes just like i remember as a kid easy to use and fully dissolves in cold water although i will use a or knife to stir the mix while the water is filling ,tastes just like i , great product
i love this kool aid mix and they stopped selling it at my local luckily i found it here and it is even cheaper than it was in store ,yum , great product
was looking for a way to bulk purchase sugar free kool aid this fit the bill and then some i am trying to cut back on soda for the family so this was an excellent way to do it cheaper than the store although not by much and always available something the local grocery store could try this was my second set of these and they are just as fast and just as good as the first oh and the sugar free part cannot tell the difference great product ,great and fast shipping great product , great taste
i chose to purchase in quantity as it is cheaper than the grocery store i liked the product so i knew what i was getting ,cheaper than the stores , great product
i am glad to be able to get one of my favorite drinks again for some reason a few years ago all of the stores in my area stopped carrying the sugar free i like the new pouches that are in the tubes rather than the old tubs that were they are easy open and pour nicely into the bottom of the pitcher there is less of the stirred up into the air from the pouches as they stream the powder out rather than it just dumping in a blob from the tubs ,from store , not as good as it is
great basic hydration for summer satisfied with the amount of sweetness i mix with water and ice cubes for instant satisfaction ,great for summer , great product
i have been having blood sugar and yeast issues and i have had to cut out sugar i had never tried sugar free kool aid before so i was a bit nervous about this one luckily i found the taste to be really good even my picky kids love it br br i love the fact that these come pre sweetened in individual pouches you just tear one open and stir it into quarts of water it could not be faster or easier it even dissolves well in cold water br br i just ordered a case of the cherry flavor too my kids and i cannot get enough of the tropical punch flavor so we are excited to try cherry too ,tastes great and really easy to use , great product
my local stopped carrying and said they could not get this product any more so happy to find it on amazon com ,convenient way to get , great
to us while we sat in the so i was very pleased that amazon offers this since it is getting harder and harder to find in the seattle area i do most of my grocery shopping on line at safeway and they do not offer it or any free kool aid flavors i think the price is a little high but i ordered it on sale and also subscribed to have it delivered bi monthly so the price is more reasonable i also purchased the grape flavor but tropical punch is still my favorite next time i will get the cherry flavor because i like it mixed with crystal lite lemonade it very well in cold water and to me does not taste sugar free at all and of course it is even more refreshing and delicious served up in my vintage kool aid pitcher and little kool aid cup ,my sugar free drink , i love it
i would never buy this cake it looks horrible some of the fondant work on this seller other cakes is the is horrible worse than a cake you would buy at the grocery store the flowers look like red and green how can you possibly think you should sell these to people ,really , good stuff
about a week ago and wanted to try some different flavors without committing to an entire box it was fun picking out all the flavors i wanted to try if you go over to her website there is a much easier to read list of flavors and types of coffee that she has in stock after purchasing i immediately sent an email to the seller with my flavor i received an email response shortly after and everything was packed and ready to go less than three hours later how is that for customer service and the shipping was lightning fast i just received my package today after ordering night all cups are for and i am already enjoying one of the cups i received if you are new to keurig or want to experiment with some new flavors this is a wonderful way to pick exactly the ones you want ,wonderful , not as good as i have
i have two indoor small dogs poodle and maltese and they have high anxiety especially my maltese and these seem to help even if it doesnt they sure love em my maltese before he ate it set it down and rolled all over it i think he likes it i would give it stars but its just a little pricey ,my dogs love these , great for
this product is very flavorful and you do not need much of it in your recipe it is really strong it is organic ,organic , great
it is got the typical taste which to me is it is just peanut butter however the single serve containers are convenient and transport well the consistency is great it is not runny yet it is also not a solid a peanut butter with floating oil either good for dipping pretzels or celery other veggies and in the absence of a you can just tear off the top and the contents onto bread br br the price is right ,convenient it in your at work some with you , not as good as it is
maybe it is just me but i have used this extract in my oatmeal same amount as mccormick extracts and i cannot taste any flavor at all very disappointing ,tasteless , not as good as it
i used this in making a wedding cake for some friends it tasted awesome mixed into the i would purchase other flavorings from this vendor ,awesome , great product
in the attempt to make blueberry cake for my brother i used the whole bottle and still did not have a blueberry cake i added about half the bottle to the cake mix white cake not vanilla and the other half to the frosting white frosting not vanilla and it still only had a hint of blueberry flavor i was completely disappointed in all the time effort and money spent making it and it barely tasted blueberry i would have thought that using the whole bottle would have made a blueberry flavor i guess i will have to see if i can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry flavored extract will not be wasting my money on this again ,not as strong as , not as good as it is
arrived on time smells like a good addition to my baking supplies came in excellent condition will use in syrups etc ,extract , good stuff
we have been looking for that tastes as good as what we had in tuscany this is from the same region as our favorite the consistency is just a bit runny it has moderate chunks of garlic it was quite tasty ,a bit pricey but yummy , not as good as it is
packed at the warehouse and sent to the store the store did not it each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape the item it stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor the following information shocked me and i quote br br fruit oz pack retail br br did you note the price retail it did not state wholesale it said retail price no one sells it for yet the warehouse that is the retail price am i missing something here how many hundreds of dollars have i wasted i guess it is a matter of what the market will bear outrageous of course there is the additional shipping on alone i will give up on this product the is beyond br br i gave the product a low rating even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly overpriced ,something is very wrong here , not as good as i like
good stuff but may be a bit expensive in to more local products love the no sugar added but found product at local store for half the price would continue to purchase if i did not have cheaper option ,decent but found better local , not as good as it
this hit my sweet cravings perfectly definitely keeping this around yum i would definitely reccomend this to anyone wanting a quick snack that is not a lot of calories get the fat free and it is only calories ,yummy , great snack
i really liked this popcorn and the price is much better than purchasing at a regular supermarket if you have at least a microwave it is best to use power level to start with and set a for one minute until you arrive at the best power level and time for your particular microwave otherwise smoke or worse may lead you to believe this is a bad product ,good popcorn , best popcorn ever
this popcorn is great and even comes in smart pop at lower calories i always have both for the me and the grandkids ,great flavor , great popcorn
these saved so many of my baby constipation days when he started on solids the puree seems to be easier to consume than juice and we used to give it to our baby with yogurt it soon became his favorite food and his symptoms i highly recommend this product to parents who are having a hard time with their babies constipation ,to go to for baby , great product
our pediatrician recommended we feed our constipated month old he was not too thrilled with the taste but it did the job p ,does the , great product
i think has a better deal on mixed fruit packs by gerber but if your child really loves peaches this is great ,decent deal , great taste
i believe gerber may have mixed apricots with the peaches it now has a sour after taste and my son hates it ,does not taste like , not as good as
these are really awesome the flavor is unexpected but perfect gives a boost to plain old pork rinds lots more crunch with way less the calories of salt vinegar chips in addition the company is quite pleasant to deal with and all the other products i have tried are delicious and a good bargain too ,great , great chips
i found out about this spice blend in dallas a few years back when i a to tell me what the restaurant was using on the grilled shrimp br br i like this cajun spice for grilling fish recommend but store it in a dry place and replace it every year or so at least or it will lose its flavor ,good stuff , great product
we love this seasoning easy fast and great on chicken fish pork etc just melt a stick of butter and stir in this seasoning until it becomes a loose paste brush on protein and on a hot pan cast iron is best always skin side down when dark place in a oven until cooked to correct temp enjoy ,best seasoning , great product
i ordered these gummi bears after first trying them at i was a little about ordering them because of the last two reviews but i received a perfectly packaged item they were not melted and did not have a powdery texture to any of the gummi bears they are my husband favorite we have been enjoying them since we received them and i will be ordering more for that are coming up ,best , great taste
these baby gummy bears are by far the best i have ever had i had first purchased the lb bag here on amazon but i realized as soon as it arrived that it was not going to be enough however lbs on a subscription basis oh yeah ,am in love i am in love and i do not care who it , great product
i bought these to add to my easter favors i love the colors for that reason basic and all of which are different flavors i did not eat any myself but my friends who received the favors loved them i have a prime account so the gummies shipped very quickly so there was no melting going on other reviews mentioned this cannot complain about the price for a pound bag it was a great deal and if i needed buy gummies in bulk again i would definitely buy these mini bears ,great deal and everyone loved them , good for you
my boyfriend tried these gummy bears at our favorite frozen yogurt place and said they were the best gummy bears ever i them to tell me what kind they were and found them on amazon then bought a lb bag of them for him haha he wanted to go get frozen yogurt every other day just for the gummy bears anyway they are really flavorful gummy bears ,best ever , great for
these bear are great they are just like the kind you can get at novelty candy stores only much cheaper than their lb in my opinion the flavors of gummy bears are much better than bears i have not experienced any powdery residue or a melted goop as previous reviewers had my bears came to me in perfect condition and perfect packaging if you like mini gummy bears i suggest you give these a try ,delicious little , great
these are the best bears i have had we sell them where i work so i had to get my hands on some the flavors are so vibrant and just pop in your mouth ,the best ever , great
they have some textured powder stuff on them that makes them taste bad bad after taste i guess it is so they do not stick together never again ,bad taste in mouth , not as good as
so as soon as the delivery guy gave me the package i opened it ready to eat some gummy bears and all i got was a big goo of gummy bears due to the heat of the delivery truck it all melted into gel of course it is not refundable so now all i have is a bag a liquid goo thanks for making me throw away dollars good game amazon so think about if its summer or kinda warm stop and wait till december ,never tried the product just review for the shipping , not as good as it is
are smaller than a full ear they still were too much for the little guys i would say a dog pounds should be able to handle them better than my lb guys br they had a strange smell and felt slightly oily to the touch i do not know if that was something added to them to preserve them or it was natural br my chihuahuas are fussy and they liked them i was just worried about since they seemed to swallow large chunks of them they did not have any problems and my lb was able to handle them i just would not buy them again since my guys are too small the bags were a good size for the price i bought three and should have bought one bag br i rated them stars since they were of good quality just better for larger dogs in my opinion ,dogs loved them , great product
when we lived in ca we found this packaged brownie mix at our local chi chi grocery store on am we purchased them and made them that night amazingly good made with a cube of butter so be warned we went back and bought all the packages on the shelf and had the owners reorder many times for us we have since moved to another state and have been trying to hunt these down what a pleasure to find them on our old amazon order order order so they will stay available here ,the name says it all , great product
the taste is not horrible but it is not very good there is not a very good mango flavor i would not buy again ,not that great , not as good as
how can you not like this at what great price they sold it at i also split it up and sent some to my daughter it is one of my favorite cooking spices along with oregano but i tend to make alot of stews and soups one must have spice is thyme of course the oregano is for tomato sauce along with basil this was a deal ,spice ground oz jar , great product
i dont take it to lose weight this is a laxative tea as all the ones labeled weight loss tea i m very constipated and taking this tea everyday has helped me very much with no cramps or other negative effects it is strong and dont recommend it for constipation or for losing weight warning when it works you have to go ,it works , great tea
evening i was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea i looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves during internet research i discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products also the following do not take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up on it to your br br side effects can include br diarrhea br intestinal cramps or pains br rash br severe weight loss br br senna should not be used by persons with disease disease and other similar br br senna is not a daily or supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage br br i wanted to die my hurt so bad any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain be aware before you use i threw my remaining tea bags away ,watch out for this tea , great for the price
fennel tea is the best herbal tea i have been able to find and is the best tasting brand of those i have tried ,best tea , great tea
i dont like the taste of this at all i have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic cant remember exact name but think it is something like is a french company and i got it in canada and by mail order after that it is much better to my taste never there would be this much among fennel seeds as only ingredient ,awful taste , not as good as it is
i actually tried this stew i got to try this at the texas scottish festival in earlier this year at the kitchen then bought a few cans the stew was quite good considering it comes from a can probably a star rating would be stars if comparing just against other canned stews i am not entirely fair though because i am comparing it against stews i have had at irish so i have had better but still a good product in it is own right i also liked the cake from the same company ,good , not as good as it is
this is not for me it was like eating a bowl of fat not my preference everyone is different personally i dont like this at all ,could not eat , great product
this egg pasta ingredient was powdered egg product and as such not as tasty as those containing the real thing i do not like anything powdered but price was right cannot have it all i guess ,so so , delicious
my cats really like this cat food best of all i have regular deliveries in order to be sure to have an ample amount available ,chicken dinner , cat cat food
this is the only flavor my cat will eat she goes br crazy over this flavor i think because it is easy br to eat instead of a big chunk this looks like little br square slices of beef it smells good too whenever br i open a can of this she comes running she is br at me if she sees the can in my hand and i br imagine that she is saying hey hurry up and open that br can i know what you got there you cannot fool me br that yummy food but of course she is saying br that in cat language because i love her i can totally br understand what she is saying what cat lover doesn t br we definitely have that connection with our cats don t br we to her tender slices is the ultimate gourmet meal ,cat loves , cat cat food
the cats do not like this flavor i would have preferred an assortment of flavors the product itself is good i just have finicky cats and i am weaning them off wet food anyway my older cat is getting too big notice i did not say fat ,just ok , cat cat cat food
this product is positively wonderful use it anywhere you might use ordinary balsamic but use it sparingly as it packs a very fruity punch apply just a bit to some fresh berries and pour it over vanilla ice cream for a fantastic desert treat ,heavenly , great product
i had these on the airline and was so excited to not have the juice i spent a month in italy and bought the olives w out juice but they seem to be hard to find in the usa these are great since there is no juice you can take them anywhere and not worry about the mess i have been super happy with these the flavor is pretty bold so i only eat packs a week i am going to try another flavor i definitely recommend trying them i love olives and this is a great idea ,great snack but strong flavor , not as good as it is
although i like olives often i only want or due to their intense flavor these olives have a great flavor that keeps you coming back for more i love to snack on them at work and have no problem finishing the whole package each time ,delicious , great taste
these olives are delicious they are not spicy my year old son just ate an entire bag today for a snack they are not packed in juice but are moist and flavorful the bags are small enough that they are perfect for tossing in a lunch box or bag the calories listed for consuming the entire bag is only ,fantastic , not as good as you are
i was really disappointed in these olives the are very mushy and i prefer a more firm texture cat olives are much much better ,nasty mushy , not as good as it
not enough to keep me away from this flavor but it can be br br the only other issue i have is that i wish that this was resealable i do not often eat all of these in one sitting and i do not really like having to bring a second bag with me in order to seal up the portion i do not eat it would be nice if the bag was resealable via a ziplock top or a small piece of fixed to the bag i did not deduct a star for this but it is something i would like to see br br otherwise this is a great product the olives are always freshly kept in the bag and are of a good size there is no little olives here which i like because it is easy to get full when i eat these as a snack ,yummy but could do with a bag , not as good as i like
the smell alone will make you it is that good it comes with rock sugar mixed in so i do not ever use any added sweeteners ,delicious , not as good as it is
i needed something that would last a long time my dog cannot stop chewing she has to have something in her mouth she eats anything that she can get in her mouth rock plants wood chips walnuts apples these work really good i am order on line here petsmart quit caring them i also found out that pork in better for your dog instead of beef bone or anything with beef ,my dog really loves the , great for
came across lover estate tea when buying it from harney sons i enjoyed that tea very much for its flavorful and clean lightness reminiscent of an afternoon darjeeling the reason i went with the now was that harney only sells this tea in tins and i was not interested in adding a tin to my collection every time i purchased this tea br br of course i cannot be sure that this is exactly the same tea but i must say that the fell short of my expectations it tastes rather and almost flat and in order to get any kind of flavor i have to use plenty of leaves yet it still never any flavor experience that would justify buying this tea over lets say loose twinings for much less i will not buy this particular tea again and will continue to search for an equivalent to harney lover ,not as flavorful as i , not as good as i
it is difficult to find words to say about macadamia nuts milk chocolate toffee other than delicious they did not last long i am not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing ,yum yum , great taste
first yuban is my favorite coffee to be able to buy a case and save is great the coffee was in date the seals on the cans were excellent and the freshness of the coffee was excellent i will definitely buy more yuban coffee when i need it from amazon groceries ,yuban coffee , great coffee
i got a case of yuban cans from amazon for an amazing price and now that i have been to yuban i am sticking with it it is colombian which is the coffee i prefer anyway but yuban must have a special formula for roasting and grinding that results in such excellent coffee cans have the foil seals that you can peel off so you do not need to use a can opener and of course plastic lids to reseal this coffee as i scoop it into my coffee maker is half the delight just so excellent and suits my tastes perfectly buying the case is very convenient too ,the taste is as good as the aroma , not as good as i have
this is the coffee we crave in our house it is a strong brew yet not bitter yuban is the best ground coffee we have tasted yet ,absolutely the best , coffee
and a great price from amazon my wife and i had dinner last night at a very high end restaurant and while everything was we both thought the coffee was not as good as our yuban i often wonder about starbucks whose coffee i find undrinkable my son says it is an acquired taste ,the best coffee i have ever tasted , good coffee
while working as a in a high end resturant in the the resturant ran low on coffee the manager sent me out to purchase yuban and only yuban saying it was the best i have been drinking yuban for nearly years and have always found it to be an exceptionally rich smoothe columbian coffee there can only be one yuban ,in every way , best coffee ever
great price the best maxwell house makes it is a very good coffee for the price less then a can ,yuban , great coffee
i love the taste of this coffee it does not have a bitter taste and the size of the can which per ounce is the same as if you bought the large can keeps it fresher as a smaller amount is exposed to the air ,value , great taste
to the mad half emergency trips to the store that my year father makes to score the base component for his and the house guest of the moment see below daily ritual we have asked about his to yuban coffee to which he it is perfect black but better with something in it he is apparently to its flavor when mixed with any of the typical southern flavorings and and that he occasionally adds to his morning brew he is definitely one satisfied customer and it makes my life easier one less present to find each occasion so take his and my word for it br br if she only comes over for breakfast it sure seems like a long way to drive and please tell me again why does she bring so many clothes no i did not know that do tell when exactly did the recommend before breakfast ,my strong enough for a man , great product
great pre ground coffee in small enough containers to stay fresh until used i drink a lot of coffee so the convenience of having one rich enough to buy pre ground coffee means a lot to me on my own i go through one can a week so amazon let us make this a subscription be sure to check the free shipping or you might get a shock though haha br br gotta say the price has gone up on this way too much i ordered a case at and checked the local supermarket they were cents per can cheaper ,excellent , great coffee
yuban is one of the best coffees available but not sold in all areas amazon case price is unbeatable i get a case every weeks always on time ,best coffee at best price , best coffee ever
to wonder what happened to that fresh taste as you dig deeper into the can i have experienced this with other main stream brands but not with yuban original coffee the last pot of coffee has always tasted as good as the first one there is also a unique quality to this coffee that i have a for of course there will always be something better out there but it is usually at a higher price though the coffee is consistent it is the wide price range oz of this coffee that keeps me at bay with a more stars br br note br with the subscribe save option you can trim costs and be assured of free shipping previously i had subscribed to the oz cans right up until the option was discontinued by amazon i have since switched my subscription to this size and updated this review accordingly ,delicious , not bad
this coffee reminds me of dunkin donuts coffee which is all the now i like both dd and yuban about equally but i opt for yuban because of the price this is really great coffee at a reasonable price it is a light roast if you have never tried yuban maybe try one can before committing to the pack if you have tried it and like it then you know this is a good deal ,like but cheaper , not as good as i have
i love yuban is one of the better ones maxwell house is also not too bad and there are some other ones that are pretty decent yuban is rich robust and stronger than most other coffees i have tried yet not bitter overall i recommend it ,great coffee for the price , not as good as it is
and to my suprise it also was decaf i have never liked decaf but this was better than any coffee i had ever tasted we were all in for the winter when we got home we started drinking yuban decaf i have since switched back to regular yuban but my wife still uses decaf we were drinking maxwell house at the time found out later that yuban is part of maxwell house yuban costs about a penny a pot more that i am more than ready to pay for the better taste maxwell house is great coffee and my nd choice we carry our own coffee and coffee makers with us when we we live in s w and can only find yuban regular here so we order it from amazon and have had good luck dealing with them we have had several friends switch to yuban after tasting ours ,yuban original ground , not bad but not great
what can i say it is our favorite brand of coffee it is affordable and it is delivered to our door i think that pretty much it up ,great coffee , best coffee ever
yuban is a smooth rich tasting coffee unable to purchase this product in the retail stores in the chicago area the price of the coffee is very reasonable the twelve ounce cans keep the coffee fresh i am very pleased with this product and will purchase it through amazon again when i run out of yuban ,fresh coffee , great coffee
we have been drinking yuban since and find this the most convenient way to get it the price is great and it comes every month if we are having guests we can bump up the order fantastic ,yuban review , great product
we were looking for a smooth rich non acidic non bitter coffee when we came upon amazon reviews for yuban coffee well we have been buying yuban original roast ground coffee from amazon for about a year now and folks what can we say it is still the best tasting coffee around with our marvelous bunn coffee maker also an amazon purchase which makes a fresh hot pot of coffee in minutes it just does not get any better than this br keep checking back weekly to see what the going price is it fluctuates up and down quite a bit and when you can catch it at a great deal buy some you will not be disappointed ,still the best coffee , great coffee
this coffee is better than mcdonalds starbucks bread folgers maxwell house and almost as good as standard coffee that is served in up scale restaurants only and cannot be purchased it has a great smooth taste we have a hard time finding it in it is manufactured in ca on the west coast i called yuban today and they could tell me what stores in my area have sold it in the last days br you can also purchase it on line is what i did for cans the price beat the price i pay at the grocery store and i had free shipping enough to last the rest of the winter and spring try it you will love it ,yuban coffee , good coffee
very good coffee cannot always find it in our local stores so i order it thru amazon every months ,yuban coffee , good coffee
they have this coffee at where i work and before this they had this horrible folgers coffee which had to be diluted with sweetner and creamer i can actually drink this black because it is actually good it tastes like a coffee that was brewed from a cafe not just your coffee machine at home good stuff ,delicious , not as good as i be
this particular type of yuban coffee is a mild flavorful coffee that can be enjoyed in the morning or anytime it is the coffee my mother seems to prefer over all others not always available in stores i was thrilled when i found it for sale by amazon ,good to the last , great coffee
if you like strong coffee this is it the flavor is exceptional i have not found better in a can this can be expensive and difficult to find at your local store i have had great luck with amazon good price for the subscription order you can get a case a couple times a year and still get the reduced rate amazon also has a wonderful return policy br try yuban if you love strong coffee and have not found the coffee for you this may be it we have been drinking it for years now have had the original organic and dark roast i dont have a preference they are all excellent ,if you love strong full flavored coffee this is for you the best , great coffee
my husband and i recently moved here from las vegas to we have tried ever coffee on the shelves at all the supermarkets far and wide we had been drinking yuban for at least years in las vegas we called the manager for kraft and found out that east coast people do not like it or were not accustomed to it west of the is where you will find it so we had to order by the case load to satisfy our drinking pleasure we got the best deal from br amazon and it arrived very quickly without paying anything extra in shipping time to order it again ,best coffee in the u , great product
this ground coffee is almost as good as fresh ground coffee beans my husband is a coffee snob and he loves this coffee i have to admit the fresh ground is better but yuban makes a really good ground coffee do not waste your money on folger or maxwell house this is the best ground coffee out there ,really good coffee , good coffee
yuban has been my coffee of choice for years the price at amazon is very good i recommend this product for any coffee lover ,you cannot yuban , great coffee
i can no longer find yuban on the grocery it is by far the best coffee delicious flavor and no acid i would highly recommend yuban ,best coffee , great coffee
a price increase since the end of november from to is it still a bargain br br now we have passed the mark which comes out to per pound i pay per pound for fresh roasted beans in five pound lots br br if the rating were just for the price i would make it three stars ,is it still a , great product
very good product will purchase over and over again a convenient way to purchase ,up , good
i have read the reviews and i agree that yuban is absolutely the best coffee but at for cans comes to over a can that is more a can than i pay at my local store i do not understand the high price ,cost is way too , not as good as it is
i have never tasted this coffee but when people brew it in my house it makes my house smell like it might taste really good but i cannot get over the smell you have been warned ,this coffee smells like , good coffee
the jar is much smaller than i imagined via pictures i thought it was going to be the size of a jar but it was instead much smaller it is spicy though lots of jalapeno not a lot of honey mustard ,small but spicy , not as good as it is
my friend at work and i both eat sunflower seeds quite frequently we always try new types when we find them he came back from out of town with these a few weeks ago and we are both hooked they are definitely the best sunflower seeds either of us has had not only is the flavor fantastic but the seeds themselves are top notch first they are huge second there are surprisingly few broken or empty shells third as of yet i have never had a mushy foul tasting seed sadly we cannot find anywhere around us that sells them so i am glad amazon does i am really looking forward to trying the other flavors from this company as well he brought more back from out of town today i m eating them now and that is what prompted me to look online for a place to order from ,best sunflower seeds i have ever had , great taste
a href http www amazon com gp product b salt pepper flavored sunflower seeds a br br i found these seeds in a local store only to fall in love with them and then find the store no longer them i am so glad they can be purchased at amazon warning they will ruin your desire for any other kind of sunflower seeds great ,best seeds i ever a around , great taste
these seeds are of a great quality in every bag and the flavor of the salt pepper is very bold i love these and the shipping service from the company has been great every time i have ordered ,sunflower seeds , great for
i have ordered this product twice now and the service and product have been great would order again br price of product was comparable to others thank you ,great service , great product
these are packaged in a thin plastic package though i thought from the picture that they were packed in a roll top tin like sardines are packed in the peppers that survived the shipping were very good lightly roasted and with good tangy flavor however one of the packages was damaged in shipment and leaked red oil all over the rest of the packs making a huge mess ,good but plastic packaging , not as good as it is
bought these at a local store due to the great ingredients with none of the bad chemicals and have been waiting for them to be in stock here i will definitely buy more when they are available as they are the best shortbread cookies i have ever had my son agrees and i love that they are basically as good as you could get if you made them yourself with ingredients you can pronounce and will not kill you so delicious ,these are fantastic , good for you
the picture and description was pure butter mini shortbread round then i decided to order it because i love them so bad but when i got the package it came out at mini chocolate chip shortbread which i do not like ,a little bit disapointed , great product
i started getting this folger half coffee from amazon because our small town stores do not always have it it comes in one pound vacuum sealed packs so it stays super fresh and it just fills my canister with one bag i like not having to get rid of all those plastic cans and i have it automatically sent to the door so i do not have to deal with those last minute trips to the store and find they are out what a for rural small town people like me ,super fresh coffee from amazon , great coffee
i love this coffee i had always mixed my decaf and regular to get caffeine and now i can just buy it perfect amount for me i enjoy the flavor of coffee br br these vacuum sucked packages make it easy to store and use it keeps the coffee fresh i use then to refill another container and it works well for me ,love it , great coffee
this is a terrific deal for a coffee lover that needs to cut back on his her caffeine consumption great tasting coffee and great deal can spend over for it at the grocery store i get mine by the subscription plan for a little over plus no tax ,half , great coffee
when habanero is in powder form it does not taste the same nor does it have the same heat it is almost physically impossible to get a habanero powder to taste decent go with habanero flakes instead they taste better and pack a lot more heat ,good product wrong , not as good as it is
i love wasa crisp n light crackers as their name suggests they do have a very light and crisp texture they are still strong enough to support hummus or other spreads you may like to use however they are also very delicious by themselves sometimes you just want something to crunch without wasting a lot of calories on chips or other fattening foods and a stick of celery is not what you had in mind i keep these in the pantry all the time they are low sodium and contain just calories per cracker ,fabulous , delicious and delicious

we are trying to curb our carbohydrates the wasa crisp n light is a big help especially when you need something crisp we have and will continue to order this product thanks amazon for selling this tasty cracker ,nice cracker for those eating low carb , great product
the mild rye both are now here satisfy my bread needs without a ton of carbs and since i myself to calories two of these do little damage to my eating plan at calories each i also like to watch my sodium middle aged and almost off blood pressure meds and these do not pack on the salt br br thumbs up br br now if they could make one that is like an everything bagel an everything crispbread light and crispy version with the onion garlic sesame seed how cool would that be or maybe they already have br br update i do not eat gluten anymore so i do not buy this product these days for those who do not care about grains gluten i can still recommend it based on texture taste calories but not for me as i am trying to stay gluten free be well ,i these babies great for us great for those of us with teeth tasty , delicious
i love the light texture and the taste kind of reminds me of cereal which is a good thing it makes a great snack i use laughing cow cheese spread it on and lay down some spinach or with smoked sardines or tuna delicious or instead of using a to make i use these crackers and if i am too lazy to make stuff i just snack on it by itself ,yum , great taste
the title just about says it all these crackers crispbread if you will are light and airy and come in around grams of carb each i cut them into pieces with a sharp knife and use them for dips as well as for cheese and other goodies they have become my favourite snack yes they are bland but i like the fact they pick up the flavour of what they are served with and do not overpower ,wonderful low carb light and crispy cracker , good for you
these crackers are very delicious have a wonderful texture adapt well to any spread and they are only calories each great for people watching their calories they are very satisfying and they contain whole grains in a tasty form ,a product , great snack

both my wife and i have been using this product for well over a year we love it it is one of seven or eight varieties made by this producer recently each of the other flavors have been available at our local markets but for some reason these markets have been unable to obtain this flavor i was excited to find it on amazon com and obtain a generous supply with no hassle and with convenient shipping direct to my home comparable products do not seem to have the same flavor or consistency and this one mixes well with any number of cheeses and or jellies jams at snack time ,best of the best , great coffee
these crackers are certainly crisp and light i am a low carb eater and am happy to have something crunchy to munch on while watching my carbs net carbs per cracker for if you are used to buying different flavors in the grocery store the ones that come in the kind of flimsy paper wrapping these actually arrived in a more sturdy cardboard box for the people complaining about bland taste i think the point is to put stuff on them not necessarily eat them as is i like that they have a very mild flavor so as not to overpower what you put on them you can top with something savory or sweet my favorite toppings are cream cheese ham and cheese chicken salad or sugar free preserves they are sturdy enough to stand up to spreading cold cream cheese on them ,true to their name , great product
i buy these at a local grocery store not from amazon com br br they are absolutely lovely light and crisp they are like naked cheetos that are actually fairly healthy they can be topped with most anything sweet or savory great for midnight snacks afternoon snacks or crumbled up in tomato soup at lunch or dinner wish they would make them in flavors they would beat the off most diet snacks i have ever seen ,tasty crisps , good for you

i love these so much i would give them a star i love them so much i have an amazon subscription so they get mailed to me regularly i discovered them at but they are the only cracker on the shelf that are always sold out so when i saw the pack here i was so happy br br i eat them as a bread substitute with everything cannot go wrong with the calories and they do not have a strong flavor to mask the food so really they can be eaten however way you like endless possibilities ,goes with everything , great taste
wasa has a great line of crackers but these have become my favorite they are light but not wimpy their flavor is fairly neutral so they do not with whatever you choose to put on them and for me the calorie count was the final winner only calories per cracker and low sodium a winner all the way around and amazon has the absolute best price ,up to it is name , great product

these little gems are only calories each and almost fat free and taste way better than a rice cake imho i am glad they come in packs of boxes because otherwise the husband and kids would eat them all and there would be none left for me ,these are awesome , good but not great
i love these crackers they are perfect when you want the light crunchy snack without the calories of other crackers they are good topped with or and sugar ,perfect snack , great snack
i love these light airy crackers three of them are only calories on ww just spread with reduced fat peanut butter just a light part of a light lunch i used to buy them at the supermarket but they do not always have them when i found them on amazon i was thrilled and using the automatic reorder feature saved me and no cost shipping might i add you can change the frequency of that at any time ,crackers great low calorie option , great snack
i have a tried a few of these wasa crisp breads this one was by far the worst it was in essence entirely flavorless it tasted to me the way that i expect that those little packing styrofoam peanuts would taste br br don t get me wrong it did not taste bad hence the stars it just did not taste like anything looking for a low cal snack type cracker try the wasa rye crackers now those are heavenly ,wow so that is what edible tastes like , not as good as it is
wasa crisp n light inside packaging cannot be recycled the is excellent but its inside packaging is a or type of plastic that cannot be recycled anywhere in the six states i have contacted wasa has not what the inside packaging is made of nor where i can recycle it ,crisp n light packaging cannot be , not as good as it is
i think these are a bit boring i like my cooked peas at least salty and preferably spice but they do taste like peas and my toddler begs for them peas peas i suspect she likes the i bought a single package to try them out and bought the multi pack today i think they would probably be good in homemade trail mix too ,toddler candy , great taste
great snack and good on salads it is dried peas what else can i say ,really like , great
i bought crunchies freeze dried organic peas and some other crunchies products in hopes they would be a satisfying healthy snack for my children both of my kids ages and gave me the thumbs down on taste though same reaction to the other dried veggies and even the dried fruits so my desk at work is now full of crunchies products and they are a nice quick snack to keep me going between meals i recommend them for this purpose but i think most kids will probably say no to these products given the flavor of the snacks is ok not great ,the kids no but ok by me , not as good as i have
just wanted to compliment this company on their great prompt service and the freshness of the cookies bought them to give as a gift and when i brought them home my kids ate them lol i would recommend these cookies to anyone and everyone ,scrumptious and beautiful and out , great for

my wife use to make homemade peppered gravy which would take a long time to make and a big mess also when we discovered this pepper gravy we decided that there was no need for the time and mess to make homemade as this was as close as you can get to homemade and again without all the time and mess as indicated by others the addition of other ingredients such as sausage is also quite simple we would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys peppered gravy ,best packaged gravy ever made in my , great product

we love this stuff i use it in my heat and eat breakfasts i make in advance so i do not have to cook every morning my wife uses it for all kinds of recipes including just as really good gravy we used to buy it all the time in california but it is not sold locally so we have to mail order it much less expensive from amazon even over the manufacturer for us the larger oz size is much more economical than the oz ,gravy mix oz bag , great product

i am a huge fan of the mccormick brand gravy mix and i assumed that this would be as good it isn t it is not bad enough for a but i am annoyed that i convinced myself to buy a case of this stuff instead of the mccormick ,not as good as , not as good as it is
this is such a nice change from ordinary ketchup more i have been putting it on everything it is great on eggs and i am glad i bought bottles shared some and am going through the rest pretty fast it is hard to find locally ,yummy , great taste
our local grocery stores no longer carry ketchup so went out to the internet and found it on amazon i do not use ketchup all the time for everything but when i do i like it spicy good stuff i do not know why our local grocers do not carry it any more this seller delivered the product in a timely manner as well ,love the spicy , great product
dry tea in the bag reminds me of old neither moldy nor spoiled just old in contrast the davidson keemun which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious keemun and nothing else br br given the price i knew i was and consider this a lost bet i have given the product two stars instead of one because i have not thrown it out yet i keep a supply of lipton bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of and i do not really need more emergency tea perhaps it will work for iced tea br br by no means am i an expert but i do value tea and so i hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two davidson ships quickly with value pricing and so i am not giving up on the merchant just on this particular darjeeling ,tea , not as good as i like
i bought two kinds of davidson bulk teas darjeeling and green and i was very disappointed in the quality they both make kind of a harsh tea the darjeeling is very light in color and has an aftertaste more like the green is weak and flat i certainly would not recommend them ,very low quality , not as good as it is
really good quality tea much superior to twinings as tea the plastic lined paper bag is much superior to the tins to keep excess air out this is important so the tea will not the tins look nice but they hold too much air and do not reseal like a plastic zip seal ,great , great tea
tastes like darjeeling although like one of the previous reviewers said it is missing some of the body of a good darjeeling i give it stars for taste alone but for the price i paid for it i guess it is still a solid deal br br you get what you pay for and for the cost of this tea i guess it is good ,okay tea great for the price though , great taste
beautiful clear reddish in the cup and delicious with no off taste or bite recommended without hesitation just opened the bag and i am ordering some more already ,good tea , good flavor
the price is right organic tea at a great price but that is as far as it goes i have tried about of the so far and they just lack character ,so so , great tea
i have never received anything like this from amazon before the product was packed in an old used golf ball box bizarre the cans were all dented and old looking the bowls were chipped up i thought oh well maybe the soup will taste good wrong three different flavors but they were all awful completely inedible all of them were horribly fishy and metallic tasting the worst canned soups i have ever tasted in my life poured them all out and donated the chipped bowls to charity complete waste of money ,one of my worst ever from amazon , not as good as it is
this product is delicious i will say this semi messy why not place the peanut butter in the center instead on the back the taste is great so great that i started to eat them all day not good as it ruins the enjoyment br br these are actually so good i had to stop eating them i guess i over did it br br value excellent snack for everyone all my friends love them family br br shipping fast as always with amazon prime membership days br br packaging boxes total each contains individually wrapped granola thins of granola bar but flat with peanut butter on one side seriously br br also do not ruin the granola as i did by eating every day also i notice to avoid mess just open with scissors makes a mess br br exclusively ,delicious healthy snack , great product
perfect mid morning snack for someone like me who is currently doing a meal replacement drink for breakfast one of these and piece of fruit is just what you need to get you to through to lunch ,omg delicious , great taste
have to say i used to eat the nature valley peanut sweet and salty bars then when these granola thins came out and i tried them i just cannot stop eating them the peanut butter favor is my fav tried the dark chocolate and was not too impressed but i swear i could eat a whole box in one day of the peanut butter flavor if i let myself i have read other reviews about them being messy and they are a little but that does not stop me from enjoying them they are a little crumbly and the peanut butter sticks to your fingers a little but who cares the people who said the peanut butter stuck to the wrapper must be storing them in very hot i have not had this problem at all love love love them try them you will not regret it ,peanut butter , the best
as a registered nurse who is also diabetic i especially like the convenience of the nature valley granola thins for a quick pick me up if i experience low blood sugars the best part of this product though is the taste the worst part is that the actual thin is bites and gone all deliciously though they do make a of crumbs so i suggest eating it over a or napkin do not miss morsel of this incredible product ,great pick me up keep on for , great product
these are so good and also healthy for a snack only weight watcher point and calories when i was in girl in the there was a cookie like this it was an oatmeal crunchy sandwich cookie filled with peanut butter icing the first bite i took i was back there it was so good i love that they are wrapped one to a pack and not double i eat one everyday they range from to a box in my area so the subscribe and save is the way to go i tried the dark chocolate and they are also good but the memories the peanut butter ones bring with the flavor are my favorites br br if you remember those cookies you will love these if you like peanut butter and a healthy granola taste then hit the add to cart button fast you will not regret it ,oh my goodness me of cookies from , a good snack for the price
snack however as i suspect they would get gooey if at higher than normal temperatures i just signed up for month subscription so i will not run out i did run out the first time and i missed them so now i will have enough to last a month when i bought the first order i could not find them in local stores but have not looked lately since i am using amazon subscription program note that a single packet serving is not much food but i am trying to control sugar intake and i have not found myself eating more than one at a time maybe because the foil packet is not the easiest to get off not a problem and it is not like caramel corn or oreos where i can keep eating so many that i do not realize it until the package is empty i would ,love them , good but not great
pros br these are definitely tasty especially when taken from the freezer br wheat is not one of their ingredients so they are ok for gluten sensitive but non allergic people br br cons br they contain less than of soy lecithin which is a state recognized allergen br they contain canola oil which is one of the least healthy oils on the market of nutrients and chemically processed br br may be a con br they contain palm oil which unless harvested and more significantly to the rainforest e g in i do not know how nature valley harvest their palm oil hence the separate may be a con category ,tasty and no wheat but soy and and , great taste
these are wonderful but they are small so i usually eat at at time and will melt easily and are hard to get off the paper so i keep them in the fridge love them ,love , great taste
while the product is delicious it is annoying that the peanut butter stays on the waxy paper instead of on the product you need a fork to scrape the peanut butter off the protective top sheet ,delicious but disappointing , delicious
first of all these things are delicious however opening them without making a mess is nearly impossible they are super crumbly so open the package with care i will not buy them again there are too many other good options that are way less messy ,delicious but messy , good but not great
my first exposure to patchi was in where patchi stores are found now that we are back in the states amazon is the only place i have been able to find patchi hooray the chocolates are as rich and delicious as i remember if you have never enjoyed patchi chocolates do yourself a favor and buy some ,love , great product
we have been trying several by small companies via amazon and this one so far is our favorite i added some non soy meat substitute crumbles and that gave it a very nice texture ,this is a wonderful chili , great product
purchased this product at a local store in ny and my kids and i love it its a quick easy meal you can put in a toaster oven on toast for min and its ready to eat br strongly recommend ,delicious , great product
i really love this oatmeal it is such a lovely treat quick and easy to prepare and delicious as an ingredient for smoothies and even in a must buy ,delicious , great snack
i am very excited that i have found this oatmeal it tastes great and it is quick to make when looking to go gluten free so many of the books i was reading were offering eggs as a morning breakfast item i do not like eggs so my life seemed pretty much doomed to silk milk smoothies this is a great breakfast option for me now my only gripe is that my grocery store cannot seem to keep it on the shelf so when i see if i buy a couple of boxes ,thank goodness , great product
my gf df girls love this instant oatmeal we have tried many many brands for a quick breakfast option and this one is by far the best it is a bit sweeter than old fashion oatmeal but not overbearing by any means great start to the day ,gf right , best ever
i love oatmeal for breakfast but it takes so long to prepare it and then sweeten it and add mix ins that i usually do not have time this instant granola is just about perfect the only thing wrong with it is that it is a bit too sweet when i do not have time to make oatmeal in the morning i throw one of these packs into my bag and make it when i get to work it is also a great portion manager it takes the out of how much oatmeal is in one serving ,healthy breakfast , great product
yay an all natural kids gum no preservative no dangerous artificial sweetners tastes fine and not bad for you ,all natural , delicious
on the packets how much for what size slow cooker i began with just one packet dissolved in the recommended cups of water i used boiling water to dissolve it quicker add some warmth to the slow cooker as it cooking but after pouring it over all the meat and veggies in the first pot i just did not think packet was enough as my family likes a lot of the gravy therefore i added an additional prepared packet to each qt crock pot which gave me perfect results br br this product uses only natural spices no msg g trans fat per serving and no artificial flavors br br edit another batch made for new year this time i reduced the amount of water per packet to cup vs and got thicker more substantial gravy vs the usual au consistency the family liked it much much better that way ,great flavor too easy excellent back for more , great product
my mother and i have been trying to find ground celery seed for some time now we have not been able to find it anywhere locally so i decided to purchase this product online hesitant to purchase food items online i placed my order br br the product arrived well packaged and it was sealed and fresh if you are looking for a healthy alternative to celery salt try this instead you do not get the salty flavor and a more robust celery flavor br br i just wish mccormick would package this in a smaller container again ,excellent product , great product
i have been looking for ground celery seed for at least years it used to be always be at grocery stores with the rest of the spices but for some reason stopped being there regular celery seed is easy to find but not the ground version so i found online i wanted mccormick or some familiar brand i am very satisfied with what i ordered it is very good and fresh my only complaint is that i could not purchase a smaller quantity than two large oz containers i do not use that much so gave away the one container to a friend and it will take me years to use oz container that i kept but happy to now have found hope for others that mccormick decides to package in smaller quantities ,have been for , not as good as it is
have opened a can of real fish too not in a bad way though i do not share my cats love of sardines br br one of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food i picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when i wanted to try switching to tiki cat and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines there are a few different sardine varieties so at least it her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them br br the picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily of canned food but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to tiki cat so i take that as her endorsement of this positive review ,great high quality cat food , cat cats love it
this food is so full of chunks that my cats just love they are normally on a variety of top quality pate foods but i wanted to give them something to chew on and would take them longer than a few minutes to eat this is stuff kitty dreams must be made of for sure it is for both of mine anyway ,my cats love this stuff , my cat loves it
my two feline food just love these sardines and i love being able to give them these sardines each tiny can is stuffed with great big chunks of sardine and my cats are in heaven when they get this for dinner this is super high quality cat food a huge treat for any out there who likes fish it makes a very nice change from all the tuna based foods out there and i try to always have some on hand so i can vary my cats diet ,one of my cats favorite foods , my cat loves these
it is all natural real food that you can see the difference my cat loves it so much that now we call him the tiki kitty ,my cat loves it , cat cat food
the cats love it i could live without the smell and seeing the pieces of cut up fish in it but the cats love it wish i would have purchased more the price was right and it is good quality food for them ,wish i would have bought more , cat cat food
my finicky just loves this food one of the few wet foods she will actually eat it is loved by our other three cats as well will definitely be buying this again ,food , my cat loves it
my cat loved this food for a long time however he has been picky lately it is been harder and harder to get him to eat this but the variety offered in this cat food is good and seemed to keep my cat healthy ,cat could not get enough , cat cat food
my cats are not picky eaters and lick their bowls clean of virtually anything i feed them wellness cat fancy feast i tried feeding them tiki cat on separate occasions and my cats threw up both times i thought they may have gotten sick the first time from eating something off the floor but when it happened a second time i was certain it was the tiki cat i am not sure if i received a bad batch but i will certainly never be purchasing a tiki cat product again ,both my cats up after eating this , cat cat cat food
i tried tiki cat variety pack and the only one my cats really ate well was the sardine in lobster maybe one other flavor i think the one with crab they sorta ate but definitely this one so i ordered a couple packs of small cans i feed them can per day along with their dry food they also like canned cat food and a new one called addiction canned cat food which so far they love all the flavors i got them my one skinny cat is super crazy over the lobster part but both cats eat it all nutritionally sardines are really high in which is a building block and also contains the sugar ,both my cats eat this one , cat cat cat food
she liked the food a little at first but did not want much to do with it the price is very high and not worth it if she will only eat a couple of bites she had tried most of the flavors and would always have the same reaction ,kitty was not pleased , great product
i first learned bout tiki cat while searching for responsible and healthy food for my cats i tried many different brands of cat food before tiki cat i knew i had a hit when even my cat came running for tiki cat food time they seem to like the sardines best but i am sure that every cat is different and tiki cat has so many you are sure to find one your cat likes amazon has the cheapest price for this product and it is delivered right to my door i will never have to drive to a pet store and pay prices for good cat food again ,my cats are cats , cat cat cat food
the oriental flavor ramen noodles taste okay but i almost always add ingredients to make the dish more wholesome i prepare it by adding sesame seed oil vegetables and water then adding the seasoning and noodles after the water rough vegetables like chopped onions taste better if they are boiled with the seasoning for minutes prior to adding the noodles ,inexpensive meal , not as good as it is
tried this in a turkey burger and it was sooo good i definitely recommend free salt can be added or better yet add a sprinkle of goya ,yummy , delicious
extremely good deal i placed the order on got the package on saturday the packaging is very good vanilla beans are vacuum packed as well as comes with a heavy ziploc bag for after you open the vacuum pack vanilla bean is about a little over vanilla beans every grocery store i go whole foods etc etc that carries vanilla beans usually only sells them in packets of vanilla beans for typically so if you buy vanilla beans at a time for each thats so basically you are saving ,very good price , good but not great
is in the seeds and that is the reason the bean is split and the seeds when used these beans are very fresh as shown by their as beans grow old they dry out and get brittle still usable but not as good they come sealed in a vacuum bag and that is inside a zip bag even through the double packaging the scent is very noticeable and complex br br this is a large quantity of beans if you are not going to use them rapidly i recommend into two or three bean lots and vacuum packing those for optimal shelf life i keep mine in a wine refrigerator it gets cool but not cold where i keep my or pounds of various chocolates br br this is an excellent deal on good quality i just cannot figure out how they manage to make a buck on this one ,high at an excellent price , good but not great
there are a ton of vanilla beans in this package they are supple and so fragrant you can smell them without breaking the seal truly a fantastic deal ,great value , good
just received my beans today and wow there is an amazing amount for the price paid they smell absolutely fantastic and came vacuum packed so they will keep practically forever ,amazing deal , great product
this product smells so bad that i could not even try to consume it it smells sour and rancid and is detectable even before the package was opened the seller has a no return policy so i am out the i spent on this as it will go right into the garbage ,smell is awful , not as good as it is
i purchased these with the intent to make vanilla extract the bean arrived in a timely manner and were in a vacuum sealed plastic bag they did not smell super vanilla y when they arrived but i can attest that they were soft and pliable maybe too pliable and greasy though almost immediate of being in it is vodka home the beans left an oily residue on the top of the glass bottles the grease has not necessarily gotten worse but it has some type of oily smell that from the richness of the vanilla any one else have this problem ,if making extract , not as good as it is
recipe that i found on line using vanilla beans purchased from williams sonoma i decided to try spicy world vanilla beans rather than the much more expensive vanilla beans from williams sonoma two vanilla beans from williams sonoma in a pint of vodka resulted in a very dark aromatic vanilla after only two months i used three spicy world vanilla beans in a pint of vodka and after two months i had a liquid that looked like weak tea and had the aroma of alcohol i added three more beans and waited the results were disappointing so i added three more vanilla beans you can still see through the vanilla and it does not have the aroma of vanilla i am completely disappointed with the vanilla beans from spicy world they are totally worthless a complete waste of money i would not recommend them or purchase anything from spicy world ,spicy world vanilla beans , not bad but not bad
our favorite cooks for xmas and i have vanilla sugar in my cupboard now the fragrance of these beans is marvelous but i have the package so the beans will not dry out i may even put a few beans on the counter to make it smell like i have been cooking br br a recipe br br cheap fifth of vodka br beans sliced the long way br br remove a cook share from the vodka bottle and replace with the beans close the bottle let sit for at least a month in a cool dark cupboard br br some of the vanilla into a smaller bottle when you need a refill put another sliced bean in there and top off the large bottle with more vodka use the smaller bottle for your cooking make lots of cookies br br you can keep this up for about a year ,a and smells great , great for the price
i ordered and got this the next day planning to make vanilla for christmas presents there were beans in my package i split it with a friend because i do not think i know people who love to bake on their own they smell somewhat like raisins but in the package the smell is heavenly fingers that the vanilla works out but at what cents a bean i have not lost much and the price is so much better than the grocery store where i looked at beans for ,beans in my , good but not great
i wanted to give homemade vanilla extract as gifts and was extremely satisfied with these beans they made very high quality extract and were much cheaper than at local grocery or organic food stores i was mildly concerned by the size i only needed beans and ended up with closer to however my brother has used the remainder to make delicious vanilla ice cream creme brulee custard vanilla sugar french toast etc i have recommended them to friends and family ,excellent quality beans , good but not great
i do not understand believe the one negative review posted here why are they the only dissatisfied customer br br my lb madagascar bourbon vanilla beans came in days and the whole box had the wonderful aroma of vanilla even before opening it br my dark long moist pliable beans were vacuum packed and neatly in a sturdy zip bag br br oh the plans i have for these gems br br i ll be sure to post an update after my beans ,extremely happy with my order i am in vanilla heaven , great product
reasonable price often when i do they are hard as rocks dry and practically i was so frustrated at safeway where one bean was dry and hard as a rock the best i have found was at trader joe where i could get three beans for they were decent br br this price was so reasonable that i worried they were not going to be fresh good etc i was wrong the beans were incredibly fresh and supple i am using them to make vanilla extract and they have worked perfectly they keep well in the fridge so i am using them in everything br br the price is great but there might be too many to use if that is the case then split them with a friend then it becomes one of the best culinary deals ever br br absolutely wonderful i will buy these again and again ,great price for a great product , great product
i have never bought vanilla beans before but i have seen them in the store all dry and looking these beans are vacuum sealed and because of that are still moist they smelled great my whole pantry smelled wonderful after i put them in there and they made my homemade vanilla bean ice cream the most vanilla y ice cream i have ever had even more vanilla y than blue bell when i run out i will absolutely buy more of these ,great beans , good but not great
i just got these they are moist and gooey and fresh i actually got more beans than the they came faster than expected great transaction ,beans beans the fruit , great
far cheaper than getting them locally i figured it was worth a shot br br i m not sure what i was thinking but half a pound of vanilla beans works out to something like of them it is hard to picture vanilla beans but this would be a good order to go in on with someone or br br the aroma is incredible it is been a couple of months since we originally opened them and our pantry still smells like vanilla even though they are wrapped in two ziploc bags br br as for the vanilla itself it is fantastic if you have never tried vanilla produced yourself you are absolutely missing out there is a distinct and definite difference between homemade and what you buy at the store br br do yourself a favor hit add to cart and check out you will be glad you did ,excellent , great product
i purchased these vanilla beans to make homemade vanilla this is my first vanilla bean purchase ever i was very pleased with the quality of these beans there were approximately beans and they were large very fragrant and contained lots of caviar i could see the extraction starting to take place shortly after i split and these in my vodka i should have some wonderful vanilla extract in months thanks ,fabulous , great taste
with a friend of mine and we have both been making our own extract with delicious success at first i thought i might not be able to find use for all the beans but because i love to make my own vegan ice cream i am now totally spoiled by these beans i them into my non dairy milk and simmer it then let it cool in the fridge overnight then go about making my ice cream i never want plain vanilla ice cream without using fresh beans again no way it is too good br br what more have you ever bought beans from the grocery store it costs like for two or three beans and the beans are relative garbage these are not dry and like the ones from the store instead they are moist soft and have that delightful aroma that makes you just want to bake ,the lovely beans , great for a great price
it is a lot of beans to go through but the flavor and quality is really nice they are fresh soft and very fragrant i use a lot of vanilla bean because my family loves vanilla sauce and baked goods made with the fresh bean you must seal these very tightly to keep them soft but with care they will stay nice for months and you cannot beat the price one company sells vanilla beans in a jar and you get two or three beans for anywhere up to and the quality is not anywhere near what these are i will continue to buy this product i have ordered these before and i am still thrilled with the product ,spicy world , great product
these vanilla beans are so fragrant that you can smell them through the unopened package i used them to make my own vanilla extract as christmas gifts and they worked great do not be fooled by the product photo they look stiff and dry in the image but they are soft pliable and moist with vanilla oil ,fragrant and fresh , good for you
i was very happy with the quick delivery of this product and how fresh the beans were i am looking forward to my homemade vanilla extract once it is done brewing i would definitely buy from this seller again ,fresh , great product
i purchased these beans based on other reviews my plan was to make a premium vanilla extract for family members i purchased a very expensive vodka unusual bottles to fill and waited for my bean order to arrive i was not happy about the wait the beans arrived after the th and i rushed to open the package i could not smell the beans as others reported most of the beans were skinny more dry and a great disappointment i would not recommend this product i will be looking for another source ,disappointing vanilla beans , not as good as it is
i received my vanilla beans exactly a month ago today as soon as i opened the package i loved them they were very moist and i was very pleased at the quality of the beans i immediately used of the to make homemade vanilla extract the beans did not come with storage instructions so i googled it and read that i needed to store them in an airtight container i have used them a few times over the past month for cooking but i still had over half the package left well when i opened them this evening they were molded i am so very disappointed that i will be unable to use the rest of my beans if you are able to use all as soon as you get them then i highly recommend these beans if not then i would look elsewhere or order a smaller quantity ,loved them at first , great for a great price
having been a professional cook for over years i try to seek the best ingredients i was very pleased with this product from the moment you open the box you can smell them and they are still sealed in their bag they are very pliable unlike most of the big store ones and the seeds are very moist and easy to remove i needed to make a new batch of vanilla sugar and this was the first time i had to put some crackers in with it as the sugar was clumping within a week should make an interesting cracker too br john ,ok , not as good as it is
batches to see if it was the salt i was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour rancid smell i have made vanilla salt before so i know what it is supposed to smell and taste like unfortunately even after a few days this smell is not going away i was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts but now i need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me i am so disappointed i have not cooked with these seeds so i do not know if the taste and smell with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient i know for sure though that if you are looking to make vanilla extract vanilla sugar or vanilla salt i highly discourage you from buying this product ,sour vanilla beans , not bad but not as good as it is
got beans in the lbs package which is a great value they are moist so they are super fresh great find ,great value , great taste
i received my beans quickly and they smelled great i used all of them pretty quickly i purchased three l bottles of vodka and split the beans evenly among them they were plump and looked great i am excited to give my homemade vanilla as christmas gifts ,great buy , great taste
i received these wonderful beans today through amazon i have not opened the vacuum sealed bag yet but the fragrance is divine they are about inches long and plump and soft it looks like there are maybe beans ,good price beans , good but not great
arrived very quickly and packaged safely they are vacuumed sealed and then put within a thick plastic ziplock bag even with the packaging i could smell the vanilla when i opened my ups box there are so many beans in here a very great buy for my homemade vanilla extract ,amazing , good
i could smell the vanilla from the box it was packaged in it was sealed shut air extracted from the packaging so plump moist i specifically got this product based on the comments left from a pastry chef i am extremely happy with my purchase i will definitely be back for these again i use them in frosting and cake it is soooooo good words cannot describe the freshness you get with a real vanilla bean vs an extract they were very easy to extract the beans from ,beautiful fresh , not as good as it is
i got these weeks ago for the price i expecting much but they are really fresh and fragrant br i ve used them to make cream and creme brulee and they taste great ,great price for fresh vanilla beans , great taste
i got the beans in the prescribed amount of time and even before i opened the package i knew they were going to be great the amazing aroma of the beans was evident and only after i actually opened the packaging i bought them to make my own vanilla extract and i have to say they are some juicy beans i highly recommend them ,awesome , great product
the beans smell great and you get a lot of them if you get a pack of jars and you put beans in each jar you will still have more than half of them left over im trying to figure out what else i can do with them before they go bad ,a lot of beans , good but not great
great price wonderful product everything was as described shipped quickly and was priced great as far as i can tell i use these to vodka slice the beans down their length first wonderful ,wonderful , great product
i was amazed with how fresh these are and there are so many in a pound my only suggested would be if you have another person that loves them as much as you do you could split the cost and the beans i have so many left over beans i have been giving them away to grateful coworkers but what goes around comes around so here is to awesome ingredients ,best deal on the , good but not great
great vanilla beans at a great price i recieved about beans in my pack they are plump and perfect when i have used them all up i will definitely be buying them again i almost did not order them because of the reviews talking about the bad smell to them i am glad i did not listen to them they smell like all of the other vanilla beans that i have bought ,great vanilla beans , great taste
this is the buy of a lifetime for about beans instead of for and the flavor was great made ice cream that everyone raved about i vacuum sealed portions for future use to keep them as fresh as possible ,fabulous flavor at an price , great product
i bought these vanilla beans about a month ago to make homemade vanilla extract and also to have on hand since i always seem to have some culinary use for vanilla beans i was very impressed with the quality the dried up store bought vanilla beans cannot compare to these will be ordering more soon ,excellent price extremely fresh , good
recieved vanilla beans in a nice in a ziploc bag the smell was wonderful even through the bag my husband and i used the vanilla beans to make our own vanilla extract the beans were moist and easy to work with we were very impressed and would definitely buy the vanilla beans again cannot wait to see how the homemade vanilla extract turns out ,wonderful vanilla beans , good
i got the wonderful vanilla beans about a month ago the first thing i did was to make vanilla sugar then i put split beans in cup mix of rum and brandy i shake it every other day smells wonderful so far i am going to split a few beans to put on my stevia which i use every day i also sent a pack of bourbon vanilla beans to my year old big sister but she out what will i do with these br so far i find these vanilla beans wonderful smelly soft and tasty if you just take a tiny bite in your morning coffee ,soft and , great taste
these are unbelievably fantastic i had to share them i had so many simply the best i put the leftover pods in my sugar smells amazing ,amazing , great product
came in my only real issue with these is that mine grew mold i have never had vanilla beans do that before these seemed moist so maybe that to the issue it started as a small spot but grew so that it was on the ends of most of the beans i finally got them all out off the moldy bits and what was left br br it took months for the mold to start so if you use them quickly maybe that will not be a problem but i do not go through them that fast i have had beans dry out in the past but this is the first i have seen of mold if you do not plan to use them within months or so i recommend keeping them in a fridge freezer or coming up with some other way to stop the mold before it starts ,good but got , good but not as good as i like
these beans are wonderful and wonderfully priced split a few down the length toss in a bottle of vodka or rum or some bourbon for a few days and you have a drink great for baking make truly amazing bean cookies ,where have you bean all my life , great product
these will last a long time the way we use them but could not pass up the deal came sealed and you could still smell the vanilla stick one or in your favorite vodka and wait a few weeks we also make our own extract from them ,great value , great product
the first thing you notice when you open up your package is the delicious smell of vanilla the package is vacuum sealed but the smell still leaks out these beans are a great deal i think i got about pods in my bag and was able to make good use of them they as previously mentioned have a wonderful smell and great flavor it is really hard to find a better deal out there ,great deal for a good product , good flavor
these beans are magic plump moist potent the aroma was so rich that i could smell the deliciousness even before i opened the double wrapped vacuum packed plastic bag the best thing though is the price for this outstanding quality two weeks ago out of necessity i paid over for a single vanilla bean in my grocery store spice aisle the bean was fine but really when i saw these i less than cents a bean now that i have them and have had some home made vanilla ice cream made with them i can safely say this is the single best value i have ever found on amazon in all the years i have shopped here i am sorry the one buyer received a bad batch of these mine are perfect i will definitely be buying again ,what a deal , good but not great
i was very pleased with my recent vanilla bean purchase from spice world when i opened the box and not even the beans themselves i could smell the fragrance of the bean and see that they were in very good condition the have been very moist easy to work with and taste wonderful i cannot recommend these people too much and to say i was completely satisfied would not do them i like finding a place i can shop from that will meet my for taste and quality i have a new home ,simply fantastic , great product

i could not be more pleased with my purchase vanilla beans are a piece if you can find them in the store these work out to about cents a piece and they are fresher and better quality than the ones they also come vacuum sealed and a zip lock bag is included for storage after opening good job ,even better than i expected , great product
i bought the vanilla beans to make vanilla extract i do alot of baking and i like to use good vanilla the recipe requires moist full vanilla beans and these were wonderful the vanilla beans came in a vacuum pack that kept them in very good condition much better than buying them from the spice section of the grocery store where the jar contains to dehydrated beans and they made great vanilla extract for much less money than buying the real vanilla at the store ,no , good but not great
cannot be the price the beans have a strong aroma and tasted great in creme brulee just be sure to have an air tight jar and a vacuum is not a bad idea either to keep them as long as possible ,wonderful value , not as good as it is
i got these beans based on the good reviews and was not disappointed i also got beans in my pouch nice moist and supple pods that will make a gallon of vanilla extract great beans for a great price ,great beans for making homemade vanilla extract , good
i could smell the vanilla even through the packaging br there were lots of vanilla beans and they were all in great shape i am excited to see how my homemade vanilla extract turns out ,wonderful , good
i have ordered these before and i am still thrilled with the product they are fresh soft and very fragrant i use a lot of vanilla bean because my family loves vanilla sauce and baked goods made with the fresh bean you must seal these very tightly to keep them soft i use the seal a meal but with care they will stay nice for months and you cannot beat the price mccormick sells vanilla beans in a jar and you get two or three beans for anywhere up to and the quality is not anywhere near what these are i will continue to buy this product ,love these , great product

better than expected well packaged moist fresh and fragrant beans were just what i needed for my recipe perfect would not hesitate to order this bargain priced excellent product again ,vanilla beans , good

i use these vanilla beans to make my creamy vanilla caramel ice pops a fan favorite for my small gourmet business it is tough to find these locally for a reasonable price so i ordered these from amazon instead as a time saver i was dubious about ordering product online what chef does not what to taste touch and smell it before they decide if it is worthy of their customers but i was pleasantly surprised to receive moist vanilla beans that were exactly what i wanted i just wish they offered this as a subscription so i could have them automatically sent every month ,great product great value , great product

i was tired of paying upwards of for two beans at the local store so i thought that i would give these a try i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the beans i was expecting the usual dried out vanilla flavor i have enjoyed from the super market spice rack but these beans are so much better i used to live near a natural food store that carried an excellent selection of fresh spices unfortunately with the they closed down these beans those that i could purchase there they have a robust vanilla flavor that came through very nicely in the ice cream i made i was used to up on the beans in the recipe to get the vanilla flavor i wanted but quickly found out that i did not have to with these beans highly recommended enjoy ,great product , good but not great
true the beans were huge moist and plump with a good mixture of really big fat ones and smaller skinny ones however the most noticeable aroma coming from the bag and the beans is best described as pungent with a side of sour is that normal i have only ever used the crappy dried out grocery store version and was thrilled when i saw such a good deal on these br br can a vanilla bean expert tell me if that odd unpleasant aroma is what i am supposed to be smelling ,what is that smell , great taste
i like to eat frozen vanilla yogurt but the catch is that i have to make it myself or it doesnt get done br br these vanilla beans are amazing if you are really into vanilla or icecream ,great flavor , good

awesome tasting tea in a oz can i highly recommend this product because it taste great and does not cost a lot ,awesome tasting tea , great tea
prince of tea brand teas are great the premium oolong tea is good but i found that i like their organic oolong to taste better than the premium and it generally costs less too prince of tea is a well known and environmentally company and you will do well to buy their products ,premium tea , not as good as it is
i started loving oolong tea after i discovered a bottled product called that product is over a dollar for a ounce bottle i needed something less expensive so i tried this prince of peace brand oolong br br after a few brewing experiments i now love this stuff br br what i have learned if brewing as sun tea this type of tea seems to come out very weak if you put this tea in boiling water it may come out bitter br br i now heat up my water in a microwave until it is very hot to the touch but no way near boiling i then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes i like strong tea i have to my taste the brew at a fraction of the original cost br br enjoy br br ,excellent tea good price , not as good as i have
i drink three cups of this each day made with one oolong tea bag and one green tea bag in a large mug i believe this has helped me to lose about lbs in the last five months i drink it without sweeteners and also cold the price for this is very reasonable and the taste is mild ,great product , great tea
as to price and equal in quality to the best ,a terrific find , great product

the tea tastes great hot or iced very good for the price i recieved the package fast with no problems ,very good tea , great tea
i am drinking oolong tea because dr oz said it would raise the is still out really how would you know i have lost weight but that is because i quit drinking coffee which i added too much cream to and started working out a lot more it does not taste the all that great so i add equals and drink it after it ,using dr oz , good tea
superior flavor not too green not too black loved it from the first cup i put a hint of splenda sugar blend in mine and am substituting it for coffee these days stumbled on it in a shop but will be getting it thru amazon in the future i am here now because after tasting it i wanted to be sure i could buy it on line and have it delivered to the door again a definite yes product ,a yes product , not as good as it is
i want to give my cats as much variety as possible they are family and they matter variety makes them happy and their health are important giving them good healthy food and treats are apart of showing them how loved they are unfortunately i have to go online to find some treats as the stores do not carry the variety any more ,cat treats , my cat loves these
history to realize that i have not exactly made a out of rating gum but this new trident is so darn good that i thought i would better get in a few words on it i have tried all three of the available flavors and cannot seem to choose a favorite br br the peppermint with ginseng flavor reviewed here is definitely pretty awesome the gum has the physical profile of an old school it only takes a bite or two for the strong peppermint flavor to kick in and man does this gum last i can usually go a good hours and still get some flavor out of this stuff that makes it a good value in my book for sure br br typically for around pack at my local grocer although i have caught it on sale for under a dollar once or twice br br highly recommended ,good long flavor a really good gum , good but not as good as i like
hi i ordered this product from another website but i wanted to post a review on here since it has the same product br okay first of all the packaging looks nice and neat not messy like others just pure and simple maybe too simple br they dont give the ingredients info which is an automatic fail on the back it says allergy warning contains soy another fail br they dont tell us what the gum does does it teeth fight bad breath or what you know br br it has the word which means active but thats all they say nothing more br br the taste is like any other gum ,i am with this gum , not as good as it is
i would have to say that my dog is a picky eater i have tried all types of different brands of food and finally found one that she loves she also suffers from skin allergies and even though she is on meds i think this food has helped a bit with her dry skin i only have one issue her breath smells really fishy after she eats but thats not even a big deal anymore also the price is cheaper than other online stores like petco and petsmart plus free delivery all in all if happy so am i ,dog loves this , my dog loves it
the natural balance alpha grain free salmon meal and whitefish formula is working very good for my dog there is no digestive problems it also keeps the fur be sure to provide a lot of water for the dog as he always drinks a lot an hour or two after the meals ,a very good dog food , my dog loves it
i moved to las vegas from san last year and have been missing my peet coffee jasmine pearls tea when i saw this product i bought a shipment right away i was not disappointed i love the individual silken sachets of jasmine tea pearls it is fragrant and wonderful tea i will be buying it again ,fragrant teas me of coffee , great tea
it is in fact tea but without or other strong overtones a fine impression remains when the cup is set down and the intake of breath the sensation br br there is no settling of heavy flavors a cup is as fine and from first sip to last i also have found that this tea maintains its character despite the of waters i have used to make it some brews become distinctly unpleasant when the leaves are introduced to certain mineral rich well water or treated city water the best experience no doubt is when using filtered water but it is not to enjoying jasmine pearl br br as a wake me up tea on a work morning i would likely choose a more robust leaf however for a proper moment of relaxation or an attempt to one in the of i hope to never run out of this tea ,pure , not bad but not as good as it is
works good in the blender for shakes and ice slush br br can not find decaf in stores br br can add other flavors and spices to taste br br good for nutrition ,decaf , not as good as
i really wanted a decaf product so did not have a lot of options this powder essentially makes a chocolate flavored blended drink even when i use cold decaf coffee or espresso as the base the chocolate is what you taste when i think of an iced coffee drink i think of coffee with a hint of chocolate mocha not the other way around br br as other reviewers point out the calories is for half the packet and no milk added br br i will try a different brand next time i am still on the hunt for a mix that creates the same flavor i have experienced once in a great while at a coffee shop or like the iced blended at a west coast chain that is overpriced to have shipped and i think is available sugar free ,no coffee flavor high calorie , not as good as i have
these are so good my next order will be on the monthly schedule br very easy to make and super delicious we used milk and chipped br ice along with the mix i might try water one time to see how br that is i wish i could rate this product higher than stars ,excellent , great product
i used to go to a local coffee shop to get these drinks for about now i can make them at home for a fraction of the cost they are delicious i like the single serving packets but my husband and i end up using three packets to make two good size drinks ,coffee house drink home , great taste
this product is delicious it is the mix a lot of independent coffee shops use you will not be disappointed ,delicious , delicious
big train decaf mocha blended coffee is so very very good in my later years i find i do not tolerate caffine well and it has been hard to find a decaf to replace the coffee treats i have created for myself with caffine this is great makes a lot and will keep it in stock with auto reorder on amazon to save even more money and be certain i do not run out ,decaf delight , good coffee
this is a delicious oil the walnut flavor really stands out we keep this oil in the refrigerator to preserve freshness and taste definitely shake it well before each use everyone comments on how good it tastes whenever we use it so it is pretty in its appeal br br we make a salad dressing using this walnut oil blood orange vinegar and honey the ratio of all ingredients is e g br cup blood orange vinegar br cup roasted walnut oil br cup honey br adjust to your taste buds br mix with a blender or hand blender or by shaking the jar but a blender mixes much better especially with the thick honey wow is this a wonderful salad dressing br br by the way we use this blood orange vinegar cuisine blood orange vinegar which is available via amazon it has a wonderful flavor ,delicious , great product
i make an extended butter using this oil water and liquid lecithin it is just the best tasting spread ever and much healthier because of the walnut oil i keep mine refrigerated to preserve that wonderful taste and aroma it tends to settle out so be sure to shake it before using to get the full flavor and consistency i did not know to do this on the first container and when i got to the bottom it was very thick almost with the roasted bits amazon price is pretty fair although i can occasionally find it locally tj a bit cheaper but i must say ordering from amazon and getting it shipped straight to me is very convenient i have never had any problems with damaged or leaking containers on this product well maybe a small dent in the metal but that is all ,lovely lovely taste but be sure to before using , the best
i have used la tourangelle roasted walnut oil during the barbeque season for the past four years or so it is a great product and i will not fire up the without it along with various i will splash it on mushrooms peppers and whatever veggies i have from the garden the main dish is usually tofu but i have a special marinade for that one ml can lasts me about one season while the other two keep well in the refrigerator from what little shopping around i have done i think the price would be hard to beat ,great for , great product
aunt who has an auto immune disease and she likes the oil as well i would definitely buy this product again br br for metal container it is cheap metal and though it was packaged well by amazon com the containers probably got dented in amazon warehouse because it did not seem like the packaging should have caused the dents the way it was packaged if there was any damage it would probably only be dents to the containers so i would say expect dents with any shipment of oils if this company uses the same cheaper kind of metal for their containers dents do not make the product taste worse so i do not worry about the taste i will return it if the containers leak but that would not stop me from ordering again however the of leaking happening probably is not often if you receive shipments regularly ,and flavor , good taste but
la tourangelle roasted walnut is the best tasting oil i have ever had my old favorite was oil but this is even better and keeps longer i pour it on everything make a great mayonnaise on baked stuffed shrimp or baked fish on steak or chicken and as a topping for pasta and with some garlic parsley and parmesan cheese addictive so you will want to have it in the house all the time buy it you will love it ,one of the best on the market , best ever
wow i read the great feedback on this product and took the plunge and was not disappointed we had bought some other walnut oil at and this one blows that out of the water the flavor aroma and price are second to none br br my fav recipe so far br take a large sweet potatoe cut in inch strips like a long potatoe chip baste in oil and salt for min per side enjoy ,better than expected , great product
we have used this product before and love it so decided to send some as a gift to friends the cans were received dented two of the cans were significantly dented the cans were together but no other packaging was in the box one side of the box was torn the shipping receipt was not included nor was the gift message that we had requested our friends had no idea where these beat up looking cans of walnut oil came from or who sent them until we called and asked if they had received them shipping was also suppose to be in days was not received until day will find another way to purchase this product but not through amazon ,very packaged , not as good as it is
in a feeling moment at the grocery i purchased a can of this oil thinking to myself i would be tossing in the trash later but i was always curious about that little shiny metal can of walnut oil yesterday i took the plunge and is this oil awesome i put it to use in my pasta sauce replacing the olive oil and it was delicious the can says to refrigerate immediately after opening to preserve the oil but i do not think its going to last very long before its empty ,wow , great product
always a fan of la tourangelle oils this time the hazelnut oil was received as a gift via amazon br br not only is the oil wonderful and delicate for salads and some amazon now packages the cans to come dent free and protected br br great buy ,wonderful product , great product
i enjoy the flavor and use it for much of my cooking and add it as the oil to my home made granola it does not cook well on high as advertised but does well at medium to low heat it is health benefits far outweigh vegetable oil and canola oils i use both this and coconut oils whenever possible for flavor ,oil , not as good as it is
the toasted flavor is so much better than regular walnut oil the price is the best i can find and we store it in the fridge for longer life ,great flavor , great coffee
this is the good kind of fat and tastes great br i actually like the taste better than butter it has a similar quality rich blends well with foods and it is way healthier than butter not as aggressive tasting as olive oil br i have substituted it for butter every chance i get with good results disclaimer i am not much of a cook br br please buy this so amazon will keep it in stock for me it costs much more in stores and is hard to find ,delicious butter substitute , great taste
so happy i got this on a subscription i might even have to increase the frequency that it is delivered i have used it in everything from scrambled eggs to brownies it is not mild like olive oil but it has enhanced the flavor of everything i have cooked ,delicious taste , good but not great
i ordered a set of three cans and they showed up yesterday in perfect condition no dents so far i have made some boiled red potatoes and seasoned them with walnut oil and sea salt i also roasted some gold potatoes and english squash with the oil and it turned out wonderful the walnut oil gives it a great flavor i will be giving one can to my parents since my mom is not a fan of olive oil it will give my dad a new flavor to play with in his cooking ,very good oil , good but not great

we have been using walnut oil for many years we brush it on toast to take the place of butter eliminating much of the saturated fat from our diets it is also wonderful in salads try it tossed into greens with a few nuts and chopped stone fruit or grapes and a fruity vinegar this product is of excellent quality and amazon has a great price for it ,delicious and high quality , great product
the walnut oil has a wonderful taste to it i have used it in salads salad dressing couscous and a variety of other things thank you for a wonderful product definately worth the money ,awesome product , great taste
this oil has a wonderful mild roasted walnut flavor that i found irresistible in a salad dressing it will now be my go to oil for homemade dressings there is a recipe for right on the back of the can bought it because it is omega content is second only to flaxseed oil plus it is made in california br br definitely buy it on amazon so much cheaper than the grocery store ,good taste and good for you , great product

what a fresh smell and a very pleasant taste br it s very good for you too i use it in place of olive oil for salads and cooking ,cooking , great taste
from my very first taste but the price was not right so i searched on the internet and found this i was a little reluctant to buy cans as i thought they go rancid before i can finish but i am now on my last can i use it in place of to make other too or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and b s or seasons salt like salt over spring mix it is an easy but great green salad i do this a lot when i need a quick side anyway this oil goes well with anything and it does not taste too nutty just a touch of nice walnut flavor of course i love walnuts so even if it tastes very i would still like it br br anyway it is a great product and i will buy the same pack again ,great product at the right price , great product
this is a great oil for baking it gives a nutty flavor it also works great in dressings much better than olive oil ,oil , great product
i found the oil a bit weak in taste i had expected a stronger walnut flavor i hope it is not chemically produced like most truffle oils ,a bit weak in taste , not as good as
i really wanted to like this as it was organic and came in a glass bottle but there was hardly any flavor at all i could barely smell it and even when i poured a generous amount on my dish it imparts little to no truffle flavor aroma my truffle salt is much more potent ,weak , not as good as it is
i enjoyed the carbonation with a hint of blackberry and liked the fact there are no calories or artificial sweeteners ,refreshing with artificial , not as good as
this was not good the flavor was lacking and barely came through unlike the hint water which i really enjoy i wanted this to be good and was so excited to get it but it just disappointed ,not as good as hint water , not as good as it is
this product helped us tremendously when our year old daughter started day care she would not eat at the center and she began losing weight we started her on in the mornings as an policy that she was getting enough it worked great she stopped losing weight and actually started gaining she loves the taste especially the strawberry flavor ,great stuff , great product

this coffee mix is so easy to make and taste great i enjoy all their flavors as my kids do too hard to keep around buying a box of it at a time helps ,yummy love this stuff and all the other big products , great coffee
personal preference too sweet tastes like general foods international coffees price is great if you like that though and makes up very easy ,too sweet , great taste
this product was okay tasting my problem with it was the oz container with less than oz of sprinkles really ,too much for too little , great taste
strong dark intense strong enough for a man but mellow enough for a woman it really is a good coffee with no bitter after taste i just love it it is good with cream and sweetner with no watered down taste or just plain wish they made a decaf then i could drink it ,good cuppa , good coffee
i love taco bell grocery items so i was excited to try this new rice unfortunately it was disappointing this is more of an imitation spanish rice than a mexican rice it is tomato based and very sweet i expected it to have more of a taco type seasoning cumin garlic etc i cooked the rice for the recommended amount of time seconds and this came out very mushy and sticky mostly clumping together the flavor was too much for me since i do not like sweet rice with my tacos i would not try this again and i would be hesitant to try another flavor ,disappointed , great taste
if anyone is looking for delicious and healthy snack doctor kracker is an answer however the hard is for people with good teeth ,delicious and healthy snack , delicious
these flatbreads are definitely my favorite cracker but they are messy when i break them apart to have something closer to bite sized br br caution despite the description that they are made with spelt and good for people with wheat issues people with celiac cannot eat these spelt has gluten and the flatbreads contain barley malt i love them and heartily recommend them but please do not the nature of spelt and accidentally serve them to someone with gluten intolerance br br oh yes great price at amazon compared to my local grocery store i hope that advantage continues ,my favorite cracker , great for
with all the meds i take i have a lot of problems with my stomach i try a cracker first when nausea hits with or being the next up to bat if that does not work br br these are so wonderfully yummy that i then bought the pumpkin seed cheddar too the flatbread is great alone or used instead of bread the crunch is intense although i love it that way i keep these next to my chair and next to my bed and look forward to trying other flavors too ,yum yum yum , great product
have tried many crackers including some other dr kracker and think this tastes the best it is hard crunchy with lots of seeds on it so if that is an issue it might not be for everyone buying it in amazon pack makes it less expensive than purchasing in the store ,great healthy snack , best ever
i eat them just like this i like something with substance to it and when you eat these you know you are eating something they are healthy taste good and are reasonably priced ,great snack , good
this is one of the best dried organic crackers around highly recommend them compared to other available types of similar products ,one of the best , great taste

love these crackers and all of the dr kracker products i use subscribe and save to save a little bit of money and to insure that i do not run out i pretty much eat one every day instead of bread my current favorite topping is goat cheese ,and save dr , great snack
i like these crackers so much i just ordered a different flavor these are very crunchy and satisfying i put two crackers into a zip lock baggie break them into bite sized pieces and this is my treat throughout the day and into the evening and they are very filling i do recommend them however i do not know how well they would go over for those with because they are so crisp and because they have seeds of various sizes very good find love um ,love , great for
i am always on the lookout for healthy but tasty foods that are low in calories these crackers are good not in a omg type of good but they have an interesting yet addictive taste that i cannot really explain i would definately recommend them everyone i give them to keeps asking me for more i guess i should stop sharing ,addictive , great snack
thanks to the wonderful reviews i read about this crispbread i decided to purchase there are many other crispbreads crackers that i have purchased that taste like cardboard and have little flavor i think this crispbread is really delicious a little sweet with lots of crunch and a variety of seeds great flavor i like that it is organic whole grain and relatively high in protein it is a little different from other crackers and it is great topped with egg or tuna salad or all by itself delicious i will have to try some of the other doctor kracker crispbreads i will certainly be ordering more of these ,delicious , great product
these are the only crackers that i buy so healthy and so good eat them with a salad and you have the perfect lunch ,love dr , great
these crackers are a great healthy snack without anything spread on them my only dislike is that they are a tad too sweet for me i would like them without the molasses ,yummy all by , great snack
outstanding product i am always going to have them around far and above most crackers for taste and good nutrition ,simply delicious , great taste
each of these flatbread crackers has grams of protein grams of fiber and only calories so they are and filling by themselves however because they are so firm and sturdy they make a good base for more complex snacks br br one very simple addition is to sprinkle shredded cheese on top of a cracker and microwave it until the cheese melts seconds you could even stack another cracker on top before microwaving to make a tightly cheese and flatbread sandwich br br just about any recipe you would normally make on top of a cracker or on top of a piece of toast can work here ,a good base for snacks , not as good as it is
this flatbread is just delicious i love all the various seeds very crunchy there is a hint of sweet but in a delicious way ,amazingly delicious , delicious
i love these flatbreads i on them and then so many things on top of that to make a wonderful snack or lite meal their very crunchy and tasty i watch my diet closely since i have diabetes and these crackers are very low in net carbs in addition to tasting good the other flavors are good too i have twice now had to move up their delivery since i go thru them quick you will love em and will have fun trying different toppings for them i really like them with cream cheese and dr kracker don t forget the ,good in many , great snack

the first moment you bite into this cracker you will notice the difference this tasty crunchy organic cracker is perfect with soup or salad it is certified organic using quality ingredients the cracker is dry not greasy or oily like a typical potato chip br br comes in several different varieties and flavors br br recommended ,taste the quality , not as good as
these are wonderful so crunchy and they are made from whole spelt as well as seeds and a big helping of tasty br br i found them remarkably filling too they are nice and big it would be easy to make these the basis for a light meal adding just a few toppings br br i ordered these sight and never tasted so i had no i am very pleased and will order these again ,so delicious and whole too , good for you
these crackers rock wish company would let you buy assortment since you have to buy minimum of boxes at a time ,heaven , great
these are excellent snack crackers but you need a really good set of teeth to bite into them we have eaten them plain but they are probably excellent with cheese also the interesting thing is that once you manage to bite a piece off they are not hard to chew br br full of healthy seeds these are great for either a snack or to a bowl of soup or a salad ,super crunch , good for you
if you are not sure if you will like them try getting them at your local deli they usually have a couple of flavors and are the smaller cracker not flatbread but taste the same also over the years i have modified what i eat first i started as a lo mostly eating my favorite meats etc but my were always high so i started adding sardines more nuts fruits skipping more often some of my favorites like fried chicken but have found excellent flavorful alternatives dark chocolate almonds some sara lee breads lo carb brands of tortillas i still fall off once in a while eat out often but always get back on course i feel better and healthier actually enjoy look forward to eating all the varieties of foods i have researched over the years which i keep on hand so as not to eat bad too often ,good for you in every way , not as good as i like
these are the best crackers i have ever eaten two crackers spread with cheese feel like a meal to my belly i spread them with aged cheese omg good why have i never tried or even seen these before ,omg good , great taste

honest if you want a quick breakfast do not purchase this oatmeal but if you have time to spare or do not mind waiting for some good eats this is the oatmeal for you br br step pour some milk into a sauce pan step add a dash of salt or salt to taste step add oatmeal making sure it stays covered by milk step turn on stove to low heat not too low but definitely not too high as you do not want the milk to dry out leaving you with tough oats in pan and cover pan step do some little cleaning to built up appetite making sure to on step add more milk if oats are still too tough and let it simmer for a little while longer step get your just pour into a bowl add a few raisins cranberries your favorite dried fruit and enjoy ,cooking , best i have ever had
purchased case of cans from amazon com for bucks including shipping br good quality slow cooking oatmeal good shelf life on cans this is the slow cooking type minutes depending on preference taste is good ,oatmeal , not as good as it
pure sugar like most breakfast foods and especially grains i decided to try these long cooking irish oats we use cups water and cup dry oats for cup dry each it takes this stuff minutes to cook so it is not fast food for sure but enough it is filling adding fats couple tablespoons of cream to the serving helps that of course in any case it is much tastier and much more long lasting for keeping us satisfied than i expected and surprisingly stable on blood sugar nor has it set off cravings like most grains fruits etc do if we eat those the sugars digest so slowly in this apparently it is more solid and nutty than the quick oats i grew up with which i now consider a gummy gluey insult to true oats these are harder to find and cost more but they are worth it ,nothing like the stuff i up on , not as good as i be
of milk and buttermilk br cook an additional minutes stirring occasionally br br makes good size servings with excellent texture and consistency it once it sits a little bit you can increase or decrease the milk to adjust the consistency as desired you can also save it for up to a week in the refrigerator without much difference in taste just store in small sealed bowls each can of oatmeal makes about servings br br everyone likes to top and sweeten their oatmeal differently sugar brown sugar maple syrup raisins etc only add the toppings when you are ready to eat it not before storing in the refrigerator for my serving i like to add tsp of brown sugar a sprinkle of cinnamon about tbsp of butter and then top with chopped pecans very tasty hope you enjoy br br please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful ,simple recipe , not as good as i be
i like it it reminds me of food from my childhood not something i would eat everyday kinda like the way i feel about you need to cook them for a long time how you serve them makes all the difference in the world great for baking but you have to know the product before you try baking with it taste real wholesome good stick to your ribs food takes some effort like granola healthy eating yes ,you have to be to this , not as good as it is
if you follow the cooking directions in my opinion you have paste cut the cooking time from minutes to minutes and it is much better a little chewy but that is how i like it breakfast takes more planning now since it is a longer cooking time than my old brand but good taste and worth it ,good with cooking , not as good as it is
we were introduced to mccann oatmeal a few years ago by close friends we were able to find it locally in a few stores near where we live however the these few stores gradually became fewer until the product was no longer available to us this left us with the internet as the only option for obtaining this product hopefully this will not fade away br br ,hard to find , great product
very satisfied with this product excellent flavor and texture for those looking for good breakfast choice ,excellent oatmeal , great product
delighted with my first ever irish oats steel cut as a diabetic this should help me with my blood sugar natural carb with a slow release br br cook up a batch in the slow cooker and use left overs microwave for a couple of days great will be purchasing more br br thanks mccann and amazon ,oatmeal another choice , great product

amazon treats products terribly i have not ordered from amazon in a long time not since they sent me expired which i tossed i thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try what a mistake never again customer service at amazon leaves much to be desired as well if you get someone they will probably speak broken english and be very hard to understand then they will not understand the problem you will have to ask for a supervisor who you hope will speak better english be prepared to wait a long time for a supervisor and you may be several times before actually getting through to a supervisor the supervisor will ask for every piece of imaginable not short of your before saying well what do you want me to do uh you are customer service service the customer amazon has lost my business forever ,good product terrible packaging by amazon , i like them

about ten years ago my wife and i stayed at a small resort near costa rica was on every table in the restaurant we were quickly hooked goes great with eggs beans rice tortillas pork fish etc it is really tasty and nothing taco sauce or steak sauce we are on our second case now give it a try ,an excellent unique sauce , best popcorn ever
i stopped at a small restaurant and ended up eating what is the typical dish rice with some vegetables mixed in also some chicken the chicken and veggies are chopped up into small pieces and all of it is cooked in a pan and served warm it is really good but what really makes it is the salsa which used to be on every table in costa rico now you may have to ask for it as it is really popular this salsa is great on chicken rice dishes just about anything i always made a point of bring a bottle or two home with me as it was not possible to purchase anywhere in america br br trust me try some of this stuff you will not regret it also it is not what i would consider a hot sauce sure it has a little heat but very mild ,the best you will ever taste , best hot sauce i have ever had

that i should not worry about it i am so suprised that this got passed inspection at a baby food manufacturer why would a company take the risk of bad when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety br br we also recently opened other jars in this flat after my son refused to eat them and realized that they were rotten of them were completely solid and at the top we a toothpick down to the bottom of the jar and it was dry throughout shortly after eating his last dinner of this box my son started vomiting and refused to eat we have contacted the usda about this if this happens to you please same your jars so you can give them the information they need it may prevent other babies from getting sick br i ll never buy anything from earth best again ,food health , great food
yes i read the other reviews and given the review dates and my other experiences with earth best i was not too concerned that the problems mentioned would still be an issue and they were not br br we have tried almost all of the gourmet line of earth best and these are great for adding protein to your little one lo diet google the earth best website for complete nutrition info most nd stage food have between and grams of protein a serving this one has grams of protein and only grams of sugars our lo likes the taste and we like the and nutrition profile recommended ,glad i gave this a try good product good nutrition other reviews are , great product
i do not think it is eb i think it is amazon i buy eb from babies r us target and whole foods and have not had any problems it is only the shipments from amazon that come moldy ,do not buy at amazon , not as good as it is
organic and loaded with calories fat and protein this the only baby food with meat that my picky little one will happily eat i have found that very few groceries carry this near my home and i live in seattle and so i have to ordering it by the case from amazon the free day shipping rocks ,the best for picky babies , great for
the other pack contained several broken jars and was leaking it smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second pack br i noticed that the shipping box holding the two packs had air filled padding on only the top side of the box which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side br i do not know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery but either way i was afraid to use the unbroken jars too because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too br for more durable items i still order from amazon but i canceled my subscription of the earth best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where i can check them first ,some broken jars , not as good as it is
i also ordered a flat of food they were on sale that contained the turkey and wild rice dinner one of them was also improperly sealed the lid popped we were lucky because i just happened to check that one now i am so that i check all of them several times i called earth best and they assured me that they have not had this problem before and that i should not worry about it i am so suprised that this got passed inspection at a baby food manufacturer why would a company take the risk of bad when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety ,was , great product
we had the same issue with this product half the flat was improperly sealed and resulted in an expired food issue but you can spot the jars because they have dried up turned solid resulting in a different sound when also when opened these bad jars are up in the middle and have a rotten smell it may be that the product was frozen in shipping and the caused the seal to break i have requested a refund from amazon br br our baby did love this meal though it was like thanksgiving dinner the ones that were still edible were delicious and are one of his favorite foods ,delicious product poor quality control , great product
this jar of baby food has grams of fat and calories thats triple the fat and double the calories of most baby food i highly recommend for babies needing to put on some lbs as well as picky eaters i have to offer my son a variety of foods each meal cheese chunks of meat etc b c he turns up his nose at so much and i cannot just say well too bad b c he needs the calories but this is one of the foods he rarely turns down i highly recommend ,great for the little , my dog loves these
amount is of their daily needs i have been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult br br i recommend this particular one chicken mango risotto because i think babies will tend to like it as mine did br br these cases are being delivered to my home constantly different varieties of earth best on occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars over time i figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars i report it and can get for the broken ones only of course it is messy when a jar is broken but i do not have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price ,had no problem they like this one a lot , not as good as i like
the other reviews are very outdated old we never had any issues with the quality of this product my daughter loved it i loved the fact that she was getting good protein most of the other earth best baby foods have carrot squash sweet potatoes which is fine however my daughter was turning orange from so many orange veggies i liked that this one had no orange veggies in the ingredient list slightly more expensive than other meals which i think is due to the fact it has a lot of meat in it ,great baby food , great product
my daughter thinks this tastes nasty and i agree she is sensitive to carrot so i was looking for a food for travel that delivers protein but does not contain carrot though she eats homemade turkey and peas all the time she would not even take a full bite of this i tasted a little bit and i can see why ,nasty , great product
if baby likes that is what matters happy baby happy mommy only thing is the color of food that stain anything but oh well just washed right the way ,baby loves the beef , great product
i have read other reviewers comment on the calorie content of this flavor and it must be high because when i was trying to wash the dish i served it in in was quite oily also it has a bit of a grainy texture and i think my month old son finds the spinach a little difficult to digest ,and a little but thick , not as good as it is
my mo old all things fruit related we think it is too sweet for her yet she likes this one just fine i am perplexed that so many other reviewers say their baby hates it although i must admit i have not tasted it myself for us it is a tasty way to get her to eat a little more fruit every day ,even a fruit likes it , not as good as it is
i purchased this product from b r us when it was on sale and my son seems to like it i was scared of previous post of mold and i always double check the food before i stir and serve he seems to like it but i recommend the chicken sweet potato dinner ,son seems to like it , great product
are not fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to hunger br br i d love to ask who came up with the magical oz for all stage baby food jars and packets though my son takes more like oz of my home prepared meals which are much fuller so i have had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume and it does seem really quite runny and out with water so i add a teaspoon or of rice cereal to thicken it up a little before long i am sure he will just be on full oz jars when i give him this br br all that said i will it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food and i have no problem giving it to my son once in a while i do recommend ,small jars and a little runny like most baby foods , great product
the earth best line is heavy on the protein and as far as i know adequate protein is important for babies and they need like the rest of us good iron levels br br the beef and spinach contains grams per serving you can check your cans but most of the other we use the protein is grams our daughter likes it it is also the least expensive of the gourmet line and this is not something i could find in local stores recommended ,twice the protein of other earth best and baby food in , great product
i was looking for another dinner to try and decided to spend the extra money on this one i thought my son loves chicken and mangos so why not this he is not a fan he will suffer through half a jar but will not finish a whole one i guess it was a little too exotic for his month old taste buds we will keep trying br br he loves loves loves the beef and spinach and will almost cry when the jar is gone ,not a fan , not as good as it is
this was not a hit it is bitter like maybe the carrots were not sweet and or not peeled and the main ingredient is carrots amazon should include the ingredients for all items quality control seems to be an issue this is the second gourmet meal flavor with this issue i had never had a bad experience with the eb products before very disappointing ,bitter and , not as good as it is
my girls seem to like this food they have only ever shown an to green beans but it is so messy it is apparently tomato based and it gets everywhere where we usually just wipe their faces gently you really have to clean them it simply turns their skin orange and the bowls and spoon end up crazy oily even after ,messy messy messy , great product
my picky eater loves this flavor each jar is calories grams of fat so this loves this flavor as well i am ordering more because it is the one flavor besides green beans that i know my son will eat ,son loves this flavor , great for
this is a terrific baby food it has beef and spinach and tastes great it was the first meat baby food my son would eat i tasted it myself and it is quite good ,excellent nutrition and great taste , great food
my baby is months and i purchased the gourmet meals pack she really liked this one best out of all of them ,baby really likes this one , great product
my daughter loves this she is picky so she does not always eat as many healthy foods as she should this flavor gives her the vegetables and protein that she needs it is a little bit than other stage foods but still very usable for babies over months ,great taste nutritious and organic all in one , great product
i have never had a problem with anything from amazon i have ordered about cases of earth best baby food this is the most tasty and nutritious variety they offer grams of protein and iron i have it on my subscribe and save he cannot get enough of this he eats it everyday ,my son loves these , great for
earth best is supposed to be one of the best baby foods but apparently my son does not have a palate for their food maybe he did not like the texture of this stuff it looks gritty he normally eats anything but was very sluggish with this food turning his head after a couple of bites ,does not look and baby would not eat it , great popcorn
it was bad before we open them i saw them when we got i did open it had some spot green color i did not know what it was i was very upset do not buy this product ,it gone bad before we open , not as good as it is
the other pack contained several broken jars and was leaking it smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second pack br i noticed that the shipping box holding the two packs had air filled padding on only the top side of the box which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side br i do not know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery but either way i was afraid to use the unbroken jars too because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too br for more durable items i still order from amazon but i canceled my subscription of the earth best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where i can check them first ,some broken jars , not as good as it is

i bought these for my wife for her birthday she loves chocolate and its a staple gift i give her well this year i got her these she only ate one and put them away very strange later i caught her putting them in the garbage when i tried one i quickly realized why they taste like they have no sugar in them and leave an aftertaste that reminded me of badly burnt toast i had to brush my teeth to get the taste out we had a good laugh about it fortunately i also gave her a which she really did love so they did not ruin her birthday dollars wasted ,terrible cheap chocolates for , good for you
i am not much of a chocolate and peanut butter person but these chocolates are the perfect combination of both the different flavors have definitely made me a fan ,love these chocolates , good but not great

i purchased this coffee to make iced coffee drinks it has very little coffee taste and the dark chocolate taste is more chemical than chocolate similar to the taste of flavoring used in baking br br i will not be purchasing this coffee again my suggestion to those considering a purchase buy something else ,taste coffee , not good
i never drank coffee in my life received a gift of ghiradelli chocolate flavored coffee for christmas searched on line and found this dark chocolate decadence it is the absolute best have it on bi monthly subscription order now with amazon if you are a fan of dark chocolate this is a wonderful coffee very smooth with just a hint a dark chocolate in the background delicious sweetened with honey and milk also divine with almond milk or vanilla soy milk coffee masters make wonderful coffee ,wonderful coffee with hint of dark chocolate , best coffee ever
i love that i can get both flavors in one container and at the store around where i am at they go for about a buck sometimes more so this is definitely a good deal and even cheaper when you subscribe and save ,great value , great taste
same stable and good quality of when i got the good deal from amazon com the price is even better than those available in local asian store which is really rare ,good deal , good
i bought these for my son th birthday party favor goodie bag it is hard to put together a goodie bag for year old boys but this is something that everyone likes ,great party , great taste
it is exactly what i wanted it is yummy make sure you eat your chocolate dip before the strawberry because you will not like it the other way around it is perfect ,delicious , not as good as it is
this mix is easy to prepare and very tasty the only prep work consists of cutting up a zucchini which takes less than a minute the seasoning is excellent very flavorful but not too spicy sometimes low salt mixes are spiced up with a lot of pepper but not this one excellent for vegetarians ,highly recommended , great product
i have a one one coffee pod machine and have ordered pods online before these looked good and sounded like high quality coffee albeit a little pricey for pods this was the worst cup of coffee i have ever tasted it left a bitter taste in my mouth that for hours yuck do not be fooled by the fancy name and packaging it tastes like fuel fortunately amazon refunded my money when i explained how bad it was throwing the whole box away ,worst cup of coffee i have ever tasted , not as good as i have
several of the seller listings indicate kona blend but the delivered product does not have this package br as a long time kona coffee drinker the contents are more of or less kona coffee have ordered twice and completely disappointed ,kona coffee blend , great coffee
my dog loves this flavor quality of cookie overall is very good this particular smell drives him crazy on amazon i get much than in a store ,good , my dog loves them
dogs love them and they are made the best way they are about cheaper that the pet stores and no tax ,best ever , my dog loves these
old mother treats are the best and at a reasonable price their treats come in a lot of different sizes and flavors they offer a variety of products that all dogs will love my three black labs love the peanut butter and ,best treats ever , my dog loves these
received the shipment promptly but to my dismay it did not contain the mini treats i had ordered but small which were not that small i have very small dogs and i really wanted the minis i contacted the seller petco and after several days they responded that i could return them but if i reordered minis they would still send the small because amazon had the item numbers wrong and they do not have minis they said the thing would be to return them for credit this did not seem so i am breaking each one into small pieces which is very inconvenient ,my dogs love the taste , my dog loves them
we live an hour away from any stores that would carry this product so it is easier and cheaper than making the trip ,it is all about the , great product
it definitely smells like dark chocolate but the taste is just average i cannot say i taste the dark chocolate decadence and it is not that strong but usually i like stronger tasting coffee ,smells good , not as good as it
coffee instead of the chocolate coffee i used to regularly enjoy but could not find on amazon brothers gourmet coffee chocolate swirl the coffee masters dark chocolate decadence bean is darker and richer than the brothers bean the brothers bean coffee is milder more like swiss chocolate br br i still might prefer the medium bean brothers blend over this coffee even though it is a medium bean and not a dark bean as the flavor profile tastes more like real chocolate br br update i am now seeking out coffees that are fair trade or direct trade or advertise ethical practices those that ignore the of the and show no in the process of the coffee from field to table i do not buy any longer so this brand is no longer one that i will purchase plus they in activities that are not sound i suggest starting with ,good coffee with some , not my favorite
sounds corny but oh so true the aroma is pungent with the savory smell of coffee and the sweetness of chocolate the chocolate flavor is rich yet delicate so it does not overwhelm i purchased four bags of the ground coffee first for my daughter she i taste it even tho i do not like flavored coffee or dark chocolate i enjoyed it so much i took back a bag and purchased bags of the whole beans to grind when needed for that added freshness while i will not drink flavored coffee all the time i feel it is a treat to start or end my day with a cup of this delicious coffee my daughter also enjoys this coffee cold ,a treat for all the , not as good as i have
we like to mix this with regular coffee because it is so strong and rich by itself that it makes it go further and is not too overpowering ,very rich and chocolate flavor , great coffee
another great hit from coffee masters this one has a rich dark chocolate flavor that is not too intense but just right the coffee is bodied and very smooth i will definitely order more from amazon ,rich and , great coffee
i have really fallen for flavored coffees and i consider these to be some of the best so much so that i am on the regular shipment list now i am sure i drink too much of this but i love the flavors try it i am sure you will like it ,a real fan , great taste
this like yummy homemade hot cocoa with the benefit of being a delicious cup of coffee too this is a great deal get it while it lasts good to the last drop you could say br enjoy ,d e i c i o u , great taste
you have to put a lot of sugar in this to make it taste good the coffee just by itself kind if has a stinky smell like a diaper or a poo poo puppy in a cup next time i am going for raspberry flavored coffee cause the chocolate is like poop yuck ,this is not that great , not as good as it is
my female bob cat is extremely finicky about her canned food she will touch nothing but instinct rabbit formula and licks her plate clean each morning the instinct brand is nothing but the best whether it is a canned formula or dry ,the down favorite canned food , cat grass
above her normal weight and has a nice chubby belly my cat suffered daily for long years during this whole process before i found this and the other two mentioned products the aloe vera juice on its own did not seem to completely do the trick so i think its the combination of the three things that is really effective i only hope that no permanent damage has already been done but now i have my cat back and do not have to suffer through losing a great wife and a great cat if you have a cat with severe stomach issues you owe it to yourself and your cat to try this along with the aloe vera and br br a href http www amazon com gp product b tablets a br br a href http www amazon com gp product b ta aloe vera fl oz liquid a ,worked great for my cat , cat cat cat food
i was at my end with hypoallergenic foods for my cat with ibd this one is one he will finally eat and even ask for nothing is more than trying to get a sick cat to eat and putting expensive prescription food down to have him sniff walk away and cry for food i was so relieved when i found this my cat is now i they continue to make it for years to come ,food that my cat will actually eat , cat cat cat food
we tried all flavors for our cats and the rabbit was the apparent favorite for all of them took a recommendation from org for this food as it is closest to the diet that a cat would naturally eat coats are softer and glossy energy levels seem to be up quite pleased with the results so far ,pleased with this , my cat loves it
a few years ago my cat was diagnosed with food allergies that previously had led to ibd and then pancreatitis we went through just about every limited ingredient food to find one he would eat consistently he finally settled on nature variety instinct lamb and rabbit he will eat every time and all the time duck and venison he will also eat just not always br br he still suffers from ibd and will have pancreatitis flare ups if given chicken but his coat is soft and shiny he is active at yrs old and he rarely throws up i could not survive he could not survive without this food br br i m glad the company finally started to make oz cans mr picky does not does not like leftovers it does not hurt as much to toss out oz as it does oz ,even loves it , my cat loves it
balance limited ingredients venison with peas and the duck with peas neither of those compare to this brand and my cats to that as well as i do the texture is so much better and she loves these the most i have gotten her the rabbit duck and venison and she eats them all with more relish that either evo or natural balance i do have to say that of those lesser brands the natural balance venison does have a nice texture and not as pasty as the duck with peas was not as crazy about it though although she did eat it all but not with the same excitement as the instinct brand when you are having a problem with a cat that can not or will not eat something when you find something she will it is worth it is weight in gold this brand is a keeper ,expensive but worth it , cat cats
since one of the many of canned food is that it helps to keep the cat hydrated they have a low thirst drive and are built to take in much of their fluids with their food i was a bit disappointed and surprised the first time i what looked like a can full of meat too far to the side and ended up with watery cat food juice on my hand and the kitchen floor but this was also solved by mixing it with a chicken in gravy food br br those complaints are not enough to keep me from buying this food though it is still a great cat food with a hard to find protein source and a good ingredient list it is a bit expensive for me to use as a main food but a can or two a week gives just the right amount of variety ,great cat food , cat food
one of my cats developed a food allergy and was throwing up anything he ate there are many types of food that the vet recommended trying duck venison etc but he refused to eat any of those br br then we found this food and all is good again br br thank goodness there is something he will to eat that will not his food allergies ,finally a food my cat will eat that will not make sick , cat cat food
the vet recommended rabbit based food for my cat and that is difficult to find she seems to be allergic to chicken and the regular cat food menu unfortunately she is not crazy about this food but that is just because she is a spoiled cat ,cat food , my cat loves it
simple wheat pale malt light ale fermented at about give or take grain to bottle in a week i was not too concerned with or but that is just me cracked on the other day just to get a taste extremely clean you can taste every single grain of the malt i did not it much maybe tops with very nice or beer br br blow off tube is next project is a american wheat blew out the i had gallons in a gallon and it wanted enough space for gallons very br br if you want an absolutely crisp clean yeast that produces very lager like beers and can tolerate down to about this is it seems to really malt very nice yeast but i like a little yeast profile so i do not know if i am in love with it just impressed at how clean it is ,super clean crisp as close to from an as it gets , great product
is lead in your if you have been through it then you understand what i am talking about br br i can say with honesty that it has given me way more energy and it has helped with that heavy feeling can i guarantee it will work no my aunt and mom tried a couple just one time and they did not notice any difference but it has sure worked for me taking it daily what i can tell you is that you should at least try it if it does not help just do not buy it again but it is sure worth a try because it might help you as much as it has me i will take this supplement for the rest of my life as far as i am concerned that is how much it has helped br br i hope it works for you too ,energy , not as good as it is

as a gum addict i was looking for a natural alternative to the artificial flavor artificial sweetener varieties this gum is great now the flavor comes from real peppermint so it is not going to last as long as the fake stuff nor it will be as mind intense as some of the new super flavored gums but if that is ok with you and you would like to chew something that does not put weird chemicals into your body this is for you it is expensive sadly but what can you expect buying it in bulk here helps ,is great , not as good as it is
i like to chew gum and i also like my teeth i am also allergic to most artifical sweetners and it is getting more and more difficult to find sugar free gums that do not contain aspartame this is why i purchased this product in the first place i like the flavor and it lasts quite a long time the packets are the perfect size to fit in your pocket or purse i always have some on hand at work especially for after lunch i will certainly be buying more ,great gum , great product
very tasty gum and the xylitol is wonderful my youngest daughter dentist that she chew xylitol gum to times each day to help prevent her baby teeth had a in every tooth along with three her adult teeth seem to be much more and i believe the gum is helping prevent the ,great gum , great product
by diabetics and prevents tooth and has some other health benefits research it xylichew is the only brand i have found that i can say is not produced in china or sourced from materials produced in china xylichew is produced in finland given china contaminated products record the past few years i would trust a product from finland over china any day the gum itself has a nice peppermint flavor that does not last too long that is okay by me as i generally just chew this gum after a meal for dental health it is pretty expensive but you can get free shipping and a discount through amazon subscribe save program xylichew comes in other flavors but the last time i checked peppermint is the only one available through the subscribe save program br important note keep any products with xylitol away from dogs it is toxic to them ,good sugar free gum with quality ingredients and it is not made in china , not as good as it is
have had this gum from other sources and always liked it this particular shipment seems to have much less peppermint flavor than before could be it is older gum there is no expiration date on it or they are making it with less peppermint now otherwise i received this order very quickly ,gum , not as good as it is
this is an excellent sugar free gum for those who do not want or many commercial gums that are advertised as containing xylitol also contain unnatural chemical sweeteners the flavor and soft texture lasts very well in the peppermint and fruit flavors another family member really enjoys the licorice one the chocolate has a disappointing flavor and the cinnamon which to me tastes like almond at first quickly gets hard and loses flavor have not tried spearmint while the serving size is listed as pieces i find is exactly the right amount for my mouth ,good gum , delicious
i am into health i do not use any artificial sweeteners or refined sugars in any form xylichew was a great find because its ingredient list is actually safe this is rare for a gum the gum has a great taste it has the right amount of sweetness and the pieces are a good size i take half a piece at a time while my wife prefers a whole piece if you are looking for a safe gum this is the one and amazon has such a sweet deal on it do not pass it up ,best gum ever , not as good as it is
the advertised regular price of is ridiculous hour energy drinks are widely available for each do not buy from sellers who prices and charge ridiculous amounts you can get a case of for right here on amazon ,price , the best
also gives all this energy in ounces instead of having to drink a large soda can worth of drink the taste was not fantastic but it could have been much worst and only takes a good to get it all down br br i ve been looking for a product like this to get me going in the mornings and this seems to fit the bill my only problem with this is that it is a bit on the pricey side today i am also trying out one that is similar called a ounce energy shot that claims all the same benefits that this promises but at a much lower price i will do a review on that sometime soon in the future if i feel just as awake and alert as i do with hour energy then i will use it instead otherwise chaser has a new steady customer ,gave me a boost when i needed it , not as good as it is
although the taste leaves something to be desired hour energy worked very well i drank one halfway through my and up enough to go out and wash the my arms hurt later that night but the product itself worked for me ,great energy boost without getting , great product
this is a great price but every time i have bought these through amazon the bottles frequently have dark stuff on the of the bottle when you open it i have never seen this when buying them from the local so i worry that these are either old or maybe not authentic br br can t say for sure of course they do have the desired effect so i am not complaining too much it is kind of gross sometimes though ,good price not clean , good but not great
well u get the energy u really want for the hours and it really u a bit but that u will be calm again and need to rest not bad great product ,great product , great product
the energy drink is a great product the shipping price is crazy tho i paid more for the shipping then both products together so not a great deal ,energy drink , the best
i recently gave up my major year diet coke addiction i did it for a number of reasons i typically wake very early to hit the gym before work needed something to help me wake up at am this product is great no over as it only has the caffeine equivalent of cup of it is also sugar free and has net carbs i do feel the energy quickly it lasts the hours it claims the berry flavor is pleasant but tart so i drink some water as a chaser no pun intended i drink water the rest of the day only use in the morning unless i have a late meeting scheduled ,safe and effective , not as good as it is

i sampled this cake as offered from month ago and fell in love it is extremely moist and is most delicious when sliced thin to a cup of coffee the ingredients are perfectly blended as no one taste is overpowering but you are able to taste each individual ingredient if you are looking for a great coffee or tea please give this cake a try ,in cake , delicious
this is the most delicious cake in the world if you like almond tarts that kind of taste you will be in love with this cake normally i think packaged cake is awful by the way this one is amazing ,so this is how i got fat , delicious
first the ingredients list is wrong they are almonds not cashews i do not have a recent bag just ordered but i have seen some with tapioca syrup and some with rice syrup listed in the ingredients my year old son has tons of foods he needs to avoid so these are important to us luckily he has been able to eat these and loves them br br the pieces in the bag vary in size the most typical is about long by wide there will be some loose crumbs in the bottom too it looks like they make them in a big pan and then cut them down i would compare them to bite size or bite sized granola bars it is just the right amount of sweetness added i love that these have a nice protein boost when i need to grab something and go ,just the right size for a yummy crunchy snack , not as good as i be
i spent some time searching for an alcohol free rum flavor to make and has produced the best flavor thus far which tastes outstanding it blows away the competitors that i have tried baking with it has not yet been attempted but i imagine there would be similar results the price is quite reasonable for a oz bottle although it is much more so if multiple bottles are ordered save on shipping it has natural and artificial ingredients i would prefer it to be all natural but that is a price i am willing to pay for the flavor i this will remain my alcohol free rum flavor of choice ,great free flavor in , great product
i bought this bag and found it cheaper at smart and final it was also old and and white this was terrible i bought it to put in the candy canisters i give to co workers so i did not find out it was old till a co worker informed me i was so embarrassed do not buy this candy it all ended up in the trash very disappointed ,candy look liked it was open it is old do not buy , not as good as it is
this candy was obviously old each chocolate was the were not crispy and the chocolate was not right butter cups and nasty the nuts are horrible their candy off of the shelves in the stores when it is getting old seller must have bought it up sold it here last year or the year before it has to be at least or more years old do not buy chocolate from values it is not good for you br br i m sure that if the candy were fresh that it would have been just fine i have re ordered from a different vendor and will let you know if theirs is fresh as it should be or not ,ordered from yuck , not as good as it is
sealed and are ready for winter when things get rough as around here it is hard to get organics so when i do i get all that i can like i just got up at the farmers market this late fall and then i either freeze them or can them and even them br so i will keep you up to date but i need to try and get some organic fruits and that is hard to get again around here br well catch ya later as i never say goodbye just get this wonderful organic fruit nut and seed mix it has no preservatives and is delicious and affordable and if i can get it you can too just remember to soak the nuts and seeds because nature puts some protective coating on it and they need to break down this to be edible and fit for human consumption ,raw organics going back to , fantastic
put two tablespoons in a large cup of fresh coffee and you have a great coffee mocha i have recently tried several others that have been recommended and got great customer reviews online none are as good as this one ,it is the best for coffee , good coffee

this is the best hot chocolate next to cadbury bought in europe our yr old would never drink her chocolate milk until we switched to this unfortunately we do not have a steady supply of cadbury it is great ,great hot chocolate , great hot cocoa
i usually buy this from starbucks but after buying this item on sale i will be making my coffee at home i am not a heavy coffee drinker but sometimes when i have to study i need a quick pick me up and this will do it i love all their product sometimes i add a little cinnamon grade aa and it really gives it a boost i would definitely buy this product again and i think it is a good price i saw it for a lot more in the store ,my to , not as good as it is
we appreciate the short list of ingredients on the ghiradelli hot chocolate mixes the chocolate mocha flavor is rich and chocolatey with out being overpowered by the coffee this is one of our favorite cold weather drinks ,rich beverage mix , great hot cocoa
found this product discounted at a good price at net for about br br first time drinking this stuff since i bought it i was blown away at how awesome it taste this was my first time trying something other than the nestle brand cocoa other than the few times i ordered cocoa at a cafe br br has a nice blend of cocoa and does not taste too sweet like what i am used to with nestle br br definitely giving this a thumbs up ,good stuff , not as good as it is
hot choc powder stirring to fully mix now add oz brothers vs brandy garnish with whipped cream or a small of vanilla ice cream and serve br notes not to be a brand but vs not the more expensive is the only brandy i have found to really have the right profile for this recipe exact for all ingredients should ultimately be to your own taste non fat and milk are not recommended the brandy should contribute its flavor but not be so strong as to have an obvious alcoholic note i have for many years used a mocha hazelnut ratio but lately the mocha product has not seemed as intense so i have adjusted you will know it is right when the mocha hazelnut brandy flavors are in such balance that none is too dominant the result will be a new experience greater than the sum of its parts ,recipe hot for , not bad
i did not expect this hot chocolate to be quite as sweet as i found it to be it also has more calories than previous ghiradelli similar hot chocolate br it has a rich taste and if i were not concerned with weight i would overlook the higher calories ,hot chocolate rich and sweet , not as good as it is
while you would expect ghiradelli to make good chocolate the flavor of this mocha cocoa is precisely that of great darker chocolate flavor using just enough coffee flavor to the cocoa without it a smooth delicious start or finish to your day even a warm afternoon pick me up on those days ,the chocolate of , good coffee
premium ghiradelli chocolate mixed with just a hit of coffee makes this a great drink i have gotten to where i add a heaping spoonful to my starbucks coffee every morning it gives it an extra coffee flavor and the chocolate for ghiradelli far the mocha chocolate you get at most barista stands ,this stuff is the greatest , great coffee
i use this product with my home brewed espresso and milk to make a mocha latte it is terrific i ordered on the auto ship plan through amazon and save about a per can over buying it locally plus i get the added benefit of having it delivered to my door instead of having to drive to a specialty shop to get it great product and great service ,great for a hot , great product
i love this hot chocolate in my opinion it is the best on the market it has a nice grown up flavor of chocolate and coffee ,love it , great hot chocolate
i do not know what all the positive reviewers here are raving about i tried premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable and not a very chocolatey taste either the directions given for one serving are tbsp of the powder to oz of milk did they meant tsp using their directions would yield a total of cups of hot cocoa not very economical for a product with so much sugar i had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed ,way too sweet and do not make , not as good as it is
very bitter i could not taste the coffee at all it basically tastes like baking cocoa no sweetness no richness not coffee i bought the pack though so i have begun mixing it half and half with swiss miss in the can and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after i have made a cup even making it with whole milk could not make this yummy by itself if you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee shop elsewhere ,not my cup of cocoa , not as good as i be
i am now retired and started drinking it every day i was afraid that i would get tired of it drinking it every day instead of just as a treat well that did not happen at all i am now what i would call addicted to it i have it every morning with my toast and my on tv i recently went to my mother place for several days and truly missed my favorite morning drink i could not wait to have it the morning after i got home next time i am going to be gone for several days i will make sure i take a canister with me i love that i have found this product on amazon and even that i have to opportunity to have it via automatic shipment i started having trouble finding it in the stores we shop so the automatic shipment it great ,chocolate lovers drink , great product
love this hot chocolate made with skim milk for a healthier delicious hot drink creamy and tasty will never go back to supermarket hot chocolates ,delicious , great hot chocolate
this is absolutely the best hot chocolate out there it is not too sweet so more for adults than for kids easy to make just add milk no intense mixing required dissolves easily ,the best hot cocoa , great hot cocoa
okay so let me my review by saying that i do not drink hot chocolate that often and i am from america and do not think i have ever had hot chocolate while traveling in europe but my husband is a british who grew up in india with summers in england and he has searched high and low for a chocolate drink that would remind him of those from his childhood we found it in this drink and he wont drink any other chocolate drink now not even the other kinds that are in my pantry that i bought for him to try and after cup he turned his nose up at them men ,tastes like hot chocolate , not as good as it is
having liked the various types of ghirardelli chocolate and premium hot cocoa i decided to try some ghirardelli chocolate premium hot cocoa mix chocolate mocha after trying several cups of this i started to wonder what happened to the ghirardelli chocolate as myself i thought it was overpowered with the coffee taste not my cup of hot cocoa ,where is the chocolate taste , great taste
i have been a fan of ghirardelli triple chocolate brownie mix for a long time and i also like ghirardelli chocolate candy so when i came across this chocolate mocha hot cocoa mix i wanted to give it a try cause i love cocoa and coffee i am glad i bought it because this stuff is delicious i love the combination of chocolate and coffee the coffee in it is very subtle and definitely not overpowering it is rich very flavorful and bold and as others have pointed out this is the best mix you can buy i am very impressed ,simply delicious , great taste
great deal and great transaction finally an affordable way to indulge my chocolate craving will definitely buy this again ,chocolate premium hot cocoa mix chocolate ounce pack of , great product
ghiradelli might not make the best chocolate in the world but their chocolate mix is my personal favorite it is rich and mixes easily without the residue in the bottom of the cup that lesser brands suffer from the mocha flavor is very good with a strong coffee flavor that does not overpower the chocolate this is simply great hot chocolate and well worth getting if you enjoy mocha it also mixes very well in milk shakes ,coffee chocolate , best i have ever had
i made this for my year old grandson grandma this is the best hot chocolate i have ever had in my whole life you can guess what he got for christmas it really has a wonderful flavor top it off with whipped cream ,has it again , great hot cocoa
i love hot cocoa and hot chocolate and have tried many different brands br br ghiradelli is by far the worst that i have ever tasted i honestly do not have any idea how they ever became famous for their hot cocoa br br this cocoa has an awful stale taste and you can tell that it is made of cheap ingredients br br it even tastes worse than the much lower cost brands like swiss miss and nestle br br if you want a real hot chocolate look up it is thick and rich not processed garbage like ghiradelli ,this cocoa no stars , not as good as it is
the chocolate mocha flavor of this hot cocoa is really nice it is different from the usual hot cocoa since it has a hint of coffee the quality is definitely there i find it to be better then the godiva brand mixes extremely easily there is no residue and works with milk or even water mixed with half and half i must say that it is a bit much of the same flavor i would have rather different flavors since the containers are big worth it though a ,tastes good but it is a lot of one flavor , not as good as it is
best mix on the market for making cafe mocha lattes and we have tried them all ,delicious , great stuff
the best hot chocolate by far not so easily available in my area br love the mocha the double chocolate ,simply the , great hot cocoa
easy to use do not abuse a href http www amazon com gp product b h nu ghirardelli chocolate premium hot cocoa mix double chocolate ounce tins pack of a great taste it makes you to feel good ,sweet from hard work on a cold day , not as good as it is
try a little sprinkle on ice cream makes a good milkshake mix it in cakes or brownies sprinkle on the cake enhance coffee drinks and get rid of that cat add texture to and pounds of pudding brown paper movie or dip your bananas in it i consume it with homemade vanilla ice cream i like the double chocolate better ,hot cocoa , great product
not really sure what i expected but since i like ghirardelli chocolate and i like hot chocolate and hot from coffee shops i thought i would like this product br br unfortunately despite following the directions and making this in milk it is not as rich and as i hoped i hate to say it but i think swiss miss mixed instant coffee tastes better than this br br that unfortunate because this is a four pack of and i am only half way through the first one ,not as rich and satisfying as i thought , not as good as it is
love the contents but two of eight containers were badly dented br br jan ,dented but good , great product
great product love making this during the fall and winter months because the smell goes through the entire house reminding me of christmas taste great too especially when warm and with cream cheese have made it for co workers who always rave about it it is easy to make up too ,quick bread , great product
i cannot tell you how many of these i made between thanksgiving and christmas fast convenient and so delicious i got rave reviews thanks ,so good , great taste
i have tried nearly all of the pillsbury quick bread mixes and this is my favorite and of course it is nearly impossible to find in a store in my area so i am really happy to find it on amazon this has a packet of actual diced apple in syrup sort of like the canned apples for pie it makes great muffins or coffee cake also you can add things to it like raisins cranberries nuts etc just super i recommend it ,of my , great product
i bought this product and when it arrived it was not organic beware the package shown in the photo is not an organic product ,not organic , not as good as
this is the perfect size for a snack bag for school minus one star because the glue for the straws also the wrapper to all of the boxes that is annoying ,perfect for snack bag , great snack

i absolutely love the peanut butter and strawberry kind bars they taste just like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,fabulous , delicious
these potato chips are probably the best chips i flavor ever have the spicy barbecue is the perfect mix of flavors i have had tons of these chips and still they never get old it fits one person per bag after a few chips you will taste the spicy part every time i see the bag my mouth just waters br br these would be perfect for you if you are getting tired of the other potato chips br br depending on the stores sometimes shipping can be expensive if that is the case most of the times you can find it at your local oriental groceries ,would be perfect for you if you are getting of the other potato chips , great chips
oh man i love this candy it is super delicious but its really not that sour i would always a giant of and spend it all on these for cents each ,delicious , delicious
our friends from germany visited with us a few weeks back and one of them adores she had them here years back and when i no longer could find a bottled mix locally i ordered it from the internet this is my first experience with master of mixes and the turned out great just as good as if i had made them from scratch a great product ,of just as good as , great product
i just love this chili it is than other no beans and the blend of seasoning is simply outstanding much more savory and less of an to the tastebuds than hormel in my opinion goes great on a hot dog a baked potato good to dip tortilla chips in and a wonderful companion to grilled cheese sandwiches or just toasted english muffins ,just great , great chips
so anyways i wished that i could find ginseng tea more easier but for the price the shipping i suppose its comes in a weird form not powder kinda like small bits of grass taste fine not sour or sweet ,its ok , not as good as it is
packed poorly in shipping and a few had the seal broken because they were rolling around in the box ,good stuff but , great product

bull dog has become a flavorful addition to my kitchen i have used it in everything marinades rice stir fries vegetables etc i have also used it by itself or as a base to dipping sauces it also adds a nice component to homemade bbq sauce if i had to compare it to something it would be steak sauce everytime i want to change a dish up a bit i use i have bought mine from somewhere else and did not know it came in larger sizes the offering here is almost double the size but it is also almost triple the price however if the place i buy it from were to stop i would buy it here without fail i just wish they had the less salt version ,a new , great product
my dogs loved these they were cheap too only problem is they are oily to the touch given they outside is great ,to the touch , my dog loves these
arrowhead mills organic savory herb stuffing has a very nice blend of herbs for a flavor that compliments chicken and turkey i especially appreciate the fact that there are no used in this stuffing so i and my family can enjoy it without worry the stuffing is very easy to prepare but really adds to the meal we use it all year long why wait for a holiday to enjoy good food ,tasty and healthy , great product
my daughter loved the little tin that came with her tea set so much that i got her a of this for christmas i think it will end up being a regular gift as we all love it so much it really is delicious and with green tea being so good for you we drink it all the time all the products i have tried from have been wonderful ,delicious tea , great tea
i am hooked on it it is just wonderful highly recommended for taste and flavor and price i have tried different teas from different restaurants and tea houses but i just love this one for home i use it nearly every day will be trying more of these teas in the future ,love this tea , great tea
i normally hate hate hate citrus anything in my tea i always thought it tasted the way lemon dish soap smells i received this tea in a sampler and wow i cannot get enough of it it is the first citrus flavored tea i have ever liked in my life it smells really good sorta like and i did not even need to put any sugar or honey in it to enjoy it ,wow , delicious
had spoiled in transit and considered returning the remaining bottles but then i noticed the very bottom line on the product label enriched with organic lemon juice it was too much trouble to return and while i do not totally enjoy the tartness that the lemon juice adds it is at least still pure and organic and healthy br br i would not have ordered the product had i known that it was not just carrot juice but carrot juice with organic lemon juice added to it perhaps this is why the price is so very right but i feel br br it takes some getting used to if you are seeking the taste of carrot juice before you order this item i would suggest you buy a small bottle of carrot juice and squeeze some lemon juice into it to the effect of having lemon juice flavored carrot juice ,this product is with lemon juice , it is the
it is hard to find carrot juice in stores so i gave it a try and ordered some juice from this seller via amazon even so i felt kind of doing so br well i will do it again my six bottles of juice were shipped super fast packaging was very good the juice itself is excellent it is actually that rich in taste that i mix it half with water or apple juice that way the already reasonable price becomes even better br i am really glad i gave it a try drinking a of carrot juice a day works wonders on my skin ,excellent juice , not as good as it is
my recommendation get a and make your own or try odwalla the taste was bitter and the smell was strange and foul the label says enriched with organic lemon juice and that is not pure carrot juice in my book maybe it was the lemon i tasted i do not know i had about three sips and could not stomach it ,pure is better , not as good as it is
this carrot juice is the best i have tried so many other brands and this is the tastiest we love the carrot orange and the super veggie too it is healthy and great tasting can t get better then that ,best ever , great taste
looked at the ingredients but i figured that the makers would only add it if it did not change the taste that much well all i have to say is i taste no of carrots at all it tasted more like drinking a bad v or something then after sipping a couple of ounces i now have an acid reflux feeling in my throat and chest i drink water with lemon pretty often and never have that happen so now i am wondering exactly how much lemon juice is in here br br if you want carrot juice this is not for you i do not even think they should call it that br br i do not normally do it but i am seriously considering taking this back to the supermarket i also think i should write a letter to the company because it is just that ridiculously bad ,juice really , a great product
i tried this carrot juice for the first time today and regret buying it i took my first sip and actually wondered if someone had put pickle juice in the jar it was awful i have had several carrot juices and never had any as sour as this it is difficult to how this product is still produced it has lemon juice in it but apparently far far too much if you enjoy pickle juice with your carrot juice you will love this product i don t ,sour , great product
i do not know how they did it but this is by far the worst tasting carrot juice i have ever had i think it has to do with the long shelf life in i drank it in well i tried to drink it it was probably bottled in or something br br ,awful , the best
of finding the pure or at least requires no matter of fact arms length like in a grocery store aisle is close enough to be br br ok lakewood so think what you will about my criticism be it harsh or possibly even or totally wrong on the other hand i think not but i would love to be proven wrong are you game for a little challenge get three rd heck even three year olds and give them each crayons green yellow and orange now ask them to draw a picture for the label of juice which contains carrots and lemons or if your enough for a real acid test lemons and carrots all i am saying is give a chance in a world of rip and and be honest and be excellent to one another br br no hard feelings right br br aka aka b t rd ,pure from , not bad but not great
been waiting for this to be shipped for over days might be ok hard to tell unless they send it ,hard to tell , great product
they are very hard to find but whenever i do i try to stock up great flavor perfect for munching on and still pretty healthy highly recommended ,best ever , great product
i purchased this product for my goats initially i like to give a warm drink of molasses water to my does after they kid and i also give a tablespoon full to any goat that seems to be feeling poorly it seems to give them a good boost when they most need it i bought an extra bottle for the house because i have always loved a bit of molasses on my biscuits much of the molasses even that labeled blackstrap that i have been finding in recent years is bland and seems to lack flavor this molasses is quite delicious if you like molasses and is rich and flavorful it also has high iron content higher than i was finding in other brands ,excellent quality , delicious
my wife has a difficult time getting enough iron and supplements are very hard on her stomach with of the of iron in one serving of this blackstrap molasses she can very easily get the iron she needs this is not in any way hard on her stomach either it tastes very good compared to other we tried a few have a slight edge on taste but none on iron content blackstrap is an acquired taste but worth it for natural nutrients this definitely picked up her step within a very short time she gets low energy and tired when she needs iron we will definitely be buying this again ,great and decent taste , good for you
i bought this for my mother on the recommendation of my family he said my mom has iron deficiency as the name iron deficiency is due to iron without enough iron your body cannot produce enough a substance in red blood cells that them to carry oxygen as a result iron deficiency can leave you tired and short of breath the solution boost your iron intake br br one tablespoon of this tasty delight has rda of iron and it tastes pretty good too if you like the taste of black licorice i would say you will probably like the taste of this ,very high in , not as good as it is
i bought this molasses at a local grocery store and nowhere on the bottle does it state that it is i called the company and talked to a sales rep in which he stated that it was not although it does have a higher percentage of iron i am going back to ,not , not as good as it is
this stuff does not taste like black licorice or sweet in any way to me it tastes kind of like thick nasty soy sauce i cannot see how anyone could take tablespoons a week of this i barely managed to swallow the teaspoon i put in my mouth we eat very healthy and not much sugar but my tastebuds say no way to this stuff it does have of your daily iron so i will make some attempts to hide this in something else though i really cannot imagine what right now br br in addition the cap was not on tightly when the package arrived and the black goo had leaked out into into the packaging they did have it wrapped securely in bubble wrap though so it only got on that still not pleasant to have to clean the container before i could open it ,yuck , the best
i love the fact that this has so much iron in it i am a vegan and it is not easy to get iron the molasses is not quite as tasty as some i have had but it has about times more iron so i am ok with it i do not think anyone would buy molasses online if they just wanted a tasty food so i guess it is a winner ,a winner in the , not as good as it is
my cat suffers from bladder frequently since i have used this now since november he has not had attack of not being able to pass his urine i place a few drops in his food every week btw he does not like it but it at first i had to use eye and place a few drops in his mouth but after time he got used to it a giant thank you this has saved me so much worry whether or not he will be ok ,on cat with , cat grass
i bought this gift basket to break apart the items into smaller gifts for friends family it is over priced so i will not buy this again the contents are mainly food made in china like graham crackers and taffy etc one of the reasons i wanted it was for the beautiful coffee mug in this set basket item is really large due to all the fancy packaging like novelty wrapping cardboard for bulk so there is not that much in there it is fun to open and it will bring back memories of a state you in overall i was delighted with it but not the outrageous price for china made items and some items listed in the product were not included in this particular gift items vary per set ,basket delight , not as good as i have
children and there are many other well established toxic effects of acid in humans and animals look in the medical br br this product is sold in my neighborhood best price discount and whole foods in br br the brand whole foods own brand is also canola free it is much cheaper but watery in comparison i use it for cooking only plain and vanilla flavors though br br west soy rice beverage is also canola free it has a more neutral taste and less body they have a chocolate flavor br br many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes i find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products soy milk however has much more protein aside from being hard to digest i do not eat too much soy because of the anti nutritional components so i get my protein elsewhere ,best tasting chocolate beverage , a great product
it is a tiny bit grainy but it does not bother me a bit my kids really like it i use this as a chocolate syrup substitute in my kids milk to make the box go further they really love it it is great drinking it full strength too not too sweet we love it ,this milk is really good , best ever

flour type is better than regular flour whether frying it or baking it dough maintains and br i like it a lot ,great quality product , great product
bought four lb bags and use them to make bread and pizza dough if you have of that perfect italian pizza you had while through this flour is just the thing the dough even smells slightly better the final product produces the closest thing to that wonderful crust you cannot find in the usa it is worth the dough for the dough ,worth the money , not as good as it is
i make a lot of bread my family favorite is my i had been purchasing a very well known flour prior to trying this i am so happy i did try it i thought my italian breads could not get any better but this bring it up a notch i am comparing this to all the other flours if you are a bread maker i urge you to include in your next order ,best tasting soft wheat flour , great product
i thought the whole would be softer for spreading but they are not you have laying in a very sweet syrup i have only tried it on toast one time and it was way to sweet to eat the just lay on top i would not buy again save your money ,too sweet , not as good as it is
i have been to new orleans at one of the pat o and had there and this mix can taste just like what you would get at the restaurant the key is that the mix makes twice as much as it says it makes so if you go by the directions it will takes powdery so either use half as much powder or twice as much water mix with your favorite rum what they use vodka or and a nice sweet ,good drink mix if you the a little , not as good as it is
this is the best quality chamomile tea i have ever tried this is only oz so it is a little pricey but i will buy it again anyway because the quality is out of this world you will get three nice cups of tea out of one tablespoon but the first one is the best of course i like mine strong chamomile fans will love this tea ,heavenly , great tea

this hot sauce has an excellent taste unlike most of dave insanity sauces i put drops into a bowl of mild chili to make it hot like the other reviewer i would put it at about million having eaten fresh ghost peppers which are supposed to be million i would compare it to those br br million would mean that the sauce is pure that would make it expensive to manufacture or consume ,not really , best hot cocoa ever
the first ingredient is vinegar anyone who uses hot sauce should understand what that means i read the other reviews and was expecting a hell of a lot more than what i got it is got a good flavor to it but it is just a few above tabasco from what the other reviewers described it seems this product has a lot of in heat which means it is going to have a lot of in quality the bottle i got is really far far below my dave ghost pepper dave ultimate insanity blair after death da bomb beyond insanity da bomb ground zero it is a lacking sauce hell is hotter than this if you get lucky and get a hot bottle i use mine liberally on cheap pizza because that is all it is good for ,eh it is ok , not as good as it is
hot stuff way hotter than dave ultimate insanity only by some of blair sauces i do not think it is million though maybe million ,not but still pretty hot , not as good as it is
listen if you want a good taste and hot this the stuff it will not melt your eyes out but it is too hot to take straight one dab will do ya on a bite of pizza ,the best taste , not as good as it is
heat of pure cap or mad dog with i tested the three side by side with a dab on the finger dubious of the m claim maybe they mean it was made with million extract before diluted with the vinegar br br the thing with all those is that after a point it really does not matter they do not have flavor and you can always just add in a few extra drops i still appreciate the novelty br br either way it is priced nice and hot and unlike the other two sauces i have mentioned has a bit of flavor from the peppers and vinegar besides being simply being spicy oil i like it br br this is certainly going to become one of my regularly stocked hot sauces it would go really well in a bit of soup pasta mashed potatoes pizza chicken wings and so forth ,good with a bit of flavor no where , good product but
this hot sauce is great im new to the extreme heat sauces but i have previously tried fear sauce which has units and this sauce is by far alot hotter just two drops mixed with a little salsa on my taco had my mouth on fire its unlikely more like but i would recommend this product ,great heat , best hot cocoa ever
it is definatly not half the heat of ghost sauce maybe weaker may be a good dipping sauce ,is a , not as good as
not only does this sauce have a great taste but they have a small enough pour on top to allow you to pour small drops on your food if your careful or pour a lot it makes it easy to make something rather hot to what a heavy burn i love this stuff it is in a large ounce bottle and compared to sauces with less heat it has a great price ,great heat and great on top , great product
i have tried ghost pepper hot sauce back to back with z and z is considerably hotter i do not know if someone got a bad batch but it is painful to use more than a drop per square inch of food the first couple times you try it nice to mix with something you want hot without a vinegary taste makes anything spicy without changing the flavor but has a good flavor if you really go with it ,more than standard heat , not as good as it is
has a good taste it is a lil not bad maybe just a lil less hotter than ultra death sauces but has a better flavor ,nothing hot sauce , not as good as
really not much i can say this soup mix it taste great to us we always bought the canned stuff when making pot roasts or whatever then tried this well we will never go back to canned again well worth the money will be buying more ,onion soup mix , not as good as it is
these things are seriously beyond delicious just the right touch of saltiness to go with the sweet a perfect dessert or cheat snack for those long work days ,just awesome , good but not great
i had no idea something could taste this good i am not really a caramel person but if i had up the most perfect balance between sweet salty buttery richness it would be these caramel sea salt squares i found them at whole foods and they are expensive but worth every penny milk is the perfect compliment get some and you will not be disappointed you may be ruined for chocolate brownies ,the of my and it is not chocolate , not as good as it is
grilled out chicken and burgers for the entire family yesterday covered all of it with country bob seasoning and all purpose sauce the family loved it best sauce available cannot wait to use it on my steaks tonight ,amazing , best hot cocoa i have ever had
i am very happy with this tea i hesitated to order because of price but it comes in a nice tin with round tea bags it is great tasting i add ginger chips to it and it really is great when i have an upset stomach i just recently received my second order ,love this tea , great taste
i got it for under dollars shipped i pay more than eight because your not getting much cereal ,good deal when priced , great product
so you know you are dealing with a quality tea company the flavor is very similar to pg tips to me but stronger it is definitely a milk and sugar or honey tea due to it is strength and you will be happy that the milk does not water it down in any way with milk you will still enjoy the full tea flavor the milk only enhances the taste it is a very strong tea so be prepared for that otherwise it is a high quality full flavored tea at an economical price pg tips is still my favorite but since i cannot find it in my area but can find red label at my local walmart i am a convert due to the quality and the very similar flavor to pg tips maybe it is just me but i taste the you will not regret trying this tea ,a great cuppa tea , a great tea
my brother that he has purchased this exact product in this size from local indian grocers in houston tx and in tx area including one purchase at a walmart store in an area with significant indian the tea was reported to be a wonderful product for iced tea with a faint pleasant flowery aftertaste he will purchase it again and again ,tea , great tea

i bought two types of edible glitter to decorate a plain cake this one was by far the most stunning the other silver went on grey not that appetizing whereas this one had of sparkle and really made a highly recommended nice fast delivery too ,the best edible , great stuff
i need every color that is available love this product received shipment very fast very happy with this product will buy more ,wonderful , best ever
i ordered this glitter based on the fact it advertised it was edible i would not even try to feed this to anyone let alone on a cake for children i read several reviews and they all said how fantastic it was so i purchased on good when it arrived i wanted to see if it had a taste it tastes like i assume glitter would taste i packaged it to send it back but didn t if you want a trust worthy edible glitter stick with wilton products ,beware not edible , not as good as it is
this stuff worked out great for my ball birthday cake my customer loved it check it out br if you are looking for a great way to add that little extra something for your treats you found it ,super , great product
i used this product on a cake topper for a wedding cake that i made it worked out so well were very happy and got non stop compliments ,awesome product , great product
totally amazed at how far a small amount of this glitter can be spread i bought to decorate a wedding cake used less than of one it was beautiful worth the money ,a little goes a long way , great product
then then they need to update their listing to show such br br since i consider shipping to not be part of a product review i will not lower my star rating for this and consider this to be just a mention of this then but the shipping was slow i ordered it on june th a usps tracking delivery number was on the st to be fair but it took until july th for me to get this even taking into account that there was a major holiday july th that just seems too slow everything was packaged well enough although without anything like a blue ice pack to keep it cold for summer shipping but just took a long time to get here i do suspect the order was not truly shipped until the week before the july th weekend despite a tracking number being on june st ,very tasty product but please one odd , not as good as i be
this was a gift from my lil awesome great flavor can taste berries and i love it most likely will order more ,delicious , great product
if i could give this food a zero i would i tried it out and the dogs loved it until they all had the runs for days it was horrible smelled bad and i would never get it again ,horrible and gave the dogs the , my dog loves it
it is true you also need a decent scale i used a href http www amazon com gp product b g g x g scale a i tried the caviar recipe and everything worked perfectly on the first try it fast too under minutes i am sure faster once you get the hang of it it is fun very easy to make a juice recipe would be a really fun way to do an edible chemistry experiment with kids the kit comes with large enough samples that it looks like it will be good for uses ,great to , great product
i bought the kit to in the item is as described and arrived on time my complaint is that the instructions measure the required chemicals in of grams my kitchen scale measures as low as gram but does not do of grams i cannot find a kitchen scale that measures of grams therefore i find the kit difficult to use i would not recommend the kit because it requires the purchase of scale that can measure of grams ,as described but to use , not as good as it is
and could not hold any food the vet did all sorts of tests but i had to find something gentle enough for him to keep down that night i met a rep from nutro at my local petco she told me all about natural choice gave me and a website to learn more i purchased this canned food along with a small bag of the dry food to mix with it turns out the dog had some sort of but the food was the only food he could keep down to his strength due to skin allergies known to i have kept him on this food and find it is the best for him br br i just do not understand though how this is sold so cheap on amazon thru petco it is case in the store and on their website i think they should keep the price throughout ,healthy and safe , my dog loves it
not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies more on the sweet side coconut is listed in the ingredients but you certainly will not taste it my son liked them so they will not go to waste i would not buy them again ,needs more lemon flavor , not as good as it is
now i know this formulation is not the most natural or high grade one on the market right now believe me i have tried to get her interested in just about every brand with the word natural in the title and she is not having it she will not get the benefit of the food if she will not eat it so when i noticed she was eating all of her food when i put this in front of her i decided to stick with what is apparently working this is still premium food formulated for my twelve year old needs and she really really likes it nuff said ,cat loves this stuff , great product
these are perfect if you want to add some beans to another soup or just to have any size portion of black beans right away as they are dried they last forever and you can have any portion size you want with a little water and microwave they up to give you really good quality black beans i like these better than canned black beans and i do not have any more at any time than i want adding them to soups which are too watery is a great way to thicken them up you cannot do that with canned beans which are mostly water in the first place i have not calculated the price out but these are probably not any more expensive than canned beans because you are not buying any water would be perfect for camping food as well ,up to be whole beans in a , not as good as i be
i was born and raised on the east coast new jersey i have loved tasty my whole life so its a great present to find some flavors or twists on old familiar ,great new on old favorite , great taste
i got this product for my husband he loves dr pepper it came before the date it was suppose to arrive on he loves it he wants to drink it but he doesnt he is keeping it as a item they dont make them anymore the item was packed good and safe and everything was there no complaints ,dr pepper , great product
shipping was quite a bit but the bottles were all unbroken and in good shape since dublin no longer makes d p i wanted some bottles for a keep sake these meet the bill over all good experience ,dr pepper , good
this is the new dublin dr pepper now bottled in texas this is produced after dr pepper force dublin out of production it is not the same as dublin dr pepper that is why it is so cheap if you want the real thing you will pay more for it ,not dr pepper , not as good as it is
especially as we get older the lining of our stomach gets more sensitive to harsh chemicals and low acid coffee is a common sense substitute that loses no aroma or taste in the process highly recommended ,great coffee , great coffee
i received my cases of rice works and the chips are awesome tasting and a great price but in every single bag the chips were smashed into little pieces so i guess i have bags of salad or but not chips ,awesome taste but , great chips
i was delighted to find this product online because i cannot always find it in the stores however each package i have opened thus far is at least half reduced to crumbs because of poor packaging for shipping i doubt that i will order more using this method ,product delicious but shipping , great product
taste of the salsa is delicious and the fresh chips go with lots of other foods br br the main ingredient is whole grain brown rice and yes this is good for you i have not had regular potato chips in quite a while but i would imagine that these chips have less fat then potato chips have there are no trans fats no cholesterol no preservatives no and artificial flavors they are even wheat and gluten free very good they have less than gram of sugar per serving br br they do have some sodium they have about mg of sodium in every serving and there are roughly five servings to a bag br br if you have further questions the company maintains a website and an email address so you can contact them good br br overall these are some very awesome chips i highly recommend them enjoy ,all right by me , the best chips i have ever had
of finding them as soon as i discovered them on the list of foods carried by amazon i ordered a box br when the box of chips arrived i opened a bag of the fresca chips only to find not a single whole chip the largest chip was no more than a quarter the size of a whole chip it was impossible to use them to dip with i hoped that was just an bag of the product but most of the bags had similarly damaged chips on average there were only a couple of whole chips to each bag br it was very disappointing to have a great style chip reduced to during shipping because of the condition of the chips upon arrival i will not buy them from amazon com again br great chips when they are whole a great disappointment when they are reduced to crumbled pieces ,great chips bad shipping , great chips
i have tried all of the chips except for the sesame soy which i plan to try soon i have a un opened bag still so far prefer the sweet chips these chips are pretty healthy as far as chips go made from brown rice and pop when chewed on i bought them top food here in washington state costco has the larger oz bag in the sweet flavor only price was at top foods for oz size on amazon for same size br costco was for the oz size ,these are okay prefer sweet ones , great chips
these are the best tasting chips ever i cannot get them anywhere here in area so went to the internet to find them would not you know amazon came thru only concern is that they arrive a little crumbled i guess considering they are being shipped however not so in store when i could still get them here really grateful that i can get them at all ,rice works chips , great chips
the chips are awesome i first bought them at costco and now i cannot get them there any more the bags at costco were about times larger than the one i recieved from amazon the arrived mostly in tiny crumbles of chips and the bags were about full i will not waste my money buying them from amazon again as the shipping is just not up to par if you can find the chips retail i would advise buying them that way their website says that super target and costco carries them but have not been able to find them there recently ,great chips but terrible shipping , great chips
i am constantly looking for gluten free foods that i might enjoy for health reasons i was excited to see these in my local store not only need you be concerned just with the msg and soy protein be aware of the weight in the packages the bags purchased stated oz one seemed to be much lighter than the other when i got them home i put them in zip lock bags to check the contents the bag that had seemed very light compared to the others was indeed less than a third of the amount in the other bags it was no more than a very small handful it did not contain crushed or broken chips it contained very few chips this is not the time for who want to and grow to cheat consumers is this a growing trend i find it so ,for weight in the bag , not as good as i be
love these chips i think there are so many gf baked goods be they less than exciting rice chips heavy breads grainy cakes etc that just fall short of taste and texture i am knocked out by how crisp and tasty these are they are much like a popular orange chip but better even fresher tasting if i do not take a serving and put the bag away first i am very likely to through it in one sitting products like these make me feel like i am not sacrificing anything at all for the sake of going gf ,my fave gf chip delicious , great taste
i love these chips they are addictive it hard to just eat a few i tried the chili flavor that has great reviews and i do not think they compare to the salsa fresca if you like a chip with a little kick these are perfect ,salsa is the best , great chips
the chips are delicious i absolutely love them they are very addicting excellent for people with gluten wheat allergies the only thing was that during the shipping process the chips became broken and crumbled not as bad as i thought after reading other reviews but still quite a few crumbs in the bottom of the bags i would order again ,salsa chips , great chips
these are great chips i have tried both the salsa fresca and sweet chili and love them both if i had to choose one over the other would take the salsa fresca just my personal preference will be trying the sea salt in the near future br br can t go wrong with these chips ,chip with a great flavor it is good for you , great chips
these things are like eating chips with seasoning salt they are remarkably high in calories too ,hard as a rock with about as much flavor , great chips
i make for my wife in the she goes to work br and i use flavored coffee in the machine and it is hard to find br hazelnut flavored ground coffee at a reasonable price or finding just flavored br beans this pound bag from coffee bean direct was an excellent price and br the flavor was very good also a great choice for who grind their br own coffee beans ,my wife coffee , great coffee
this coffee tastes like a good coffee with a mild hazelnut flavor it is good i am a big fan of hazelnut and i would like the flavor to be a little stronger br br my husband loves the aroma of this one and he prefers it to the hazelnut because it is a little darker roast than the ,a roast with mild hazelnut flavor , good coffee
smells great looks great and tastes great as a guy who likes strong espresso type coffee i was surprised and impressed by the bold flavor with just a hint of hazelnut with just a little half and half its great first thing in the morning ,great mild brew , great taste
my husband loves hazelnut coffee but the price of flavored coffee is so high i used to only give it to him once a week but now i can afford to give him his favorite everyday he loves the rich flavor ,wonderful coffee beans , great coffee
i have been buying this coffee for at least years and i love it smooth taste with a hint of hazelnut friends enjoy coming over just for a good cup of coffee ,great coffee , great coffee
this is a nice middle it is a good tasting roast coffee with some hazelnut flavor i would say it is as good or better than the wal mart hazelnut coffee more of the hazelnut flavor is often too much for br br it not the best coffee i ever had but it is just fine considering that it only costs about lb in the current market is about br br my only problem is what the product is lbs it is hard to keep that amount fresh unless you are a restaurant when a package is opened i package the full lbs in wal mart coffee bags lb per bag then double bag it into freezer bags and pop that into the freezer that way it stays fairly fresh as by the aroma which is really nice when fresh and less so when not ,very ok price ok coffee , good coffee but not a great price
trying something new with this coffee did not blow me away but for the price it is excellent i do not have anything bad to say about it other than it is a big bag and i am mildly concerned with freshness toward the end but we burn thru beans pretty fast d ,excellent flavor for the price , not as good as it is
i have been so called a hazelnut coffee freak for about years and i have to say that i found the match to the hazelnut coffee my father in law offered me whenever i was over visiting he has passed away so i can not say if it was from coffee bean direct but darn it it sure taste just like what he brewed up thanks you for the good cup of coffee and at a reasonable price i got this page book marked for later orders ,now some good coffee two thumbs up , good coffee but not a great price
this coffee is good i have tried a lot of hazelnut coffees and this is one of the best i got from amazon it has a darker and richer flavor than most hazelnut coffee it was fresh and tasty and the price was great at about per pound with subscribe and save i will order it again ,good stuff , good coffee
finally an affordable flavored coffee worth drinking br coffee bean direct hazelnut is a really smooth medium roast coffee with a definite hazelnut flavor br the flavoring is not sweetened which is a real plus especially if you do not like sweeteners in your coffee if you do you have complete control yourself br the flavor is not overpowering but is enough to let you know you are drinking a hazelnut coffee br those who have complained may have received a bad batch usually the blend is good and roasting but as with any other food product and do happen br i have been using coffee bean direct coffee for about five years and have not yet received a bad batch br this one is a winner ,really good hazelnut coffee , good coffee but not a great price
my husband and i love it and will follow them where ever they will go br br wood br br because of amazon and it is fast shipping and regular monthly program we will buy more grocery products from them it is easy fast and cheaper than the store br br now looking for more products that save us a trip to the store thank you amazon you make it easier for us br br i remember years ago when my grandmother would call the grocery store give them a list and they delivered it to her home now i have amazon to help us in our senior years br br great program for or busy people reliable money saving and great quality br br only problem i had was with light i ordered was hard as a rock like it had been in warehouse for years br br wood ,finally found the best in hazelnut with flavor , great product
before i say anything else i am mindful of tastes as well as differences in processing from one batch of coffee to another that said i found the coffee bean direct hazelnut coffee to be evenly roasted medium and bearing a robust and rich hazelnut flavor from the first to the last cup since this is my first bag of hazelnut coffee from with which i am very pleased i will update my comments specifically the consistency of the roasting flavoring process from batch to batch with my next purchase if my other purchases are any indication i a consistent product ,delicious , not as good as i have
the only other flavored coffee i have used was nestle hazelnut it too was a whole bean i really enjoyed that one and thought i pick this one up br br where the nestle shared flavor with the bean this one overpowers this one has a burnt note that seems flavoring instead of roast related i like and this a is not anything like hazelnut br br now i have of the stuff my mistake br br more info br i am about of the way through the bag my opinion has not changed also i would note a very flavor today grind seems almost of the flavoring it appears they really do not have the adding of flavoring down the intensity of the flavoring is all over the park ,awful , not as good as i be
this is not a deeply roasted or rich tasting coffee at all it is very light with sized beans clearly a blend some beans are normal size and some are tiny the hazelnut aroma and flavor is good but this coffee is not strong at all even using twice as many grounds i could not get enough coffee flavor from these beans br br people who like very weak coffee will probably love this people who like starbucks will not like this one bit ,very lightly , not as good as i will
anyone who knows will like the new packaging of plastic i wonder how long they packaged in layers of paper br br if you have not had this very rich puerto rican coffee you must sample it and then buy in bulk juan valdez might have a good bean but the puerto do it better ,flavorful brew with , great coffee
i love this coffee i tried it in puerto rico on our and am hooked i may even go back to puerto rico and get more ,awesome , great coffee
this cake always turns out consistently sweet and moist but bland compared to the new duncan hines version of german chocolate cake this is not impressive it will do when you are craving something different from regular chocolate cake though ,but bland , great taste
this creme brulee is as good as any homemade why bother with homemade when you can get just as delicious from a box easier to make too ,creme of the , great coffee
products are always the best i have used them for years because they have unique items that are tasty and easy to prepare you absolutly cannot go wrong with this creme brulee why spend a ton of money at a restaurant when you can serve it by at home ,always the best , great taste
this creme brulee is better than some of the better french restaurants i have been to i just wish my local grocery stores would carry it ,excellent , great coffee
it tastes like jack links brand not wild bill even the texture is totally different from wild bill not recommended ,this does not taste at all like wild , not as good as it is
i blame myself for trying to save a buck this coffee is way too weak for my tastebuds they say it is a dark blend but it is not even close to a dark roast i buy at stores in the end i have blend each can with a pound of dark roast and it is ok ,will not but again , not as good as i be
if you like a rich dark coffee this product is not for you we would been looking for an organic alternative and i have tried some great ones so we ordered this when it was on special unfortunately we ordered cans to get the discount and now we are stuck with organic but very dull tasting coffee to make the best of it we have bought other tried and true rich dark brands to mix with it very disappointing ,organic but not tasty , great coffee
i bought this along with the regular dark roast at a considerable discounted price well lets just say you get what you pay for the flavor really is not there and this as well is not much of a dark roast ,okay , great product
we use this coffee at my office people like it a lot and i feel good about it being organic and fair trade ,delicious coffee , great coffee
organic fair trade cafe coffee brews a great pot of coffee organic makes it healthy and fair trade makes it a responsible choice the dark blend is a flavorful choice ,great coffee and too , great coffee
i prefer rich strong coffee and this product is a bit bland for my taste ,decent but not great , great coffee
we like dark roast coffee because it has more body and tastes stronger this coffee is just that it is great that it is both organic and fair trade the pack means you have coffee for a while and the price is very good you can either recycle the can or it around the house all in all a very good deal ,good coffee , good coffee
nice body and full roasted flavor at a reasonable price for a organic fair trade i would buy the discounted pack again but full price cost it too much to overcome my desire for an affordable coffee ,good stuff , good
i ordered this for my mother in law who could not find this product anywhere near where she lives she is really enjoying this product ,orange , great product
very fresh and tasty soft buns that go well with my omaha steak burger patties br they store well ,very fresh and tasty , great taste
chewy and friends are my favorite candy period i love them so much br cough br so when i found these i was really excited and bought a pack hoping they would have that same tartness that makes and friends so good br nope tasted just like every other jelly gummy type candy i was very let down it was okay for jelly gummy but do not expect much ,eh , great taste
of blueberries and taste a lot like sweetened cranberries only better they do not have the acrid taste that cranberries sometimes have but i will say that if you dislike cranberries this may not be your favorite thing br br of all the lingonberry products i have tried jams and preserves the preserves are my very favorite the berries are whole or in the color is true and the fluid part is completely smooth rich and has a dense texture the flavor is strong enough to stand up to the density and full flavor of a biscuit but it is also great on bagels or english muffins or toast and although i have not tried doing it i have heard this is a great product to use in baking this would be great in a berry muffin or as a complement to game dishes br br i highly recommend this ,so good i eat it from the jar , good but not great
terms of pleasing every family member and guest when it comes to eating this jam straight from the spoon personally for me it is really tart tangy and a little strong while with cloudberry preserves i could probably eat the whole jar without tasting or a strong tartness personally for me this lingonberries preserves tastes great with vanilla yogurt it reminds me of fruit in the bottom according to felix on their jar they say that these lingonberries during summertime in the ingredients in these preserves are wild lingonberries sugar and fruit felix also suggest putting these preserves on meat i ordered these jars from the seller on amazon and they did a good job wrapping and bubble wrap to protect each jar from breaking during transport anyways i highly recommend trying swedish lingonberries and swedish preserves both of these swedish treats offer different tastes that are yummy and good ,nice treat , great but not great
of them i usually get a package of about or half breasts and a package of thighs and one pack of mix will cover it all if you roll it on a plate it becomes very sticky when it gets wet so it will stick to the plate your fingers and of course the chicken pieces i have also used a little bit of plum jam brushed on the chicken before coating it and thats very good too but honestly you do not need to add anything it is delicious the way it is cook it long enough to get browned and crispy and remove it to a serving dish right away so it does not sit in the grease and you will be extremely happy with the results i would really be interested to hear from someone who has never cooked with this before and see what they think ,family favorite , good for you
have you ever try bbq chicken wings br use this and it would be delicious br i used it a lot but usually bought it in super market today i did not find it there so i came online and order more here price is much better here ,bbq , not as good as it is

this product is so great my daughter who is extremely pick loves it and she is also gluten free so she can actually have this br not bad for calories per serving br this will be a great dish to take for thanksgiving dinner ,awesome corn cake , great product
i like to make this when i make chicken or dirty rice it is a nice compliment and does not dry out as much as corn muffin mix which i used to use this packet water half a stick of butter and a can of corn is all it takes then bake for minutes it is moist and sweet it does not last long in my house ,yummy treat , great product
i make this product when we have any kind of mex meal everyone loves it it is easy to make and tastes great ,love this stuff , great product
seems that any item this good and tasty would disappear from stock the stores so glad to find it on amazon and at the rate we eat this especially in the winter with chili will not have any problem going thru the bulk order of br thank you amazon and chi chi ,good , good
i had a taco party and every single guest asked me how do i make the i run out every year ,outstanding , great product
this little packet makes a whole pan full of sweet corn goodness is it a side dish or a dessert or both you decide easy to prepare and delicious on the table ,sweet corn cake , delicious
i love chi chi corn cake and i love that i can purchase it from amazon my local grocery store stopped carrying it and i was so happy to see that i could order it from amazon i would give it stars but not everyone in my family loves it i do not know why it is so yummy it is a delicious side to any mexican meal ,love corn cake , great product
i grew up in southern california so i have had my share of sweet corn cakes at local restaurants this mix is a great way to make these at home i prepared a package of these for a friend of mine who lives on the east coast and had never tried a corn cake she now addicted but cannot find them at her local store thank goodness for amazon ,tasty unique treat , great product
i have tried to duplicate this without having to buy the prepackaged stuff but have never come close the stuff this creates is outstanding in texture and flavor i have always like the little of corn that they sell at the mex chain and this is almost a spot on of it great stuff for even picky eaters like young kids ,outstanding flavor , not as good as it is
i made the recipe on the package and my family loved this dish i will make it many many times my grandson said he wanted a whole just for himself ,this is some stuff , great product
i had never made this or had it at a mexican food diner so i did not know what to expect it is good and very moist but if you use corn with added sugar in it your muffins or corn loaf will be very sweet i will make my own cream corn to add next time instead of using libby canned cream corn which is high in salt and sugar i like sweets but this was a little over the top using canned cream corn the first ingredient in the dry mix is sugar not corn masa as listed on the amazon site so be advised this is definitely a dessert ,first ingredient is sugar dessert for sure , not as good as it is
sooo happy amazon sells this the one grocery store that has it in my neighborhood is closing this is delicious perfect for a night ,amazingly delicious , great snack
delicious reminds me exactly of the corn cake they use to serve at their restaurants i make this with every mexican night we have at home ,yum , delicious
i have got no in the kitchen but in today economy really appreciate guests who contribute to the by bringing a side dish i would sampled this corn cake at a friends and could not believe it came from a mix i immediately ordered the mix from amazon and put it to the test so easy water melted butter and a cake pan even i could not mess it up i took it to the next gathering where it was a hit i only wish it came in a smaller shipment min shipment is a pack of but since everyone always seems to want the recipe we can share ,makes a a little , not as good as it is
i too am so glad amazon sells this i sometimes add a cup of sugar when i want it sweeter ,i love it too , great taste
all the chi chi closed in my area i was able to get this mix at the grocery store but lately it has not been on the shelves i am so happy to have found it on amazon this mix is awesome great for taco night ,corn mix , great product
our daughter was very unhappy because she could not find chi chi sweet corn cake mix in her grocery stores thanks to amazon com the fix was easy we had corn cake while dining on lake heard the grand kids were enjoying more chi chi corn cake last night thank you ,a must have for our , great product
i really like this product when my grocery stopped carrying it i ordered it through the mail this is more of a quick bread than a cake and it requires a can of cream style corn the result is very moist and has a good corn flavor i bake it in muffin in cupcake papers and a dozen are small it makes about good sized muffins i also bake these longer than on the package because i seem to like things that are more done than many people these store well in a plastic bag in the refrigerator if they are not all eaten by the end of the meal ,really good gluten free , great product
chi chi sweet corn cake is awesome the stores in our area stopped stocking this item so happy to have found it on amazon com no other corn bread cake mix comes close to being as good as this it goes great with taco and chili we also like to add in some frozen corn before we bake it yum ,love this stuff , great product
so so there was great reviews on product only made it once will try it again ,thought it would be better , great product
i have been a fan of this stuff for years make sure you stir it up after you pull it out of the microwave since the grease seems to float to the top it is quick easy and makes for a tasty lunch when you are short on time or do not feel like going out for lunch ,great for lunch , great product
it is not healthy despite the description above though i did not buy it for that reason i love pasta but for my uses preparing a fresh batch then adding the sauce would be both expensive and time consuming this is the best solution i will buy this variety again in the future in the can version for more days ,food it is best , best sauce ever
great for a snack i eat a calorie day diet i eat this between lunch and work and it hits the spot an entire bowl is calories arrived on time and its easier and cheaper than buying in bulk at or other such not costco but i dont have my own member card ,mmmmm , great taste
this lb box of chocolates was a wonderful gift for my year old niece the quality of the chocolates was amazing but more importantly was the long lasting pleasure the young lady got a double gift thanks amazon a href http www amazon com gp product b see candies lb assorted chocolates a ,a wonderful gift , great product
speaking as another i think the first rule for these delicious treats is to not order them during spring or summer in fact your bet is to only order them in the dead of winter lol as long as you do that be prepared for a truly amazing treat this package comes with bite sized the chocolate is high quality the nuts are crunchy and the overall taste could not be better definitely worth the price ,do not order these in the summer , great taste
i cannot believe that i found these on amazon i became addicted to the little covered macadamia delights in and thought that i would be doomed to a life without them back in the states be warned consumer highly addictive highly addictive recently i the of my last box but i have found them again i can live i can live ,eat with , not as good as it is
i really enjoyed eating this macadamia delights from the chocolate has a great and not too sweet taste the nuts are a bit small if you are used to larger varieties but that is a small problem br br i found they were not good for my feeding stuffing a whole box down in about minutes is not a good idea as the chocolate can leave a bit of an aftertaste in the throat taken at a more pace they are a real treat ,not by the box , not as good as it is
i got this product ship one day express unfortunately when it arrived and i opened it all i saw was a big blob of melted chocolate with little macadamia nuts in the center of the holders ,i it goes down the same way , not as good as it is
the actual product deserves stars the reason i gave it stars is because its like three dollars at com that is where i order it from not amazon much lower prices ,yummy , not as good as it
i did not buy them here but i did buy them from highway farmers market here in and they are wonderful they are worth a try ,quality chocolate , good
this will be a short review for me br br i am somewhat of a tea connoisseur so for me to give a tea stars well this is a first for me in an amazon review br br like other reviews of this product it is a beautiful delight to watch this hand tea in the pot delicate thin first flush leaves a beautiful red center of hibiscus the liquor is a light honey color and the apricot overtones are pronounced on the palate br br i would recommend this tea for anyone who enjoys green or white teas wants to become more familiar with them or as a gift for someone ,from who better , not as good as i have
i only use c h sugar for all my baking needs and i go through it fast with a lot of baking i looked on amazon to see if i could purchase it in a case for ease and cost savings at the grocery store one lb carton costs less than so to get three of them it would cost or less here on amazon it is plus shipping that for a product that is almost times more expensive than if i just purchase it at the local grocery store i love amazon and was really shocked to see this price this is a definite no thanks i know better than to purchase this item here ,too expensive on amazon , great product
this is the sugar i use for all my white sugar needs it is very fine somewhere between the dust like qualities of powdered sugar and regular sugar it dissolves very well into drinks without that somewhat odd tastes powdered sugar can have because of the corn starch or the of not dissolving completely like granulated sugar which makes it perfect for cold drinks br when baking with it because it is so fine i usually use a cup cup tablespoon instead of a full cup that seems to work well for me br excellent for and fudge because it is so fine and dissolves so well ,sugar , not as good as it is
layers for a firm pound cake like layer cake intended for decoration wilton butter cake recipe this is a pretty cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well i had already baked several of the layers with regular granulated sugar before i ran out and decided to use some of this baking sugar be forewarned this sugar makes cakes far too tender the layer literally fell apart coming out of the pan and it was well cooled and in a pan liberally covered in cake release even when i was mixing the batter it for some reason stuck to my bowl and was impossible to scrape entirely out i am sure this is good for and such but i would never attempt to use it again for a cake or even cookies you would never get them out of or off the pan ,do not use this sugar for if you to them , a little baking
we have been trying various including and this is by far the best it is very of in and produced the risotto of the five brands of rice we have tried br br be sure to have an airtight container to store the unused rice from each package the vacuum pack plastic is too stiff to close well ,the best for , great product
great for risotto creates creamy finished product while a good al bite better than any other rice i have used ,perfect for , great product
if you want to make authentic italian risotto for a reasonable price buy this rice is in my opinion the very best for making risotto you have to follow the true process starting with then the rice then with white wine and finally adding hot stock in small amounts while stirring often if you follow this procedure and or find a good recipe you will be with some of the most mouth tender rice you have ever had why pay for it in a restaurant when it is so easy to make at home ,makes the best , great product
very crunchy and salty just like described i can also tell they use a lot of artificial color not the best caviar might be really good for sushi ,it is not bad , great snack
my dog is simply crazy about these treats but what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi long lasting morsel of enjoyment in to that since these treats are all natural they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats making them extra healthy br br the price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you cannot beat the quality ,over for this treat , my dog loves these
all the dogs on my christmas list loved this they ate it right away ,dog treats , my dog loves it
these seeds are awesome good size with the perfect amount of spice buffalo to ranch flavoring i have only been able to find them here locally at or other gas ordering them via amazon is obviously cheaper and saves me nearly dollars buying the box ,best new flavor on the market , great snack
this new flavor is great not too spicy as i thought it would be in fact it has the flavor of buffalo sauce but not the heat which i like i tried these from the local convenience store but from amazon the shipped price is really good so i bought a couple of ten packs cannot wait i have been out for a few days now and need something to snack on at work ,new flavor is great , not as good as it is
these are jumbo and flavored nicely i ended up saving per pack as well good deal once u go jumbo u never go back ,great , great
these are good sized seeds and they taste good not over roasted i know this as i rinse them before i eat them the flavor is a little strong for me which if you knew me would not surprise you i am not the biggest fan on spices that add heat if you like buffalo wings i am sure you will love these it was the ranch part of the flavor that caught my eye ,nice size good taste , good for you
looking for a good tasting jumbo sunflower seed that is not too salty and has an outstanding flavor then these are for you br br they have an awesome flavor are jumbo size and the price will not hurt your i would recommend them to anyone unfortunately they are hard to find and when you do find some they fly off the shelf so they must be good ,not your sunflower seeds , delicious
the seeds are large and roasted perfectly i lived in upstate ny near buffalo when the buffalo wings started and have been eating them ever since these seeds do not even have the to buffalo wings if you are looking for that taste do not buy them if you are looking for a great spicy ranch taste then these are for you the only flavored seeds available near me are the plain ranch they are ok but these have that extra bit of spice that really makes them great br br will be buying these again and highly recommend them to anyone who likes the spicy yet not too hot ranch taste ,should be spicy , good for you
it was this or a big tub of spice drops these are better for diabetics they did not last long and my wife enjoys the mess i make round the la z boy ,good snack , good
the only thing keeping this product from five stars are all of the broken shells at the top of the bag i found a number of half shells however when i got to the bottom i realized that many of the seeds had there in a pile of shell and seasoning salt blow the seasoning off and you may lose some seeds as well otherwise a great eating experience ,good flavor and good size , not as good as it is
the jumbo size is great and makes for easier consuming those of you ranch heads like me do yourself a favor and immediately this flavor is even better easily the best david has to offer great price on amazon especially since these flavor seeds are pretty hard to find in regular stores ,best seeds , great taste
these are the best sunflower seeds ever the bigger size makes them easier to eat load of flavor in every bag ,yummy yummy , delicious
which you are actually paying by the way i do not often find items too salty but this on the ridiculous imo i the jumbo size seeds as they are much more enjoyable than the regular sized sunflower seeds by david br br i will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the david have br br update i finished all but a little of the case of david buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds i compared them back to back the jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to david it will be interesting how i will find the jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile right now they seem a bit under flavored still that is preferable to david of salt ,way too salty , not as good as i like
the maxwell house international coffee vanilla nut cafe is absolutely my favorite flavor seems to be extremely difficult to locate now though last purchase was made through amazon and hoping it will become available again soon ,vanilla nut cafe favorite flavor , not as good as it is
i could not really taste the bergamot in this tea it had more of a slight orange peel taste since it is organic i expected a cleaner richer taste it is ok but not as good as the regular twinings earl grey i have had other brands of organic that were superior to either of the twinings but at a much higher price ,not as good as regular , not as good as it is not as good as
my two cats used to love this formula but i guess they got tired of it or maybe the formula was changed i only feed it occasionally now ,pleasing cats , cat cat food
excellent energy drink i drink one a day before i go for my daily walk gives me a nice boost i like the taste may take a few too get used to it no jitters just a boost ,sooo glad i found this , great product
i started using over two year ago gives just the right boost i needed to exercise in the mornings no crash or after affects has a great taste nothing strong or overwhelming ,great taste , great
the description of the item is small pieces diced i would call them chopped they are basically what you would find on a banana split or a or perhaps decorating a chocolate cake or cupcake i like the toasted flavor and put them on oatmeal they do not come in a sealed package as shown in the photo mine came in a folded over plastic bag inside a cardboard box ,nuts , not as good as it is
it i can tell br br you get eight cans of ocean whitefish tuna feast eight more cans of savory salmon feast with cod and eight more cans still of shrimp feast very good br br the food does have some nutritional content i always look for that when i buy food for the cat there is some vitamin e a d b and b i like that naturally ask your vet if you have any concerns about your cat personal individual needs for nutritional content in their daily diet br br if you catch a sale on this stock up however i would use these cans of food within six months of buying them br br overall this is one of the better brands of cat food out there and i recommend it your cat will love it and it has nutritional content which is great for them too ,one great big huge high five from my cat , cat cat cat food
drawn to this product because it is called a feast but i was somewhat put off by it being a fancy feast my cat certainly deserves a feast i mean he runs himself from morning till night going after and by the end of the day he is and frustrated too since i had him and all but he do not need anything fancy that is for sure i just want him to enjoy a cat feast and leave it at that he is not one of them cat that around with his bushy tail around like some lady feline i know my would be in cat heaven if they changed the name to feast or feast so i am giving this product stars five stars because it is a pretty great feast minus three stars because the name and plus one star because i like to lick the can ,my cat smells like cat food , cat cat cat food
great oysters fast shipping cannot find them local so i took a chance and they were great they were frozen when i got them and package was well packed ,great , great for
or six right out of the container as soon as i opened it i just could not stop myself they were that good for all that chewing my jaw is none the worse for the wear so for those of you out there that are real jerky fans this is definitely worth trying br br update i did a little research because i was curious as to why everyone thought this jerky was too salty i looked up the nutrition facts on all flavors both the original peppered contain mg of sodium the wood smoked had mg and the teriyaki has only mg of sodium so if you thought the others were too salty or are worried about this jerky being too salty try the teriyaki i highly recommend it it is not too salty just a hint of sweet from the teriyaki but still nice pepper flavor as well ,misleading reviews , not as good as i be
with jack links buying king b it looks like they have the original beef jerky strips in this label with the same great results i hope they keep up with the demand as everyone else finds them as i did thanks for bring them back jack links ,b jerky found , great product
i dont review often but this stuff is just what i was looking for i ordered about of jerky to try all the types i havent yet tried and i popped this can first br br i already found what i want the taste is excellent i ma fan of hickory smoked stuff as it is the texture is good not too tough and definately not too tender br br what else do you need good taste good texture wish it was a bit cheaper at lb but what can ya do ,excellent taste texture , not as good as it is
these beef jerky strips are really good texture is just right flavor is peppery but also just right could be more smoky for me this is a repeat buy on my part ,good stuff , good
just like old style jerky whole strips of meat not chips yum yum peppery ,jerky , great chips
this stuff is the real deal not too soft not too hard not too salty no fat and a great smokey flavor with just a touch of spice that makes your tongue for a commercially produced product this is really a satisfying strip of jerky i was pleasantly surprised and will definately purchase again ,excellent jerky , not as good as it is
walked into a convenience store and bought this for and was like nice asked the counter person if i could buy it at their rate and got the brush off did a little research and voila amazon comes through again bought two jars and the wife and kids cleaned me out i will be getting this sent to me monthly soon ,yum yum , great product
as processed mass produced go this is one of the best i have had it compares with king b i do not care for all of the preservatives and processing but that comes with eating anything these days unless you go and find a you can buy from direct br fresh game jerky would be the next step if you can find it ,good jerky , great taste
we had been looking for king b brand jerky for months before contacting jack links to find out what happened they informed us that their smokehouse brand was indeed new for the king b products with on them keeping the same recipe we a jar and were not disappointed the product was exactly what we had remembered the original king b to be i will definetly be ordering this again ,perfect , not as good as it is
this jerky reminds me a little of the artisan jerky i used to be able to find in california the strips are thin so they are easy to bite and the flavor is slightly spicy and definitely smokey br br my husband absolutely loved it he been taking pieces per day in his lunch and they never come back home with him the way other snacks sometimes do i am buying more while they are on sale ,excellent , great taste
let me tell you that this beef jerky has me wanting more i have never tasted a jerky with more flavor and taste i recommend it to anyone wanting a little more out of their jerky a ,wow , good
over the past two years thanks to amazon i have been sampling jerky from literally all over the u s i finally found a tasty jerky that does not give my a workout great meat flavor an excellent snack ,tasty jerky , great taste
i miss the king b style and the regular jerky too thanks jack links for at least offering this ,at least you can find b in some , great taste
a href http www amazon com gp product b jack link smokehouse beef jerky strips wood smoke count jar a these are the real deal when it comes to jerky the whole family loves them when the grandkids come over they wipe me out the year old looks for the container sitting on the microwave and says paw paw stick these come once a month via the amazon subscribe and save just another great quality jack link product one of the few companies that got big but never quality in the process ,great sticks , great for
you will love this jerky if you are a beer drinker recommend this product for sure for them nights around the ,awsome jerky , delicious
these are great tasting and have good consistency and easy to eat on the run no mess ,very good flavor and , great taste
this jerky is the bomb it is by fare the best i have ever had and i have had a lot of jerky in my day ,best ever , best ever
the product is a good value for the amount you get however it is way too salty the product is very dry and firm i think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half ,salt , good but not great
i am really disappointed with the changes in quality it is not even the same product that we used to love a couple of years ago the product was consistently fantastic but now the taste quality of the meat and freshness are hit or miss and recently it is all been a miss ,not what it used to be , great product
great flavor and texture it may not be the best jerky out there but for the price i could not find any better it comes in a few different flavors so there is bound to be one you like i just wish the shelf life was longer i would love to keep this with the emergency food water ,great flavor wish it had a longer life , great taste
i purchased the wood smoked flavor the reviewers who said that these are too salty were right they tastes like sticks of salts if you nibble on them very slowly then they tastes ok as the salts slowly if you take a big bite then it would be like biting into a chunk of salt i love the texture and the of this beef jerky but i would not buy it again because of the high sodium content ,very salty , not as good as it is
this is for all the beef jerky lovers out there if you like jerky this is the best tasting stuff that ive found anywhere all of the flavors are great the black peppered in my opinion is the best and the wood smoked is a little dry but still good i would recommend it to anybody ,great stuff , best ever
i used to eat these king b beef jerky sticks all the time when i was younger they were my favorite i figured once king b was gone so was my beloved jerky but luckily jack links has brought it back this jerky is above and beyond any of that overly sweet bagged jerky jack links sells no instead this is the way jerky should be nice and chewy and salty yum i know some people on here complained about the saltiness but i do not think they are overly salty they are just plain delicious order some you will not regret it ,b beef jerky are back , not as good as i be
this beef jerky is extremely salty i tried the wood smoked flavor and i figured people were just being a bit picky however it really is overpowering and although it has a decent smoky flavor the salt is just way too much the container says mg sodium or of daily value for one serving i would recommend trying a different product ,believe the reviews way too salty , delicious
these are the best jerky strips i have ever tasted our family has been eating them for years and they are typically a christmas delight ,yummy jerky , great taste
the smokehouse jerky is some of the best out there a perfect quick snack it has s great smoke flavor and texture i even started a subscription to get it once a month save by doing it br the only con would be a little on the salty side if you like jerky you cannot go wrong with this ,one of the best , great taste
there are literally hundreds of jerky type products out there this is simply my favorite real strips of beef not ground up that tastes like meat instead of preservatives without teriyaki or any other flavoring or sauce good price good product and great taste you will be happy with this one when i am looking for a non sugary snack i reach for this first ,the good stuff , great product
a brought this into the office and i am so i am not big beef jerky fan but this stuff totally falls under my much yum category ,much yum , great taste
this jerky is extremely addictive i have had most every other brand of jerky and this is by far the best jerky i have ever had it was originally king b jerky ,the best , best ever
i love all different types of beef jerky but not this one it has the flavor of grocery store bought beef jerky once you get over the overwhelming taste of salt these sticks are cut thin making them tender and easy to chew but they are just way too salty and definitely not worth ,over priced sticks of salt , delicious
i read the reviews and thought i like salt i thought the saltiness was on the exterior of the jerky there is very little salt taste on the outside of the jerky but the saltiness comes out with every chew the strips are about the size of a or a very thin ounces for is way too expensive there is very little beef flavor but too be fair it is probably covered up by the salt these taste very similar to the chopped and formed cheap jerky at the convenience mart that you swear you will never buy again but much more salty the amount of salt made my tongue if you want good jerky keep looking jack link smokehouse beef jerky strips wood smoked count jar ,way too salty , not as good as it is
the jack link jerky strips were skinny some were only about inch wide and counted as one strip if i had known this i would not have ordered the beef jerky strips tasty but totally not worth the money ,very misleading , good
too salty enough said i order the wood smoked count jar remember the price is for only one jar not two ,too salty , delicious
was hoping that the pieces would be a bit in but they shy away from sausage stick fine enough flavor was not bad but nothing to write home about i am just glad they were not that greasy ,thought they would be a bit , not as good as it is
i like almost everything about this jerky the and but it is just too salty if you nibble it you may enjoy it but that is not how i eat also it is not good for my health to eat something this salty i have run into too many of salty beef jerky recently this review is for the wood smoked but if other flavors contains the same amount of salt per serving they will be just as salty why everything is either too fatty sweet or salty are they trying to get us addicted ,too salty , not as good as i like
i buy jerky all the time always willing to try something new i have even made my own at home i agree with the review that called these salt sticks they are way too salty for my taste also being a jerky eater for years i eat it because i like the and of jerk but the tube i got was nearly un chewable i have bit into some hard jerky in my time but these were literally like chewing many of the strips would not yield to my super powered bite ,maybe i got a bad batch , great taste
this is a good name and a good value the texture and size of the jerky is fine br but be prepared for the salt it ruined it for me ,very salty , good but not great
wow the hickory smoked sticks were incredibly salty i could not even eat half of the stick i have had different people try them and they had the same problem they are so terrible it tastes like you are dumping salt into your mouth avoid these at all costs ,way too salty , the best
first time ordering this jerky from amazon and i highly recommend to everyone do not buy it it is harder than a rock i have bought it from other sellers not amazon and it is much better the date is not for another year but you cannot even bite it or chew it horrible i think its the worst jerky ive ever bought ,hard as a rock , not as good as it is
i do not eat beef jerky and i wanted to buy some for a christmas gift i read all of the reviews at amazon com and decided that jack links would be the best purchase it came nicely packaged but there is liquid in the packaging a lot of it if you turn the packaging upside down the movement of the liquid is obvious so now i have to pay to return beef jerky and buy a different type br br three days since my original review amazon cannot accept returns of food items so it replaced the beef jerky the replacement also has liquid in it it is not fat but a liquid as described above this time i am asking for a refund ,i did not know beef jerky was to be , not as good as it is
i buy jack links peppered jerky every month i tried these as this was the first time seeing them do not waste your money they are so tough even the kids eat them they do not taste anything like the other peppered stick with the oz or the oz sticks they are moist and not so much ,do not waste your money , great taste
this is the worst jerky i have ever tasted it is not edible i actually gave it to my dog and he spit it out i kid you not do not buy this product unless you are a bar owner and want your customers to beers to put out the salty fire that is created when you eat a small bite of this crap i deserve a refund for buying this dog food oh excuse me i forgot even my dog will not eat it ,wish i could give it a , my dog loves it
i did not realize when i decided to purchase these that they were boxed and because of that i found them stale and hard i had previously purchased these at a local store who packaged them in plastic and they were soft and fresh sorry that i could not give these a better review ,sorry , not as good as
this is the only food my cat will eat if i buy another variety or brand it sits in her bowl until it gets stale i throw it out ,great product , great cat food
this flavor of fancy feast is the favorite of our of a cat she is usually a very picky eater but this flavor really gets her excited br br the local store ran out of this flavor and may not restock it so i ordered online we got a good price and the case of food arrived in good condition br br i was a little confused by the old label image that was on the web site that is just different enough from the new label that i had to double check that i was getting the item that i was expecting br br it turned out to be the correct item so all was well ,our eater favorite food , great product
i honestly cannot say that i saw any difference whatsoever in this variety compared to friskies regular sliced beef version actually my cat preferred the regular friskies over this one he is not really all that jazzed over these fancy feast varieties anyway so if you are going to buy this one or the chicken save your money and buy the regular friskies versions they seem to taste better to the cat and it saves you money i have never had a cat that ever got too thrilled over this variety over the years so i guess i will get the special ones instead ,not any different than regular , cat cat food
i think lives does a better job on this variety than friskies or i should say my cat does friskies does not look as fresh or as appetizing as lives and my cat does not like it as well it just smells nasty and looks not quite as good as the lives i think they could definitely do better on this variety maybe even add cheese to it my cat leaves this one in the dish but eats the lives version ,not their best , cat grass
this version is ground not my current cat favorite version but he really likes the taste i do wish they would make this one not ground but in the pieces variety too my previous cat really liked this one and usually licked the bowl clean but neither wanted it more than once or twice a month why i do not know but it seems to be a little richer than the others ,great food , cat grass
according to my cat this stuff is just great he just licks himself for hours after eating this one and just loves the taste he will lick the bowl clean on this one and eats it usually pretty quickly but he still does not want it more than times a month because it is fish not exactly his favorite food it is a great from his regular fare and one that he truly ,great food for all cats , cat loves it
i have not had a cat yet that liked this one it is just a little too interesting for them i think it smells nasty but i think it is just the taste that really gets them my current cat just will not touch it he might eat a couple of bites if he is really hungry but i always wind up throwing it out this one is ground so if your cat likes pieces do not try this one ,needs , cat cat food
i am so glad to shop at amazon com it have everything you need i br love getting my season from creek spices it fresh and br taste and good try it you will like it i am so glad to know about br amazon com i would not know about creek spices br br thank you br miss br god ,very very good , good stuff
i love lemon pepper i was amazed with this one large grain and fresh very large jar that delighted me because i use this in nearly everything good tight jar to keep it fresh very inexpensive good buy for home cooks ,lemon pepper in jars , great product
this says pack so i assumed like other purchases that i made that it was boxes each with packs big mistake you only get four little pouches who would pay over for a little squirt of applesauce do not make the same mistake buy elsewhere ,huge , not as good as it is
this fruit as my daughter calls it is great convenient yummy no added sugar i love it i just do not understand why it is so expensive i find it at the grocery store for for a four pack do not pay this price that is crazy ,love this but what is with the price , great product
this is my cat favorite one he just licks that bowl clean whenever he gets it i usually buy a case of this one at a time and judging from how often it sells out other cats must love it too the cheese are large and look quite tasty it is just a very nice variety and something i am sure every cat loves my previous cat about ran me down whenever i got it out to give to him and my current cat is no different give this one a try you will be glad you did ,awesome food , cat cat food
my cat is so picky i have tried every brand and flavor and this is my cat favorite ,my cat favorite , cat cat food
once or twice a year for a little variety and that is about enough for my cat of this particular variety he likes it for a change from his chicken turkey and beef but not very often he will eat about of the can and then he is had enough he is not a huge fish fan anyway but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties the chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does it will be easier to chew do not know why my cat does not like this type of fish but he really could care less about it ,not the favorite in our house , cat grass
catch sea choice and ocean whitefish with tuna i also serve as a foster parent for the local pet shelter and find that these varieties of food are the best tolerated and completely consumed of all varieties the salmon pate is very rich and i use it only as a special treat incidentally my cats always reach great age on friskies our cat kitten died at years old she jumped off of a high bed and severely her and at the time it happened the vet asked what food we used all of those years it has always been friskies dry and wet pet foods i find it is the best value and maintains our pet good health right to the end the youngest cat that has died in our care was years old and i have have had cats as permanent pets and countless foster pets over the years ,cats love it , cat cats love it
our two cats ate kibble for years but after some serious teeth problems they had to switch to canned food we tried a few different brands and flavors they would eat it for a few days then turn up their noses even expensive food from the vet did not please them br br so we tried the friskies sea choice flavor and they went nuts it down like candy we only bought a few cans at a time figuring they would of it but no they have been eating it with gusto for a of months now so we buy it by the case br br i do not understand about it not smelling good perhaps they got a bad batch but it smells like other cat foods to us and the pate is easy to dish out as long as the cats love it who are we to complain ,our cats love this food , cat food
i honestly have to say that i just will not buy this variety it looks bad smells bad and i am sure tastes bad because my cat will not touch it no way no how will not even look at it my other cat was the same way with this one it just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market i am sure some cats must like it because it is still being made but there is other things out there much much better than this one ,this stuff is bad , not as good as it is
instead of a black cap a top was sent instead not great for a gift also i think any buyer should be aware that by godiva pack they mean pieces of candy very confusing description especially when you consider that the picture shows at least pieces of candy definitely not worth the price ,wrong and misleading , great taste
it because we tested it over a few different days i would not eat the taffy some days and would be fine all it took was a few pieces and an hour late the bubble would start br br this information may be useful since its not on amazon sugar free does not carb free a pound bag is g br br from the manufacturer website br ingredients hydrogenated starch partially hydrogenated soybean and or coconut oil acid combinations for flavor citric acid and or acid egg salt lecithin sucralose natural and artificial flavors combinations of red blue blue yellow yellow br br nutrition facts br serving size g br br amount per serving br calories cal from fat br daily value br total fat g br saturated fat g br trans fat g br cholesterol mg br sodium mg br total carbohydrate g br sugar g br protein g ,taste good but gave me , not as good as i be
i would have given this stars but took one off for the high cost this product otherwise is just yummy this is from the perspective of a diabetic who has not had regular taffy for years but i think this would hold its own next to regular taffy pretty easily br its sweetened with sucralose not maltitol so there is not the worry of upset which is the reason i ordered it i do not see why more companies do not the maltitol and just use other sweetners that have less of an impact on digestion the flavors are full and all different depending on color and yes even the flavor tastes good br its soft and chewy and i feel like i am when i am not at all br i am glad i found this ,a , not as good as it is
i bought this along with the easy freeze ice cube trays for my two dogs my vet put my lab on a diet so i have been looking for low calories treats to feed him for his evening snack each packet is only calories and will fill one easy freeze ice cube tray six large ice cubes for the extra large size one packet will also fill my labs and my terriers kong medium they love it and make sure they lick their kong clean without getting bored with it overall a great snack ,low calorie and my dogs love , my dog loves these
just right for making noodles and other delicious recipes glad to have this in my pantry flavorful vinegar will be useful for various dishes product delivery was great just as expected ,handy for cooking , great product
milder than most but with its own very special taste to add to plum vinegar and cider vinegar for that layer of flavor ,different , not as good as
this is terrific honey what more can one say about it there was a great price when i got it too much better than at the local supermarkets ,delicious honey , delicious
this food variety is ground thus my cat does not care that much for this variety but he liked the taste of it a lot so i have been buying it off and on throughout the years my previous cat really liked it so i have purchased quite a few of these it is got that liver smell to it but they like it so who cares if your cat likes ground give this one a try for sure ,great beef look , my cat loves it
this is my cat third favorite food it is great stuff the gravy is so very thick and the food looks like bits of steak off for your friend my cat licks the bowl clean every time and wants more they should send me discounts for as much of this stuff i buy i buy it by the case if that gives you some idea ,family favorite looks like , cat grass
this is another favorite in our house my cat does not want it more than times a month or so but he still wants it and licks the bowl clean it is fish not his favorite but he really likes his salmon and this one is outstanding it is ground why do not they make a sliced or bits version not his favorite either but he does get it down pretty quickly try this one it is a definite winner ,great food , great food
this one is a great basic food whatever is in it cats really go for and mine is no exception my current cat really does not like the ground variety which is what this is he will eat it occasionally so i only buy it about twice a year my previous cat had to have it more often and really enjoyed it it is hard to judge what a cat will eat so if your cat likes ground give this one a go because it really seems to be a big favorite ,what is in this , cat cat cat food
taste amazing the honey flavor goes well with the smoked barbeque taste it is soft but not too soft it also has a nice tang and spice to it but nothing too extreme br smell as soon as i opened it everyone in my section ran up to see what the smell was i would describe it as and not overpowering or off putting br price for a pound of this quality of jerky i would expect it would cost more needless to say you get more bang for your buck br br in short if you want a good jerky to snack on you cannot go wrong with this selection do your tastebuds a favor and get this jerky ,high quality jerky , not as good as it is
delicious pretty good stuff its sweet and not like chewing on like some products i have tried worth the money and for people who dont like crazy hot jerky but still like a little bite this is for you ,honey bbq delight , delicious
this jerky is flavorful and tender can t ask for much more the only problem i have with it is that it does not last long enough around my house ,great jerky , great product
i bought this product because it looked good not knowing if it would taste as good as it looked well it finally showed up by usps well packaged it is soft smells great and tastes even better you will not be disappointed i have already eaten five strips ,looks good and tastes good , not as good as it is
this is the absolute and complete best beef jerky that i have ever had you will be hard pressed to find better if you can it is tender and has a good bite but at the same time you will not rip your teeth out either it is also not too salty ,awesome , great taste
i have been trying different beef and by far i find this product to be the best tasting nice meaty chunks and very flavorful ,best beef jerky so far , best ever
i am always on the lookout for good old fashioned candy funny i do not even have a sweet tooth however i really appreciate a quality candy i picked up one these purely for the fantastic packing they come in after just one taste it was obvious that the company has put love and care into producing these candies if you are looking for unique smooth and delicious old fashion candy look no further highly recommended ,absolutely one of the best hard available , great product
if you like a lot of flavor in each bite this is it a little messy to handle but worth the fuss ,very , not as good as
i absolutely loved newman own pretzels with the pepper baked right into the pretzel for just a little bite these are not as tasty and yes they are messy and overly seasoned not really a fan of this line of flavored broken pretzel pieces although this was a little better than some of their other flavors br br someone out there needs to try making the baked in black pepper version again please not sure why newman own stopped ,it is been better , not as good as it is
it is difficult to describe herbal type pills with no quick results it takes blind really i these are ok i got what i ordered quickly ,quick delivery , good but not great
this tea is full of flavor without bitterness no additions needed you will not be disappointed do not try this earl grey if you do not like bergamot ,earl grey tea , not as good as it is
i ordered this for my daughter who does not like coffee she says it is the best tasting tea and it brews perfectly with the keurig also like the large quantity box ,great tea , great tea
it is made in new zealand it is now made in the us by performance pet products i have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall of and prior to the change it was excellent food and i was thrilled with it since has been switched to canning in the us it has been a several times in the last year i have opened the food to find it is a green or blue i had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools also recently i have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of pink material that looks like i have contacted the us distributor twice but they have never a batch i got this month with an date of has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy ,is made in the us problems , food is the best cat food
this is the best cat food i introduced it to my yr old cat slowly and she is much healthier has a coat and less each time i purchase i switch up the flavors cats love variety br great product ,awesome cat food , cat grass
my two cats refused almost a dozen canned foods but this they could not get enough of thank you a superb supplement to their dry food diet ,at last a canned food they will eat , cat food
just like anything else from new zealand this food is amazing my cat cannot wait for it and plate is always clean she loves it and i feel great buying they even put green muscles in this food overall food looks solid packed with proteins and kiwi love ,love for cats , my cats love it
we all know how picky cats can be it may be grain free but food still smells looks like and fine details in label indicate highly processed with all the extra vitamins minerals which i think is the for the kitties does not say up front but also contains new zealand green which i am not sure how that ingredient fits in as i am not from new zealand but suspect rely on that for nutrients as we do in this country they are spoiled on the real thing processed or raw rabbit chicken bird wild caught salmon they will eat canned only if processed another cat food bites the dust but gives the dogs another treat star for not knowing about the new zealand for still being highly processed therefore unpalatable as food for cats that love rabbit star for a dog treat without the added hormones grains etc ,cat will touch it but dogs go wild star for dog food treat , cat and not as good as it is
my cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money it is just sitting in our i will donate it to a shelter ,my cats would not eat it , cat grass
years and love them i thought i would be smart and order one pound cakes at once as i know i would use them this time the quality control went out of town lousy absolutely disappointing of the loaves one was good two were so dry they crumbled rather than be cut and i ended up adding them to cake batter in cupcakes or put on ice cream as topping totally unable to slice br br the last two loaves just the opposite they were runny when taken out of the wrapper they just over again had to use as ice cream topping or put into cake batter for cupcakes br br claxton farm might have sold out or fired the quality awful quality after all these years do not order from claxton as you do not know what you will get they lost a long time customer with me ,what happened to quality , great product
in christmas i first ordered fruit cakes they where great nice big cherries and other fruits and nuts these were overloaded with the good stuff that makes a fruit cake really great so i re ordered in christmas of what a disappointment i ordered one pound cakes when my order arrived i was so excited yes i like fruit cake only too be very disappointed not only where the cakes void of very much fruit unless you want too count the as fruit i will not be ordering fruit cakes next year i can get the same results from a hostess fruit cake and only spend instead of close to dollars for the cakes ,not like the good days , good but not great
i have a friend from england who adores fruitcake for her birthday i sent her a package of fruitcake she fruitcake in june is so decadent she loves claxton fruitcake so this was a no brainer now i want some too ,in , great product
the ingredients i noticed that corn syrup sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the th ingredient at the very end were listed molasses spices and artificial food high fructose corn syrup was not widely available until the mid to mid so i am not sure how it was one of the original ingredients br br all of the people i talked to seemed to have the attitude that i was so stupid that i could not possibly be what i had correctly although they offered to send if i returned it at my own expense they told me that what i would receive would be identical to what i have one of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year br br i am the loss of an almost year tradition but the other cakes are now in the trash ,very disappointed , not as good as it is
this is amazing chocolate for most baking in general is wonderful fruity and deep in taste but the in the kg package melt super easily the package is resealable and you can keep it in the fridge ,amazing cooking chocolate , great product
never gave much thought to this treat until came to town awesome have a big ole candy dispenser at work with a big sticker on it now we have cajun style ,helps me get into go , great taste
i have always always loved skittles they are sweet and chewy and they will give you plenty of if you are not careful br br enjoy them and buy this lb bag today br br stars ,yum , delicious
my title was my reaction when i first opened the box it came in i did not really plan on eating the whole bag since they are mostly gonna be used as to get my kids trained my two year old girl does not really care so much but they work wonders for my four year old with autism i give her one after she and her hands and she could not be happier i do find myself reaching in and getting handfuls at times but i try not to go if you love skittles than this bag will probably be good for you but if you are just a casual candy eater than maybe not ,that is a lot of candy , not as good as i be
the package arrived days earlier then it said it would and they were very fresh they were also cheaper then the candy some of the candy had melted together but it was only maybe pieces per bag overall really good ,its fresh and really good , good
to me what also got me hooked is this kid i remember from th grade science class who would always bring in a bag of skittles every single day and chew on them and all the girls liked him because of his good looks and smooth personality so skittles sort of gave me the impression that cool kids eat skittles however please buy bags of skittles from your local grocery store it is not worth it here on amazon with the high dollar price you can find plenty of places in your area selling them for cheaper prices my only complaint with skittles is that despite the color they all taste exactly the same to me purple green red orange yellow i really cannot taste a difference between these supposed different flavors then again i do not have a favorite color in a rainbow so maybe this makes perfect sense ,skittles are tasty , good but not great
i just love skittles for a while we had them here in brazil south america but then for some reason i could not find them anymore so when my aunt is coming down for a visit i ask her to bring me some this time i decided to spare her the shopping trouble and i bought it through amazon and had it sent to her place the bag was a bit larger than i expected but i guess this was a good thing right ,taste , great taste
aweful they arrived immediately and still were as hard as the bags supposed re zipper didn t re seal once and maybe the large amount had something to do with it but again i cannot believe how stale and terrible the candy inside was ,oz bag of skittles , not as good as it is
so this bag of skittles is really worth it comes with a load of skittles filled too the top of the bag skittles is my favorite candy now i order the lb all the time its enough to share and still have a lot left over ,love skittles this bag was full , good but not great
there is not much to say other than the delivery was great and the candy was fresh and chewy eating alone the bag lasted me months great for the price and i would order again ,first time buying candy over the , great product
i ordered these because i couldnt seem to find this size at the store there were a couple shells at the bottom of the bag from the shipping of the product but everything else was fine ,tastes like skittles to me , good
skittles are a great candy but for this product i would say do not buy it here i have seen this same bag for on sale and not on sale for at some big chain stores the candies themselves are fine and if you are thinking of getting a big bag you know what they taste like just do not to get a big bag price wise might be cheaper to buy a bunch of little bags ,price is high skittles are skittles , great taste
the add on program makes this a great deal for a natural very tasty sugar br br you can add to any order over or buy like i did and have all delivered free either way an outstanding value br br there are lots of good reasons to eat natural sugar i use in my coffee and making bread use to instead of white sugar for your needs you may find that will proof faster and more bubbly with this type of organic sugar br br the zip bag does not seal all that well so i store in a quart jar in the dark cupboard each bag is more than one quart the balance is added to the sugar bowl br br give this sugar a try hope you enjoy it as much as i do ,much better deal , great taste
get this type of sugar any other way than through ordering it because the shipping is insane the sugar is fine but for the price of the shipping it was not worth it ,only if you can t , great taste
i buy syrups to make soda with plain seltzer water and this one is by far the absolute most delicious one i have found this particular flavor is incredibly true to a real red grapefruit flavor yet sweet and powerful what is great is that the flavor works whether i want just a little or a lot depending on how sweet i want my soda to be on any given day it is comparable to squirt fresca but honestly i think the actual flavor is much richer and more satisfying if you like the taste of grapefruit even a little bit you will not be disappointed ,absolutely scrumptious , great product
the harder to find goat milk versions of cheeses made from cow milk such as the goat milk cheddar and br br as for as price goes this is a surprisingly good value you are getting two pounds of very expensive chesses for a little more than i have paid for one pound of some of the varieties here one of my friends did receive a substitution for one of the chesses instead of the cheddar they received the grove midnight moon i can certainly understand why substitutions would be necessary and i felt that they replaced the listed cheese with an even better variety overall i am very pleased with both the price and the quality of the cheeses i just wish that they had less fresh and more unique forms of this wonderful type of br br a href http www amazon com gp product goat cheese a ,a good of goat but not great , good but not great
ordered this goat cheese and it is just fantastic i cannot digest cow milk so finding these goat cheeses was a great treat i would order them again they are that delicious looks spectacular on a cheese with fruit and crackers ,wonderful cheese , great for
mine came with a wine soaked variety thats purple i have not tried yet the cheddar is delicious and melts smoothly actually has bits in it very nutty earthy soooo tasty my favorite so far and the de chevre mmm runny creamy delicious i have never been disappointed by any of the cheese selections even if its different than pictured this is no different ,delicious selection , delicious
this soup is like a combination of vegetable lentil and spanish rice soups it has a slightly texture though i never add as much water as i should stars to be exact ,and better than i expected , not as good as it is
tried this in a turkey burger and it was sooo good i definitely recommend free salt can be added or better yet add a sprinkle of goya ,yummy , delicious
it would not be very smart to replace real veggies with these veggies straws but if you want a healthier salty snack i personally cannot think of a better one on the market the portion size for calories is absolutely one portion is equal to straws that is quite a bit of snacking for calories these are crispy and taste great there is no trans fat no preservatives and kosher certified the single serving does have grams of total fat and carbs eating these all the time might not be great for your diet but when you want something this is fantastic option i have lost lbs in the last year and half by following a sensible diet and i am happy to say this brand of veggie straws has helped me along the way ,not real but a really good better than chips snack , not as good as i be
quick read of the back of the bag they are made primarily of potatoes and flavored with tomato and spinach this why they taste so much like potato chips the texture is light and crisp and while it is been many years since i have had pork rinds that is what i think of when i bite into these straws br br sensible portions is the name of the company a ounce bag contains servings which is about straws each serving has grams of fat compare that to a href http www amazon com gp product b frito lay baked ruffles original potato crisps a which contains only grams of fat per ounce serving br br if you can overlook the fat content veggie straws are actually quite tasty and they do have that edge with that name i feel like i am eating healthier even when i am not ,good flavor a little misleading , not as good as i like the
my kitties love these other treats are good kitties adore these beg and for them i think they must be addictive for cats ,best kitty cookies ever , great product
chicken since it is not real meat cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it is cheap but it is not real meat a little further down you will notice an artificial preservative which again real premium dog foods do not have br br in short is a joke it is basically insanely overpriced alpo with no organic ingredients whatsoever and uses all the filler and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use do not be fooled by the old fashioned appeal of the company years in business there is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag and all the appeal will not make up for cheap lousy ingredients calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a a for nearly the same price as this overpriced alpo one could buy organic dog food free of preservatives corn and cheap by products ,a big , great product
my dog is years old and his breed chinese is very subject to gum disease and tooth loss after the last visit to the vet with surgery that cost of his teeth i have struggled to find him a food that he could eat that he liked and would maintain his weight his energy level very pooch and be good for him he does not like soft food so it is been a real task br br this food does it it is not brittle or it is shaped like almost like rabbit food and breaks really easy it is tasty cause he it right up and he also has managed to get some weight on him he looks better than ever before i can at last rest easy knowing he is getting a decent nutritious food ,great food for dogs , my dog loves them
i have a year old chihuahua who is missing half his teeth he has always been a dry dog food who enjoyed picking out a piece or two of kibble and taking his time playing with it a while before he ate it but he got where he could not chew the dry kibble and for many reasons the canned wet dog food was not working out this senior proved to be the answer he is able to have the comfort of food in his bowl all day like he is used to and he can actually eat it when he is hungry i am grateful for this product because we are both old dogs who are pretty set in our ways ,works well with my old dog , my dog loves them
both of our dogs are fed my older dog dixie loves this senior version it is nutritionally dense with meat as it is primary ingredient and without empty fillers and fats dixie weight is easier to maintain with this formula and she has the most marvelous shiny coat too ,hands down , great product
i have to add that i have not baked with this yet but when i received this i was at the ingredients perhaps i did not read it well because the ingredient list is right there i guess i simply expected alcohol vanilla beans maybe sugar in an ol product br br i ll update this once i use it ,i am , not as good as it is
i have had the other nana no gluten cookie bars in berry vanilla and they are not that good but the chocolate munch flavor is good they are more moist have a good flavor and a little crunch the only reason i am giving it four stars instead of five is that the texture is a little bit crumbly i will be buying these again ,very good , not as good as it is
i agree with everything that the previous reviewer wrote in their review i gave the cookies a rating of stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about years without getting sick this is because i have severe allergies to wheat and soy pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants so when i found nana cookies i was as happy as can be yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it is better than going without cookies it also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious if you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are a very welcome addition to that diet ,from a with a very diet , good but not great
i am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten free diet for over six years and was excited to learn about this product after eating it the taste and texture was not bad i became sick in the way that i always do when ingesting gluten nana also makes non gluten products and clearly are not careful about cross contamination if you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet i strongly recommend you avoid this product i also think that the company should not their customers many who suffer from celiac disease and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product ,not a gluten free product , great product
i actually tasted the berry vanilla flavor if you have ever eaten a fig newton then try to imagine a fig newton minus the fig center with rice mixed up in it it tastes a little grainy at first but once i read the ingredients and realized that the grains were puffed rice i was more at ease really a good taste one of the better gluten free free egg free cookies i have eaten ,good taste but texture a little getting used to , not as good as it is
the flavor is decent berry vanilla but i just cannot handle the texture it is like a mouthful of that just when you bite into it i have been gluten free for about years and there are much better products out there my kids will not even eat these ,yuck , not as good as
like other reviewers i rarely eat cookies because i have an response to wheat gluten therefore i generally love any cookies i am not allergic to these are an exception the taste is mild and the texture is like sand and leaves a dry feeling in your mouth the only purpose these cookies are good for is dieting because they are simply inedible blah ,a gluten free , delicious
i have to disagree with the other review here i love the little bits of crunch in these otherwise really soft cookies i love the banana taste and i love these cookies it is so nice to have a a gluten free cookie option that does not suck i totally recommend these ,i love these , delicious
my daughter who is type diabetic and has celiac loves these cookies have had a hard time finding them in the local health food stores so was so happy to discover them on amazon so bought cases of them so now there is enough for the whole family ,great gluten free cookies , great snack
these are sort of like brownies a little soft a little dry my year old really likes them they are good if you are on a restricted diet but otherwise nothing too special ,not too bad , not as good as
i have a year old and a year old that love these the best thing is that they are healthy they are vegan so no dairy eggs or other animal products they are also fruit juice sweetened and made with whole grains absolutely nothing artifical they have little chocolate chips in them and taste yummy i am so glad that amazon carries them because they are much cheaper to buy by the case then at local health food stores or through the company website ,my love these , great taste
i love the other nana cookie bars and cookies so i thought i would give these a try even though they are no gluten and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour they look nice but the texture is a bit strange it kind of like eating really fine sand and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch they do not taste bad which is a plus but i will not be buying these again ,weird texture too dry and , great taste but not as good as you are
i purchased these because they do not contain dairy soy or corn well in addition to being dairy free soy free they are flavor free absolutely horrible dry tasting bars first words out of my mouth were tastes like dirt so that is what i am going with do not waste your money ,taste like , good but not great
these are so gross i cannot believe i wasted my money on them they gave me an immediate migraine from the overwhelming artificial smelling fragrance i am not that picky an eater and i generally love any gf cookie just b c i am so grateful they exist but omg i immediately spit this out and out my mouth even my snack loving toddler did not like these eating them that is she did have a great time it into a fine powder which takes almost no effort at all what a mess and what a waste of money ,disgusting gave me an instant , good but not great
i crave these day and night best cookie brownie bar i have ever tasted not too headache y sweet but a rich cocoa flavor with a really great texture they hit the spot wish they were at more grocery stores ,best cookie bar ever , delicious
i have a yr old w food allergies and both he and my yr old love these i have compared to several other cookie snack items made with no dairy eggs and i think we all liked these the best definitely a must have for restricted diets ,great for diets kids like , my dog loves these
i love love love these cookie bars i cannot have any sugar or any gluten and happened upon these at whole foods what a saving grace the big cookies are also excellent but i would eat the whole big cookie at one time these little bars are perfect ,finally something for those of us on diets , great taste
i have celiac disease and i try to keep the refined sugar to a minimum and i was suprised by how good these are the light crunch is a shock at first but is tasty it is a tad dry so i am only giving stars but the taste is great considering how healthy it is ,great for gluten free and no white sugar , not as good as it is
my kids love these and i feel good about giving them to them they are all natural and sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar we like to pop them in the microwave for about seconds then they taste like fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookies yum ,so good and good for you too , great taste
my year old son was just diagnosed with allergies to wheat egg and milk i was so upset when i found out but a little relieved as i started finding foods he can eat yes they are crumbly but they taste good my kids like them and they meet his new dietary restrictions since the option is not giving a year old cookies i do not mind some crumbs ,great for those on a diet , great for
we have a gluten free household of no one in our family likes these my children are begging me to throw the box away i think they are afraid i will sneak one in their the cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and chewy fruity bits in your mouth have a glass of water nearby if you try these i hate to leave a bad review but there are way better gluten free options out there br br i will not throw the box away i will pass it on to another gluten free family i know and let them form their own opinion ,just terrible , not as good as i be
i was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of nana chocolate munch cookie bars to me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder cannot even cover up i threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar ,i them away , not as good as it is
nana cookies are good eaten plain they are a bit crumbly compared to cookies made with wheat flour br br the cookies are individually packaged i find it better to cut the plastic open with scissors to avoid breaking the cookies br br if you want the cookies crumbled just break them up in the packaging and then cut open with scissors to neatly br br i like to cut up strawberries and crumble a nana cookie over them with a little whipped cream it is just like a good strawberry shortcake they are great crumbled over bananas too br br despite being somewhat fragile nana cookies from amazon usually arrive intact ,makes a nice gluten free , good but not great
treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar br br at only calories grams of fat and grams of sugar natural fruit sugar the nana banana flavor of cookie bars makes a great treat for kids and adults the amount of banana is just right and you even get a few tiny bits of crunchy banana inside br br each cookie measures approximately inches long by inches wide perfect for a light snack or dessert especially for kids amazon has the best price around on nana cookie bars so rest assured that you are getting a good deal even though they are pricier than regular cookies made with corn syrup and sugar br br good cookies are not cheap and cheap cookies are not good give nana banana cookies a try no i do not work for nana but am a happy loyal customer ,banana a delicious gluten free treat for kids or , a great snack for your
my year old eats the chocolate munch cookie and loves them i bought them not because they were gluten free but because they are sweetener free he calls them chocolate treat if that gives you any indication of how good he thinks they are i would definitely recommend this flavor to everyone i have found that with the subscribe and save discount i can get the boxes cheaper on amazon than in stores like sunflower sprouts and whole foods ,a chocolate treat , great for
it is close to impossible to find a cookie that is both soy free wheat free and the only sugar that is used is from natural juices apple etc that is the only reason i gave the cookie such a high br as for taste the chocolate flavor is pronounced i enjoy the crunch however the texture of the cookie has a lot to be desired the cookie needs to either be crunchier or more moist as is it wants to stick to the roof of your mouth and is just odd making it unappealing if i had tasted the item prior to ordering i would not have bought a whole box full ,disappointed in texture , not as good as it is
i have enjoyed this product for quite some time however i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps at per case customers are paying more than per box for small cookie bars ridiculous i will find a healthier more reasonably priced snack to munch on shame on nana and amazon ,price keeps , good but not great
these cookie bars are great for packing in a lunch or having alone for a snack try all the flavors for a variety ,great gluten free snack , great snack
i love these banana cookies even though i can eat any other brand ingredient yes the texture is different but that is what i really like about them it kind of reminds me of mexican wedding cookies dry melt in your mouth texture they are really expensive compared to name store brand cookies so i have to maintain my self control and eat only one every few days ,i do not have any food allergies , great snack
i tried the nana bananas cookie bars for the first time this week i love them i do not have any gluten issues so i cannot speak for that but i really enjoyed the real banana taste of these cookies some people complained about the drier texture which i will admit is a little different than an actual cookie but it i always have it with something to drink anyway so the drier texture is not a problem for me the cookies are nice and soft and there are little delicious crunchy bits in the mix i bring them to work for a nice afternoon snack i will definitely be buying them again soon ,great snack for on the go , great product
my daughter is very picky but she like this cookie very much i have not seen any product this good great product ,best cookie , great taste
my yr old daughter with autism loves these she is on a special gluten free casein free and soy free diet and these are a wonderful snack for her ,great for diet , great for
my year old daughter has celiac disease and these are one of her favorite cookies other than the ones i make they are a great quick snack for her to bring and have on hand so that she does not feel left out or deprived when cookies are offered to kids in social situations ,great snack , great snack
these are the best what a wonderful way to provide a treat for yourself and your kids knowing how healthy and pure they are the taste is and satisfies that sweet tooth highly recommend that you try these ,love no no , great snack
tastes like dry brownie w pieces of puffed rice which get stuck in your teeth come on we can do better than this for cookie bars ,too dry , great taste
it is crunchy i am now love the smoother nana like a href http www amazon com gp product b c nana no gluten lemon cookie ounce cookies pack of a or a href http www amazon com gp product b m nana no gluten chocolate cookie ounces pack of a you get the idea i hope br i do not have coffee or chocolate anymore br if you do not have a problem great but i found out i do ,do not do the bars , good but not great
very tasty and the perfect size snack reliable in availability and shipping time ,delish , delicious
these were good for a snack but found it a little expensive for the size they come in ,these were good but small , good
the berry vanilla is one of my favorite from nana i also like the chocolate munch when i am wanting something with a chocolate flavor they are dry crumble that does not bother me i have been gluten free for five years and have tried near everything nana has become part of my weekly grocery list they are easy to take on the go i think these would be great for parents with allergic children because they are packaged for on the go it can be frustrating to be out and you suddenly get hungry and there is nothing gluten free to be found ,one of my favorites , great for
our family has members who keep kosher who are vegetarians who are unable to eat gluten etc this cookie covers all the but tends to be soft and not entirely tasty however they can be used to make a gluten free pie crust which is a great feature i have the feeling that if they were baked a little longer they would be better br br really though how good can a gluten free cookie be ,tasty gluten free , great product
since i cannot eat sugar and there are so few healthy options out there this is perfect for my chocolate fix ,with milk always good , great taste
our daughter has several food allergies so nana chocolate munch cookie bars are perfect out of all the gluten free cookies out there my daughter just loves nana no eggs no dairy no refined sugar no hydrogenated oils no cholesterol no casein no soy no corn they are made from natural ingredients and sweetened with fruit juice br br now do not get me wrong for the average person these do not taste like a regular cookie i do not personally like the texture but the chocolate flavor is good i will say that this is a wonderful product for people with food allergies but not someone who can have regular cookies ,our daughter loves these cookie bars , great product
this product is definitely not as good as some other gluten free cookies try pamela ,cookies , great product
we have a two and four year old and they enjoy these cookies br good tasting br very convenient packaging individually wrapped great for stuffing in compartment for emergencies br br the right size for our kids br no bad stuff br no complaints ,great snack for , great snack
these cookie bars are and yummy and tasty and healthy and br so good i am a big fan of these when i order a case of these i always think man that is a lot of cookie bars i am probably not going to be able to finish them all probably being the word well low and behold with the help of my husband and year old daughter they are gone quickly and we are ordering more if you are adding more whole wheat to your diet these work if you are looking to get rid of refined sugar in your diet these work if you order them and do not like them you must have been one of those really picky kids that grew up to be a picky adult they are fabulous to eat them is to love them ,so yummy , good for you
my year old son has numerous allergies plus autism and these cookie bars are a life saver they are made with fruit juice as opposed to cane sugar so i do not feel bad about giving them to him we have tried many gluten free cookies these are by far his favorites unfortunately the local stores do not keep them well stocked so i am glad i found them here if you are not used to gluten free products you probably will not like them the texture is very different than wheat but if you have not had wheat in quite a while these are very tasty and not as crumbly as other gluten free products they are fabulous cookies and i am so glad nana makes them don t ever stop ,my son loves these cookie bars , not as good as i be
not like these cookies because they do have a very healthy taste and some might object to the texture of the berry crystals i happen to like the berry crystals and it is nice to eat a cookie that you do not have to feel dietary guilt over a great hearty cookie that goes well with coffee or tea also i am gluten intolerant and have never had any negative reaction to these cookies whatsoever in my opinion a good product however because it is natural and does not have preservatives the faster the item is shipped to you after packaging the better i have noticed that nana cookies do become more dry the longer you keep them around even sealed probably a good idea to try this product before buying a case of it because i have noticed that people either seem to love or hate the nana cookies ,cookies you do not have to feel about eating , good but not as good as you are
i love nana gf lemon cookies so i figured i would try these berry vanilla bars too they are a nice soft texture but i am not crazy about the taste i feel strange about the berry flavoring in a cookie with no real berries just little dried crunchies in the cookie i think i will try the chocolate bars next time around ,good but not the best of the , great taste
i know what you are probably thinking they are vegan they are gluten free they re a dream come true the taste of these bars is very banana y br but i doubt you will be able to the texture long enough to enjoy that the texture is akin to eating a handful of dirt i m no dirt eating pro but when i was trying to chew that is all i kept thinking please if you are thinking about trying these go down to your local natural foods market and pick up a box there first while you are at it you may want to get some of your favorite and lots of it br br ps br if you are in the market for a yummy vegan bar try the betty brand the strawberry is super good ,do not do it , not as good as i be
they are fabulous and not bad for you what else could you ask for ,love it , good
they taste great and are healthy we keep our home stocked with nana cookie bars ,my love these , great snack
eggs it was quite an fortunately we found nana bars fairly soon after their the kids think they are delicious and i love them as a parent because they are a bit healthier than most treats they are also conveniently packaged so that if we go to a birthday party the kids can just grab a bar and take it with them so they are not left out when cake is served i give a package to their too at the beginning of the year so that if there are any special at school my kids still get their treat the fact that my kids consider them a special treat they must really be yummy although i have yet to try them myself btw we tried a few other flavors of nana bars and cookies but this one is the only one my kids like or should i say love ,my kids love them , great for a great price

be careful even though this is listed under gluten free section it is not gluten free ,not gluten free , great taste
symptoms mean somehow this product is contaminated with gluten it is not gluten free please spare yourself the pain and suffering these cookies are not worth it br br for those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free please keep these facts in mind br if you eat gluten it your intestinal lining br if you keep on eating gluten the damage to your will get worse and so will your symptoms br if you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in increase your risk for intestinal cancer and lead to all sorts of problems including br in other words on your diet is not worth it br don t eat nana products br br instead i suggest you buy something like pamela chunky chocolate cookies they are one of my favorites ,not gluten free , not as good as i be
the most awesome cookies on the planet we need a treat that is not full of sugar and fits the bill for us ,cookies , great snack
i was a bit disappointed in these they crumble very easily and have an unusual texture my son does not like them ,not what i expected , not as good as
in the past i have purchased these cookie bars through amazon and have had good business however amazon has not kept up with the ingredients changing in these cookie bars it is very important to me what ingredients are in the foods i purchase i am not happy with amazon business this time ingredients change often amazon needs to keep up to date with the ingredients if they are going to have them listed on their website ,ingredients are not up to date , not as good as the
i do not think i have ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars ever in my life they taste okay but i just cannot choke them down even with coffee ,dry as a , not as good as
i love it it is strong enough to start at least gallons of wine yet light enough to be flexible very important for the lid down inside for a solution future models should come with so you know how much liquid is inside but that was easy to overcome with a and a measuring container ,plastic , great product
this device lid does not seal i am not sure why it is being sold as anything other than a did work well for beer as long as it was to a right at the end of fermentation ,more of a , great product
i got disgusted with the garlic powder sold in bulk at health food stores and natural food groceries it rarely has much garlic flavor and was way too hot and the quality was very at stores that did sometimes sell something good br br i m now half way through my second jar of tone which is consistently excellent it has a strong garlic flavor and is not hot unless you use a lot on something like broccoli it is way better than raw garlic cloves they must have an excellent source of garlic for their powder if you have doubts about your current garlic powder smell it if it does not have a strong garlic smell it is just white powder get this tone and you will get your delicious food back ,the best , not as good as it is
i used to buy this product at the local walmart but they no longer carry it it delivers more garlic flavor per ounce than ordinary garlic powder and i use it whenever fresh garlic is not practical on my burgers in potato salad etc ,much better than garlic powder , good
the garlic granules make cooking with the garlic flavor without adding extra salt the tones quality is exceptional arrived quickly ,garlic , good but not great
my month old daughter has loved this since she tasted it when she was months i have tasted it and it is delicious it is convenient for on the go or to have handy as a snack the ingredients are mangoes and lt organic lemon juice the consistency is nice and thick like that of apple butter so it is not dripping off the spoon also if you feel confident enough you or your child can squeeze it right in his her mouth products are expensive but i think their products are worth it and my daughter has loved every variety we have tried except the pumpkin combo love all the fruits pears apples and these mangoes this also provides of vitamin c ,love love love , great product
my baby loves this it is a great first food to start with when teaching your baby to have solids the pouch makes it easy to get the product out without making a mess and the lid is easy to so you can use it again over a few feeds ,great first food , great product
this is excellent for a baby first taste the pouch size is perfect and it actually lasted me two days as my baby is still just learning to eat solids therefore did not have it all the top makes it easy to so it does not go to waste and can be used again i love the pouch it is easy to get all the product out making a mess ,great first food , great product
this is excellent for a baby first taste the pouch size is perfect and it actually lasted me two days as my baby is still just learning to eat solids therefore did not have it all the top makes it easy to so it does not go to waste and can be used again i love the pouch it is easy to get all the product out making a mess ,great first food , great product
no matter how wholesome a snack may be it is worthless unless the girls approve in this case they both give the science diet jerky treats two paws up i like that beef is the first ingredient in the recipe and there are none of those ingredients created in a science laboratory br br the treats are a nice size and have just enough chew to satisfy for our shih tzu with a few missing teeth i break the treats into smaller pieces so she can manage them br br on the package br use within weeks of opening br satisfaction guaranteed br keep this bag out of the reach of pets and children ,the taste , good for you
first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack to be fair this happens with the of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair by the third and fourth and offerings the hesitation stopped though the girls like these treats now there is not the mad for them like they show for some others or for french fries br br i like that the first ingredient of these snacks is not the undesirable artificial beef and they are made with natural ingredients the treats are small and chewy and are good for training rewarding and for most dogs the consistency is probably perfect just enough chew to add interest for our shih tzu with a few missing teeth i break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left br br science diet these treats with a satisfaction guarantee ,treats , great
i am usually a caffeine guy but i had to switch to decaf while my wife is pregnant this is definitely the best decaf out there full flavored smooth and very aromatic it is the best ,is the best , good coffee
i love community coffee but the batch i received of the special decaf was old the bags had lost their vacuum packed state ,not as good as it is , great coffee

i got this product a while back it was very delicious i love trying to cook korean food i would recommend this product for those who are people new to cooking korean food the hot pepper paste came in perfect condition ,yum , delicious
this is wonderful stuff exactly what i was looking for of all available this one is spicy sweet with a wonderful depth of flavor a good addition to soups stews sauces and marinades occasionally i just eat a spoonful straight from the box it is a good topping for noodles and rice bowls too ,paste , great product
i love all of flavors watermelon is my favorite fruit rolls are more natural than other fruit snacks ,very flavored , delicious
my kids love these fruit roll ups and i remember having them as a child so i was delighted when i saw i could buy a large box however when they came we were disappointed the were were very old and hard we only opened one and it broke into pieces because it is a food item you cannot return which i think is ridiculous we could not even eat them i order lots of stuff from amazon and have had a great experience except for these fruit roll ups do not buy food from amazon the only reason i gave it star is because i had to click on something and they did arrive on time ,old and stale , great taste
these are delicious they have the same consistency as a or and they are sour all the way through i am sure i will be ordering some more ,great hard sour candy , good for you
this candy is similar to the cry baby tears that you find in the boxes only as the seller mentions they are coated which does not seem to bother me one thing you want to keep in mind unlike the individually boxed cry baby tears these ones do not contain the grape flavor great candy it is too bad that this is so hard to find in stores ,baby , great product
the item shipped in an plastic bag within a brown cardboard shipping sleeve arrived with product loose and falling out of the cardboard no effort had been made to seal the plastic bag or the shipping sleeve unbelievable br the product itself is very foul tasting with a horrible lingering aftertaste could be the coating br br i am very disappointed in the purchase and would never buy again especially from this vendor stay away from these ,awful shipping taste , not as good as it is
my wife uses this coffee in our espresso machine to make with cocoa powder and it is great she says it has a nice strong coffee flavor but smooth not bitter i do not drink coffee but i took some to work for the drip machine there and several of the coffee drinkers love it ,works great in my espresso machine , good coffee
our two golden have been on beneful weight control now for at least years we did not see any out of the ordinary problems that others mention they love it and both have lost considerable weight both were considered but now one is normal weight and the other is only slightly overweight my only real complaint is they stopped selling it at least around here in the larger lb bags now you can only find these lb bags but the price is the same we go through about bags a month so it is a little pricey ,great for our dogs , great product
we have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the beneful healthy weight we have noticed very unpleasant results they to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we do not get them outside in time our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to or times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have my is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being by the body which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative i will most likely be going back to purina one ,you want to pick dog off the i do not recommend , my dog loves them
i put all my dogs on this food about a month and a half ago i began to notice my older overweight dog become more and energetic he has already lost some weight also all of the others have more solid stools and they actually enjoy eating this i would recommend this to everyone ,great dog food , my dog loves it
ive noticed that my dog has had more frequent bowel movement than usual he is on a strict schedule for break and has been very good on it for the past years until i tried this food now he poops in my apt in front of us because he has to go so bad like the poster above its one hell of a laxative when my very well trained yorkie cant even hold it in ,dog will eat it but like crazy , my dog loves it
meat by products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested we are talking beaks chicken feet eyeballs even chicken poop i would not recommend this product to anyone for any reason ever it is an absolutely awful dog food i cannot believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising br br i recommend to stay far away from beneful and most purina products when purchasing a dog or cat food the most important thing to consider is the first ingredients just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself now that i know what to look for i usually buy my pets all natural organic foods such as blue buffalo halo or wellness ,false terrible dog food , dog loves it
really loved a different beneful and so i gave this one a try he loves it and is excited when its time to eat he would barely touch purina little bites i took him out of state to my mom place and he in the house times i took the blame for not paying enough attention to him however since we have come back home he is in my apt times in week he never does that i thought that maybe he was being but i really think he just cannot help it the food is one hell of a laxative if thats what you are looking for i am glad i only bought the small bag because i will not be giving this one another try it only gets stars because he likes it and because i am sure he would lose weight if he keeps this much terrible ,dog loves it but it does not love , great product
this is one of my favorite dishes but i always have a tough time finding them in my local supermarkets so like usually i go to amazon and sure enough they are available at a much lower price in a shipment of boxes as i know they will be gone in no time my family loves them too i put them on automatic delivery no more searching the supermarkets love it ,love these , great product
these are very good they are very close to home made but when i am in a hurry i really appreciate having them at hand ,easy sour cream and , good
i was amazed at the actual taste of this product the amount of protein and the lack of fat is really good they have a lot more flavors and all of the combinations are really good ,surprisingly tasty , good but not great
i purchased a keurig so my husband could make just one cup of coffee for breakfast instead of making a french press full and half of it i use it to make unsweetened iced tea with the of sweetened iced tea k cups it is great to have one with the good clean and fresh taste of unsweetened tea i use the largest setting and then add about cup of cold water to the pyrex liquid measuring pitcher with the addition of water it cuts the strength to the proper consistency i do not bother with all the glasses with ice and then brewing over ice i just make the tea and pour it from the pitcher good stuff ,fresh tea on , not as good as i be
this tea makes extremely dark and strong tea on the oz setting which is my largest water setting i use the keurig iced beverage filled with ice and cannot drink it straight my solution is to fill a gallon pitcher with ice add some water make two iced brew k cups and pour it over the ice water for what i consider perfect iced tea you can the water for stronger tea or add more water to dilute the tea depending on your mood or tastes this tea has excellent flavor it is just too strong right out of the keurig for my tastes and in my opinion requires diluting excellent for making a pitcher of tea ,makes strong tea , great tea
great taste there is a slight bitterness to this tea but it is black tea it is bound to be a little bitter especially for being so strong the strength is perfect for to taste some people like strong tea while others like theirs very mild so you can add more water if you want i like to make a fairly strong tea the melting ice it just fine and sweeten it myself i like sweet tea but usually when i get it it just tastes like sugar water these give me the strong tea flavor i love and i can add the perfect amount of sweetness great product ,convenient and tasty too , not as good as i like
this is definitely too strong if you make one glass from one k cup i have experimented now i run two k cups through the large cup brew three times each i add each cup to a pitcher then i add enough water to fill my three quart pitcher i sweeten it with stevia and add juice from one lime great iced tea ,too strong so make more , great taste
great tea i have checked other stores ie target and they are more than this tea costs plus the boxes you get on amazon are bigger ,great tea , great tea
the best tastiest and fast making ice tea by the glass does not leave an after taste like a delicate summer breeze in a glass fresh ice tea anytime of day or night great for company ,perfect ice tea , great tea
i prefer to sweeten my own tea and so this is perfect it makes a strong cup of iced tea and some may choose to add more water after brewing easy to make and great to have around taste is very good ,perfect tea , great tea
i love my keurig and especially like to fix my iced tea with these kcups they are very flavorful and every glass is fresh brewed i drink iced tea all year so i a glad i found an affordable ,love it , great tea
disappointed the big boxes had a very different flavor than the smaller boxes i am not sure why but not good ,different , not as good as
i this product because this tea is really good the shipment came as expected i love the taste of this tea it is not stong at all ,arrived , great tea
i adore these k cups on a diet it can be hard to find pre made drinks that are not loaded with sugar with these guys i can control the sugar content but still enjoy that perfect glass of iced tea ,perfect for on a hot day , great taste
we recently purchased the k cup machine and i was quite excited as i drink iced tea rather than coffee this blend of black tea is quite bitter and not at all what i was looking for it works as advertised just not the right tea for me ,very bitter tea , very good tea
this is a really easy way to make terrible iced tea sometimes convenience taste but not always what this product does not tell you before you buy it is that the ingredients are black tea with tea extract hibiscus and citric acid it is not just tea and it does not taste like just tea either it tastes like powdered iced tea from a jar it has an of lemon that is probably the citric acid and that fake tea flavor that comes from powdered iced tea mix i will probably drink it when it is really convenient but i will not serve it to friends and i will not drink it if i have time to make a glass of real tea and pour it over ice ,this is terrible tea , not as good as i have
this tea is so strong you might as well not waste time brewing and just chew the leaves right out of the container it is strong not in a normal strong tea way instead it is bitter if you use a keurig model that has cup size settings a recommendation is to go with the largest setting for the largest cup you can fit under the keurig and work from there until you get to the taste you prefer also note that while it is in smaller print there is a warning not to use a glass to make the iced tea which is a warning worth paying attention to ,as well it , not as good as i have
i have two chihuahuas and they absolutely love their little bites the ingredients are the best quality available organic chicken flax seed drops and tons of vitamins and minerals the best part about this food is that toy breeds can be on this from the time their little puppies til they are full grown for life try finding another dog food that does that this is a must if you have a toy breed dog it helps balance their glycemic index even at the most periods of time overall it is just a really healthy food that will make your dog look and feel beautiful inside and out ,the best dog food , great product
i ordered this assorted delight in it is delicious i took it to my parents house for my sister birthday among her gifts which i also bought at amazon everyone at the party loved this delight so much they even wanted to buy it for them and i told them amazon go there they have everything amazon thank you as bringing us international flavors without leaving our homes ,the best tasting delight , great taste
although these are a quality dog treat please be aware that these do contain chicken i did not see this ingredient listed on the product page this is just to advise those pet parents if your has a poultry or chicken allergy like mine do that every variety to date contains both chicken and natural chicken flavor br the ingredients are as followed for the low calorie variety br br ingredients br organic brown rice powder rice powder vegetable glycerin gelatin water tapioca starch oat fiber chicken natural chicken flavor dehydrated carrots organic flaxseed cranberries apples cinnamon parsley chia seed carrageenan natural seaweed extract l carnitine peppermint l source of vitamin c green tea extract decaf ,contains chicken , great product
he takes his time on these he did the same with the zukes at first after a few days he seems to really like them br br if you are doing a side by side comparison between the get naked dental chew greenies and zukes i think these are better they are really low in calories and they are wheat free corn free soy free and gluten free they are cheaper than zukes as well br br my recommendation is to cut them in half that will give you treats for your dog per bag three bags will give you treats vs greenies at around the same price he likes the zukes but they are just too expensive seeing how you only get per bag br br i suggest buying one bag to see if your dog likes them if they do then they are a great alternative to greenies ,great alternative , great but not great
my four year old chinese mix loves these dog treats he is somewhat of a picky eater when it comes to dog treats but he loves these they smell nice and minty and take a little while for him to eat so it gives him something to work at they are made with good ingredients no meat or corn and they are made in the usa which is definite plus i will continue to get these for my pup ,my dog loves them , my dog loves these
my dogs really like these my six year old adopted came to us with bad teeth and a weight problem she had teeth pulled and is halfway to her weight goal and has learned to like crunchy snacks br br my ten year old lab likes anything but also needs to watch his teeth and his weight br br i like to give them a treat before i leave the house so that they are happy instead of anxious when they see me get my coat and br br these treats are perfect at only each and the dogs are excited to eat them the lab makes short work of it but the gets to give her remaining teeth a workout ,low calorie and my dog loves them , my dog loves these
my dog has many food allergies but these made in the usa treats are free of wheat corn egg and dairy my dog cannot get enough of them ,my dog loves these healthy treats , my dog loves them
my dogs love these when i ran out of them recently they were counter trying to find some i have a service dog that has to maintain his weight and these are perfect for him ,love these , my dog loves these
my dog really enjoys these and they do not last long she is not a big chewer and does not like bones so i wanted to get something that she could much on from time to time so to help clean her teeth i was attracted to these because they are low calorie and made in the us when you get them out of the package they do not look like food but the dogs do not really mind they are flexible enough to cut in half with kitchen if you have a small dog ,my dog really likes these , my dog loves these
these are great treats my dog is older and has a few extra pounds so i decided to buy these for her she loves them also keeps her occupied for some time while she is eating it ,low calorie sticks , my dog loves these
i have a larger breed of dog about lbs and she loves these at first they seem kind of hard but she has no problem eating them they do not take her very long to finish but they are a nice little snack or treat for her while still being healthy my moms smaller dog about lbs also likes these although the smaller ones are best for her ,my dog loves them , great product
my dogs loves them glad to know that i have found a snack that is appealing to my dog but also something that will not have him breaking the ,my dog loves them , my dog loves these
my dog really enjoys these treats and the plus is that they help keep his teeth clean too will definatly purchase these again ,great dog treat , my dog loves these
i just got these and my dogs love them they smell pretty good and their breath is a little better smelling they are excited when i open the treat jar and they see these yummy treats i like them for the low calorie and better breath ,yummy , great for
not a big fan will not buy this again plus she eats it really quick too other than the throw up part ,my dog up , good stuff
the product was hard as a rock i could not even break it in half both dogs had hard time chewing them puppy could not either will not get product again unless the two packages i got were old and dried out ,bad review , not as good as it is
these dental sticks are perfect for my two dogs that have food allergies and they love them and i like the price for them here at amazon ,get sticks , great for
my dog absolutely loves these i try to give one to him everyday either in the morning or before we go to bed at night it does not take him long to finish it off but long enough to put dishes away or brush my teeth ,great , my dog loves them
my dogs are very tiny and i needed a chew that would have the benefits of teeth cleaning but without any weight gain and these did great plus my dogs enjoyed them if a dog does not like the taste and will not chew on a dental stick then it would the purpose so these fit the bill all around ,nice without added weight , my dog loves them
i was skeptical that my dog would chew on these treats but he does seem to like them they smell like cinnamon and are very low in calories my mini dachshund suffered kidney damage after he is on a special diet of rice and a small amount of protein dogs on these diets often suffer from dental disease i needed something to clean his teeth but also not introduce high protein to his diet these chews are crude protein much lower than other chews and contain fiber chia seeds and flaxseed and like green tea a win win situation for my dog overall health ,my picky eater likes these , my dog loves these
we have a year old pug who will eat just about anything but these unfortunately he just would not go near them no matter how hard we tried to his interest ,not so much , not as good as
i had high hopes for this product because it is healthy and affordable but neither of my chihuahuas liked it one just sniffed at it and walked away the other dog chewed on it for a short while and then walked away from it one dog likes a href http www amazon com gp product b dent original for mini dogs count pouch a and the other dog likes a href http www amazon com gp product b b w n bully sticks free range standard regular thick select inch pack by pet supply a i was looking for some alternatives that were healthy and more affordable i guess i will be sticking with their current treats for now ,dogs did not like it , my dog loves these
these treats are more for a larger dog as they are very hard and thick the girls my maltese like them except way too big and hard to chew for them ,dog treat , my dog loves these
i am a runner doing miles a week and am currently training for the chicago marathon i have tried all of the gels and chews that are out there and these are my favorite i do not like gels as that squirt of mush my gag plus you always need water with them i have tried all of the other brands of energy chews i think sharkies good but sticky and not very tasty shot nice package very sticky on the fingers gu super sticky and caused some nausea gel very good but tough to chew if cold the honey stinger chews are very easy to chew and you do not need water they do not stick to your teeth either the main selling point for me is that they taste good and do not cause nausea no matter what i am sticking with these ones ,the best of the energy , best of the best
they are not as compact as gels like gu but these are great for i empty bags into a small plastic i carry the in a pouch br br i try to eat about chews every miles beginning at mile water to wash them down helps but is not a necessity easy to eat on the run good consistent and natural energy and electrolytes no stomach upset which i always got w gu ,great for , great product
when i am riding and hit the wall where my legs are just out of gas i can eat a pack of these chews and within minutes feel relief and energy i never go on a ride without them oh yeah they taste pretty good too ,honey make the difference , great product
these are best fruit chews i have ever had the flavor and texture is great my son had these last summer for the first time when he was at the boy ranch in new mexico he of course said this as a real treat while he was there i am so glad i found them on amazon well worth the price a great value ,yummy , great product
great seller the product was as described the seller shipped the product quickly good fair price honey stingers are by far the best training race day nutrition you can buy they taste great easy on the stomach and organic i love them ,good stuff , great product
like a lot of folks i t br heard of these before magazine br raved about them in april of br i gave em a try and was blown away br br over the years i have found that i find food br on long less and less appetizing br especially when the temperature is over br the thought of chewing and is br not appealing br br obviously some is still necessary br but i came to and then next the br tastier bars they so i switched to gels br but after awhile i came to those as well br but these little chews are delicious i ll eat them br even when nothing else sounds good br between i keep them out of sight because br otherwise i would snack on them at home br i m on here now ordering another dozen for a big hike ,best thing on the , not bad but not as good as it is
i cannot stand gu anymore so i found these for me i feel like i got much more energy and so much better tasting these taste as good as any gummi candy out there sometimes during the week i will open a package and eat a few every day before my workout and i really notice the extra energy towards the end of the workout ,i use them for , great taste
these are really good also be sure to try the cherry flavor if you can that one tastes absolutely wonderful this does not stick to your teeth at all and it has a very pleasant taste and even smell to it one pack has just enough pieces great to bring along when you are traveling i gave some to a yr old and she loved it because it is not too sweet none of that corn syrup in here people of all ages would easily approve of this i certainly do and would not hesitate to recommend this to everyone ,love these , great product
they have a great fruity flavor they are pretty sweet but you can taste the honey in them and the sweetness doesnt overpower the fruit flavor the texture is perfect not too gummy like gummy bears that you have to chew forever but also not stick to your teeth like sharkies kinda like gum drops and there is lots of them in a bag so you dont feel like you got cheated i think i like these more than any other sports chews i have tried they also dont leave your fingers sticky after handling them i hope they come out with new flavors ,these are great , not as good as i be
these energy chews are absolutely delicious they hold up really well in your pocket or backpack when you are backpacking or mountain i really could not imagine eating any other energy chew ever again ,love these energy , delicious
these honey stingers are great i have used them a handful of times on runs lasting over an hour they do seem to provide some much needed energy they are easy to chew taste great do not stick in my teeth or make me extra thirsty and the packet is small enough to be portable i really like that the ingredients are and healthy enough organic tapioca cane sugar fruit juice etc br br however i do not see how they are any different from organic fruit snacks like annie which i can get much cheaper in a multi pack from my local wholesale club the ingredients and nutrition information are virtually identical for that reason i gave them just stars ,great but special i am not so sure , great product
they taste so good easy on my stomach when i am running help keep my energy up on long runs love them ,so yummy , great taste
these taste good kind of like cherry organic ingredients make it a bit healthier than better than the i say that b c the cola have a medicinal after taste ,tasty treats on the , not as good as
i love these things unlike other products this actually tastes really good i would recommend this to my family and friends ,awesome , great taste
a great pick me up when energy i eat these while honey base is apparent in the after taste but is not over powering the chews are great tasting and provide energy without caffeine ,sweet as honey , great taste
my kids love these they have a great flavor and for us are preferred over sharkies my daughter sometimes gets stomach aches from fruit snacks but has had no trouble with these ,great , great taste
these are a good alternative to candy but still a lot of sugar in a better form br sharkies energy sports chews are not quite so sweet but are healthier the man ingredient is brown rice syrup which is a complex carbohydrate with low glycemic index being very brown rice syrup and agave nectar are the only two natural sweetners that do not cause a sugar crash so for this reason the stingers only get stars and sharkies get if you want sweeter in sharkies get the kids version but they are like stingers no brown rice syrup oh the brown rice version fill me up faster because they are a complex carbohydrate and do not cause blood sugar ,good substitute for candy but are healthier , not as good as the other
we do a lot of riding in the heat and longer rides as well we do not want to crash from lack of carbs in our system other energy products do not taste as good as these do they are conveniently packed in little pouches so they are easy to grab and take along when we ride good stuff ,most awesome tasting energy we have found , great product
i am a huge fan of stinger products however these little gummy gels do nothing as compared to the stinger honey packs if you are a road or mountain and need a good burst of quick energy to keep from on that last hill these will not help in fact the only benefit that i or any of my riding buddies have found is that they make your mouth water this could help with water consumption when riding through the desert it is my guess that these are not intended for exercising maybe people just use them at work to keep from eating or something less healthy ,this if you do not want to , not as good as it is
heard about these from a who said that they worked fast an avid i have used other energy gels with limited success taken about minutes before an they provide the extra boost you need the chews have a great texture and taste like gummi bear candy highly recommended ,good for , good
these taste great and it is true what other reviewers have said about the consistency being good and them not sticking in your teeth however as an energy boost for running they do not do a thing for me in fact they actually cause a so i just eat them whenever i feel i need a sugary fix ,tasty , great taste
i ordered these to use for marathon training i have a sensitive stomach but have had no problems with these they do give me energy during those long runs ,tastes great , great product
these organic energy bites are delicious and work great i use them for golf or long bike rides a few bites every half hour and you will have ample energy for hours of activity ,yummy , great snack
i am not a fan of messy gels or stopping for during a race when i do my own long runs or if i am doing a half mess and factor aside i also do not want to consume junk these are organic and contain honey and while soft squishy somehow do not get stuck to each other when in a gel pocket during a run the taste is so delicious that my son tries to them as well ,not too great for long , good for you
i tasted a few of these and they are pretty good i was expecting something a bit flavorless and i can imagine happily snacking on these for a multi day packing hike i will write more after i have taken them on the trail ,quite tasty , good but not great
tried the pink lemonade flavor today during my long run unbelievably awesome tasted great no stomach issues no sticking to my teeth water not required to wash it down and most importantly it was the best run i have had in a long time cannot wait to try other flavors ,awesome , great stuff
i start popping a package when i can feel that wall coming on these are easy to open while and give a decent boost within a relatively short period of time as always organic is a definite positive not a lot of water is needed to get these down and i have not had any heavy stomach feelings after consuming them very happy with this purchase and will get more when this case is gone ,energy , not as good as it is
i am training for my first marathon in november and these chews have kept me going during my long to mile training runs i dissolve them in water rather than carry them as chews and sip after mile they taste like concentrated hawaiian punch and do not upset my stomach whatsoever i also eat them prior to a workout if i am feeling low energy and will even snack on them in lieu of candy seriously they are that good i have tried gu as well as gels and both do the trick but are nowhere near as tasty the consistency of the chews are slightly softer than dots candy ,great for training , great product
stingers are better tasting and more convenient than gels and work just as well to provide energy when exercising over long periods of time ,best tasting energy boost , delicious
i can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going it is not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going i do not like feeling like i am on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that i think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising the only drawback to me is the cost of these for bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them i will purchase again when my grocery money allows i would recommend to buy if you are looking for a healthy to keep you going all day and not just for a quick boost ,great tasting with help energy up , good but not as good as i like
these energy chews have a great flavor will give you good energy before or during a workout and are a reasonable price i would recommend this to any athlete such as a runner etc strength training and sports nutrition for ,highly recommend this product , great product
i did not want caffeine do not want the high calories went through many types of energy chews gels drinks online to see what would be the best option for myself br br i love the honey stingers no caffeine calories can be controlled depending on how many pieces you take and most importantly it lasted me through my marathon br br fruit is delicious have not tried the other flavors ,great energy tastes delicious no , not as good as it is
i use honey stinger energy chews on all my long distance bike rides i ride over miles a week and love all the different flavors ,great stuff , best ever
last fall i bought a of different protein bar brands to see which i liked the most of the many brands i tried most all were roughly the same in taste texture etc but these honey stingers stood out to me they have a much smoother texture and have a great sweetness to them that really makes them taste great i am a huge fan gonna by a bunch more boxes for snacks and ,sweet and delish , not as good as it is
yo soy y he de es el que me ha ,product , great product
when i opened the package i only found packets of the honey stingers there should have been i counted and re counted times to be sure the packets were in a thin cardboard display box wrapped in a sealed plastic bag and shipped in a sturdy cardboard box i do not really want to go through the hassle of returning the item so i guess i am out a pack it would be nice if amazon shipped me one more packet ,love these but only got of , not as good as it is
these are the most awesome little energy snack possible brought a box of these on a hunt for a week with some buddies for the first time along with a box of sharkies prior to this sharkies where our when needing a boost and energy replacement have to say even the sharkies fan in the group had to admit honey stingers fairly surpassed sharkies in both taste and performance will still probably bring both next time for variety but definitely twice as many honey stingers honey is the perfect food ,honey the perfect natural energy , not as good as i be
if you have been out to on a or as staff these are given to you in your trail meal they are organic and made of honey they good and healthy a ,mmm good , great taste
i had gotten a box of style sauce from my mother and set it aside for a day well today it i mixed the package with water added rice some peppers onion chicken and potatoes and let it simmer my entire family just loved it even my picky grandson now i want to find more ,makes a perfect soup base , best popcorn ever
the box is very impressive so i had high expectations especially when it comes to chocolate br the combination of chopped up nuts and small pieces of dark chocolate is brilliant unlike anything i have tasted before amazing flavor somewhere between velvet chocolate and crispy nuts made me feel almost relaxed br yesterday i had it for breakfast instead of granola with milk it was really good i did not crave food and i did not snack until mid afternoon i am impressed ,better than it looks , not as good as it is
summer drink out of the can that i tried served over ice mixed with soda water it was fantastic the soda water ice mixture helps cut down on the sweetness and improves on the refreshment factor br br a little more about the switch the can claims that this product is carbonated juice with no sugar added and no preservatives one can is fluid ounces and provides calories total sugars per can are g g of carbs one can provides of the daily recommended dose of vitamin c br br that being said i cannot see myself drinking the switch everyday even without preservatives and added sugars this drink still packs in a lot of sugar in every can though to be fair i rarely drink soda or sweetened carbonated beverages still for a nice alternative to the standard soda i recommend the the tangerine flavor is reminiscent of tang ,serve on the rocks , not bad but not as good as it is
for those that want a more natural soft drink this is a good option because it has no added sugars it still manages to pack calories in an oz bottle so do not drink this regularly if you are trying to lose weight the taste has good complexity but like most fruit drinks is a little too sweet for my taste i would definitely drink this instead of a typical artificial orange soda though ,good natural soda , not as good as it is
this sparkling juice drink has a decent and refreshing flavor though somewhat reminiscent of the canned orange juice can t remember the brand i had once in awhile as a kid br br it a nice idea to have a soda that has no added sugar though the juice combination is not as impressive as the name might sound this beverage contains a mix of the following juices reconstituted with sparkling water apple grape tangerine orange and acerola the beverage also includes gum acacia and soy br br despite the fact that there are no added sugars the calorie and carb counts are quite high in fact higher than an average soda an ounce can contains calories and g carbs ,nice flavor but not much to it , not as good as it is
there are no here the label promises a perfect blend between juice and carbonation and that is exactly what switch delivers a drink that tastes like carbonated orange juice those looking for a healthier alternative to soda will like that switch contains juice with no added sugar or corn syrup those looking for a tasty new carbonated beverage probably will not be impressed br br at the time of this writing amazon is not yet stocking switch so i cannot offer an opinion on whether or not i think the price is fair i would not expect to pay much more than orange juice for this drink though since there is nothing really original going on inside the can ,a healthier alternative to soda but not original , not as good as it is
tastes but i liked it okay it is not the best drink i have ever tried but it is okay for something different people will have to make their own choice as to whether to buy it or not in regard to the price br br unfortunately either the manufacturer the amazon vine people or both is there such a word if not i just invented it placed two useless stickers on the can which covered half of the nutrition facts on the can there was plenty of space to put them elsewhere but some non failed to use his or her marketing sense so all i can tell you on that is that there is a sodium content total carbs are grams and there are calories per ounce serving can br br i would not buy this product but that is because i normally drink only non sugar beverages ,and , not as good as i be
not too sweet not overly carbonated can be best described as a good orange punch mixed with and while it is all natural it is also reconstituted br br and that is the rub while tasty tangerine is the most prevalent flavor with hints of white grape and a slight finish this is basically just expensive carbonated juice can size is the same as a red bull oz versus the industry standard oz serving br br is more better not necessarily but then again sometimes less is just less at approximately per can which category the switch orange tangerine is is for you to decide ,a nice blend , a little juice
this tastes great and i like that it is more natural than most other sodas available basically it is a carbonated juice i generally prefer a larger oz size though ,quite refreshing great taste , great taste
i enjoyed the taste it is close to orange soda initially but then there is another sweet taste at the end of each sip but unlike orange soda this is healthier and no added sugars even though this product tastes like orange soda i think it would do well for breakfast it may even become preferred over traditional orange juice for children and for that worry about short shelf life on the downside the price is a little high for such a small can when buying ,pretty good , not as good as it is
i thought this would have a similar taste to another brand of carbonated juice on the market called izze that has fewer calories tastes better and costs less however switch has a weird artificial aftertaste it tastes like a blend between orange juice and orange soda but not in a good way also with calories per serving ounces and grams of sugar you might as well drink soda because this beverage it not any healthier and certainly not cheaper ,not for me , not bad
not a great value having around half again as many calories per once as coca cola does if you are some teen who can eat whatever you want this does not matter but for those of us who are not with such well the calories are better spent elsewhere the no sugar added bit is somewhere between annoying and misleading the all natural sugar that is coming from the fruit juices is no better nor worse for you than e g regular old cane sugar like better traditional soft drinks have br br so in brief yes it is quite tasty but it is really not a good deal for your nor your health unless consumed only on special occasions br br p s my wife tried some as well and did not like it as much she tasted some of the unpleasant metallic tastes that others here have mentioned ,tasty but i am not to switch , not as good as it is
while switch orange is very orangey it also tastes of something else interesting it is fizzy but not in my opinion excessively so and tasty and i would consider buying it i seldom buy or drink soft drinks or sodas i just do not care for all the fizz burning my nose switch did not do that ,very different , great taste
hubby and i both shared the and we both liked it i really liked the fact that there was no added sugar in this drink it is a nice combination of flavors i found it a little too carbonated but he thought it was just right br br i would buy it if it came in a larger can hence only stars i think this can is too small too much aluminum thrown out i everything but most people i know just toss it otherwise i would buy this drink ,not to sweet , not as good as it is
br i like br the carbonation br the flavor br all juice br no added sugar no high fructose corn syrup br no artificial flavors or colors br br i do not like br the small can oz br the flavor took a can to get used to it it is a mixture of orange apple grape and acerola juice acerola is a fruit high in vitamin c so i assume that is why it is used if you do not expect exactly orange soda the flavor grows on you quickly br br if i really want a cola switch is not good enough to be my replacement but it is a very easy replacement for an orange soda i cannot wait to try some of the other flavors i usually really like black cherry drinks and i am interested in seeing what fruit juices they use in that one ,great alternative to orange soda , great product
it is so hard to find a nice juice drink that is either too sugary or even worse has additives like artificial sweeteners the switch orange tangerine delivers on flavor if you like juice and want a full flavored orangy carbonated fizzy drink this one fits the bill very good ,a tasty enjoyable pure juice carbonated drink , not as good as it is
refreshing and light a little on the sweet side but not overly sweet i enjoyed the orange flavor ,nice drink , great taste
i am not one for canned juice drinks but this one was exceptional in flavor i am also not a big fan of orange flavored drinks but the tangerine is distinctive and nice it kind of reminded me of one of my favorite soft drinks in the world from jamaica which is made from real grapefruit juice very nice if you need more vitamin c in your life i would consider buying it ,tangerine , not as good as it is
i split this can with my i would have given it stars he gave it nice idea carbonated juice but the taste is pretty mild not really what i would call refreshing good idea though i would try it in other flavors ,just ok , great product
although some may like this drink it will not be a repeat buy for me calories for an oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is actually this drink is not orange tangerine juice but a mix of juices secondly if this were juice seems you would not have to add ascorbic acid to get of your daily vitamin c since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over perhaps the processing requires it but alas the biggest issue for me was taste it tasted to me like liquid smells br br on the good side the is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that there is no sugar added and the non traditional taste is not overly sweet the taste may appeal to some but i am not a fan ,bubble , not bad but not as good as it is
no caffeine no high fructose corn syrup juice nothing artificial what is not to like br br i hate to write anything negative because i do not want to discourage development of any products that avoid hfcs but to be honest the switch orange tangerine does not smell very good if you are familiar with cold remedy well it smells like that i think i was expecting a fragrance like tang instant beverage i certainly did not expect it to smell like it does it is not all that bad it is just not real good br br i also think this product would actually taste better if it were not carbonated br br the calories are about the same as a typical soda but they are fruit juice calories instead of hfcs so that is a big plus in my book ,gets an a for juice and no , not as good as it is
everyone at my house even my mother in law enjoyed this drink it tastes very much like a quality soda but is made with real juice small cans mean you do not consume a lot of calories at once because although this is healthier than regular soda you should not drink too much it is still a lot of sugar ,very at my house , not as good as it is
with all natural ingredients and mostly real fruit juice i am not expecting this drink to taste like soda punch or anything like that but i when i tasted it i felt myself wanting more i could really taste the orange flavor coming though but they somehow missed me on the tangerine side tangerines are very sweet so i was expecting that to be the predominant flavor but instead what i tasted was mostly orange which left a somewhat sour bitter aftertaste in my mouth this drink was not bad but given a choice i would rather drink orange juice or tangerine juice with seltzer i do not see how this drink improves beyond that switch other available flavors tasted much better so in some ways this was a disappointment ,too much orange not enough tangerine , not bad but not bad
i did not like this carbonated juice although it appears to be all juice not artificial flavors it tastes somewhat artificial perhaps it tastes more like canned orange juice which tastes nothing like real orange juice i fully expected to like this as i do like fizzy fruit juice drinks this one did not do it for me ,artificial tasting , great taste
perfect size can and a refreshing drink i think it is proof that simple is best this would be my first choice for a drink if i were out and about ,excellent choice , great taste
i like the taste of this drink in many ways it takes me back to my childhood with the orange ice i used to eat as it has a similar flavour the thing you should be aware of is that although it has no added sugar because it has so much fruit juice it does have a lot of calories i also found that the can needed to be bigger as i wanted more at the end ,nice tasting drink , not as good as it is
yeah it is gluten free and whatever but unless that is a really big issue for you and you are having trouble finding sugary drinks to enjoy on your gluten free diet there is no real draw to this drink over say orange fanta or any number of other carbonated juice type drinks i thought it was overly sweet and i have something of a sweet tooth the orange flavor was not particularly authentic or delicious and it left a sour aftertaste i got a free sample this time and i cannot see actually paying money to buy this product again on an environmental note packaging and shipping these things in tiny little cans makes for more waste and i do not appreciate that either not a fan ,too sweet too expensive too much packaging , not as good as it is
switch definitely managed to keep its carbonated juice drink intended flavor fresh though just a combination of sparkling water the juice concentrates of several fruits including apples grapes and oranges and oddly enough soy it definitely maintains its taste of tangerine br br i d love to see what other flavors switch has to offer with my only hesitation coming from natural flavors and colors but hey i am willing to them a little in that department thanks to the no high fructose corn syrup ,sweet and definitely full of tangerine goodness , great taste
it is very refreshing to find products without sugar added but make no mistake this tiny can still packs a solid grams of sugar enough to give you an energy rush followed by the typical crash perhaps you can sip just a few ounces every few hours to avoid the crash br br the flavor is very good and will tempt you to the whole can in one quick drink not exactly a health drink but it is a nice improvement over the usual junk sold as a soft drink ,flavor with , not as good as it is
nice alternative very lightly carbonated i would say if a normal carbonated drink from to on the fizzy scale this one about an br br at grams it is still a lot of sugar mostly from apple and grape juice i think i will order a case just cuz i thought it was good and i am calling it stars but honestly i would rather have it splenda or stevia sweetened ,good stuff , not as good as it is
i was surprised at the ingredient list and natural on the side because this drink tasted just like a artifical energy drink this is going to be a short review for me because i do not really have much else to say i could barely tell it was orange because as with energy drinks it just tastes like an of fruits my wife was especially confused she gets sick at the smell of drinks like monster and she had the exact same reaction here br br i know this is not an energy drink but for the life of me i just cannot the taste with the ingredients if you are the sort of person who drinks some fresh fruit juice and thinks i really wish this tasted more like a completely artifical drink instead of natural fruit juice then this is the product you have been of ,tastes like an energy drink , not bad
carbonation and the aluminum can which has been proved can lead to there is a lot of deceptive marketing going on the can claims that switch is juice but it is not actually orange and tangerine juice in fact the drink is mostly apple and grape juice you can taste this instantly along with the metallic tang of being in a can this is done because both of those juices are quite cheap in comparison to orange and tangerine so really you are getting more a a carbonated fruit punch then an orange tangerine drink br br you re also natural flavours and which kind of kills the whole juice claim br br with a taste that is both metallic and not really the flavours it claims i cannot really recommend this product you can generally buy boxed juice for less which contains more flavour no aluminum and no carbonation ,no in carbonated juice , not bad but not great
things you really do not want your children to eat or yourself the term gluten free for example is very important to those who have gluten intolerance br br kudos to the manufacturer for making a healthier product and i would have liked to have given this flavor a better review but the taste was not there for me the black cherry flavor has a lot better taste br br still if you are looking for a seemingly healthier beverage to pack in your child lunch this could be worth a try think of it as a flavored carbonated water i gave it stars because it is not unhealthy and it is not bad just not something i like the taste of br br i would sooner put this product in a child lunch than a soda my daddy used to put soda on the car to dissolve the acid ,orange tangerine carbonated fruit drink , like the soda
after taking my first sip of switch orange tangerine i raised a suspicious because it did not taste the way i expected it to then it on me that my mouth was prepared for more of a fake up orange soda but what i was tasting was real natural juice yes i knew that from the label but that is not the same as experiencing it br br the taste was a nice blend of orange and tangerine not too sweet and the carbonation adds a nice touch a bit like a non alcoholic cocktail br br my only is that the calorie count is perhaps too high for me to drink this on a regular basis though let me be quick to point out that this is a no sugar added product for those who are not counting calories a nice refreshing switch from soft drinks ,tangy and real , a great product
this drink is a nice blend of juices mostly orange and carbonated water there are no other ingredients it has a decent amount of natural sugars from the juice so it is not a low calorie drink i thought the balance of flavors and sweetness was quite nice and would definitely buy again ,carbonated juice , not bad
orange tangerine also contains soy br br compare and contrast a similar product is worth considering a href http www amazon com gp product b e izze all natural sparkling juice apple ounce cans pack of a a href http www amazon com gp product b izze all natural sparkling juice blackberry ounce cans pack of a a href http www amazon com gp product b x o c izze all natural sparkling juice clementine ounce cans pack of a a href http www amazon com gp product b izze all natural sparkling juice grapefruit ounce cans pack of a and a href http www amazon com gp product b izze all natural sparkling juice pomegranate ounce cans pack of a the difference the izze products are fortified with vitamins b and in addition to c and have roughly three the calories total carbohydrates and sugars of the switch products ,soda juice , soda
health conscious and want to drink something like a soda w o actually drinking a soda this would probably be right down your br br however i found the taste to be somewhat odd i could definitely taste the tangerine in it mixed with the orange but the combination of the two or the or something gives this switch a taste akin to eating an orange that is almost too ripe you know that kind of fermented taste of an orange that you need to eat now because by tomorrow you will need to put out for the not exactly something that i would look forward to drinking br br so for me although this was somewhat good its not exactly something i would get again i am not really a health nut so if i wanted an orange soda i would just go out and get an orange crush ,it was ok , switch to be the
soda also if you wanted something natural i would go with hansen sodas or a number of natural sodas which are definitely sodas this drink is basically juice with carbonation br br the other issue i had with this was its size does not get you far maybe and with the thickness of the drink since it is juice with quite a bit of natural sugar you do not get very much thirst quenching effect from this the juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste br br finally natural sugar is still sugar and has just as many calories this stuff would not make the cut in most school vending with its high sugar content and i would not give this to my kids instead a couple of waters juice pouches which each have about the amount of sugar would do the trick for them br br not recommended sorry ,did not like the flavor aftertaste or , great product
i am not sure what i expected maybe something thin and bubbly but switch delivers a rich full orange tangerine flavor br it got a lot more flavor and good flavor at that and a bit less carbonation than other carbonated fruit drinks br an ounce can has calories no fat mg of sodium grams of carbs grams of sugar they claim no sugar added and no protein it also contains of your daily requirement of vitamin c and of vitamin a br i tried it chilled with breakfast and thoroughly enjoyed it ,rich flavor , not as good as it is
this product is like orange juice that is fizzy it reminds me of another product izze but this product is slightly sweeter and is not as carbonated as izze i would recommend this product just make sure it is cold because it tasted alot better cold than warm ,really good , great taste
i put my orange switch in the refrigerator overnight to make it nice and cold and i had it with breakfast i love the taste of it mostly orange with a hint of carbonation it tastes sweet naturally and i am sure it is good for you i would buy this product ,tastes like orange but without the sugar corn syrup , great product
of a small tree of the west which has a high concentration of vitamin c anyway it is just good br br i experimented a little on the best way to serve i drank it cold as is then poured it over a glass of ice cubes neither of those ways seemed quite right then i poured the beverage on ice left it for a minute then removed the ice by pouring juice through a strainer this left it nice and chilled not just cold and not by melting ice br br i live in the desert where temperatures are in the summers orange juice does not quite quench my almost constant thirst but has been the best thing available to me until now yes i will definitely switch to switch forgive the pun br br it actually good for you too hope one day it will be in all ,an extremely carbonated drink , not bad
this was a weird drink i had high expectations but the flavor was just odd it really did taste like fizzy tang drink mix however my kids really liked it and i think it is a great alternative to soda so i will most likely buy more but not for me to drink ,tastes like carbonated , not as good as it is
it is a good thing the can is so small the product is several cuts below sunny delight terrible ,small can , great product
it may be all natural but it did not have a natural taste to me the can size is small and the calories were more than i thought there should be i like the mild carbonation ok but i would not switch from orange juice ,not for me , not as good as it is
i liked it br br didn t know what to expect it has a variety of fruit juices such as apple orange and grape but clearly had a strong orange taste i liked the fact there was no added sweeteners such as or sugar i am not a pop soda drinker but i think if i served this instead of the traditional orange stuff in a liter people would not notice the difference br br it a bit pricy for orange soda and i am sure orange juice would be better but if you are looking for something healthier this one for you ,fruity and not so , a great product
grape than orange surprisingly it has rda vitamin c it is all natural with no sugar added no corn syrup no preservatives no artificial colors and it is gluten free br br the flavor of the drink i tested was called orange tangerine and it was an fl oz can with calories and grams of sugar br br the only reason i did not give it five stars was that i really cannot picture myself paying for it it is rather expensive in comparison to the orange juice i buy at the grocery store and if i want an alternative to regular soda i would go with a href http www amazon com gp product b c blue jamaican ginger ale ounce pack of a now that is good however if you are looking for an orange flavored soda substitute this is your product juice how could you go wrong ,better than expected , orange orange soda
with the new of making sodas that are good for you too we have plenty to choose from in the drink switch orange tangerine has a great taste a fruity nose and is refreshing but with the same calorie content as a can of coke well i am sticking with coke had switch produced this product calorie free like a href http www amazon com gp product b d e immune tangerine lime ounce cans pack of a it would gain a greater market share with established soda drinkers while switch offers rda of vitamin c the pack on extras without padding our bodies ,if only it were diet too , a little juice
i did not read the label before i tried the drink so i was a little surprised by the carbonation it had a tangy flavor which was possibly enhanced somewhat by the carbonation however i have been a long time drinker of the tropicana orange tangerine juice and switch is simply not as good imho if i was not already a tropicana drinker i might be interested in the switch version of orange tangerine but i am not going to switch sorry for the pun ,it is ok but i prefer the version , not as good as it is
on the plus side they get the flavor and carbonation right here one a tang taste but it is more subtle than that and the bubbles are likewise enough that it is no fizzy drink br br on the downside though one would prefer a after taste to the sort of syrupy way it stays on the tongue ,a , not as good as it is
this is a very refreshing carbonated juice drink with no aftertaste i love the flavor and the fact that there is no added sugar it is more subtle than orange so really kills a thirst the size is perfect for times when you do not really want a ounce drink ,great taste not sweet , great taste
it is a refreshing drink when served cold a bit sweet when warm a little tart but so br br the flavor is less orange than tangerine yet i can several different layers of citrus in it including the orange it is an interesting sensation br br i am a little by the fact that an oz can rd size manages to pack more junk calories in than a full sized can of cola it is also supposed to be juice but reconstituted grape juice is practically pure sugar and there are natural flavors noted in the ingredients list as well as a soy warning which to me some sort of msg probably added with the citric acid br br so maybe it is not an especially healthy beverage it is still tasty and provides a from more typical sodas ,a decent if you are of , not bad but not as good as it is
bottled like an energy drink switch does not contain the things you would find in other carbonated beverages there is no sugar no caffeine no corn syrup no preservatives or artificial colors br br instead what you get is a refreshing all natural lightly carbonated tangerine orange drink loaded with vitamin c think of it as orange soda without all the things you do not want switch has just the right amount of carbonation to make the beverage refreshing without being filling br br it a zippy beverage made with real tangerine apple and grape juices and would make a refreshing beverage lunch dinner or snack time drink br br there was a slight aftertaste that i am up to either the can or the citrus but it did not get in the way of enjoying the drink br br make the switch to switch ,switch to a real energy drink , not bad but not bad
there is gum acacia in the list of ingredients not sure if it adds anything to the flavor the orange and tangerine flavors do come through the it seems to be a bit sweeter than orange juice have achieved more satisfying and natural tasting fizzy juice drink by adding sparkling water to oj ,sweet juice product , not as good as it is
i really like this drink my only complaint is that i would need to drink cans at a time oz is a bit on the side for me br br if it came in a oz can i would be much more likely to buy it and the packaging would be much less costly br br really tasty product though and i have got no with the ingredients yum ,tasty but too for me , not as good as it is
much smoother and easier to swallow than a conventional soda with carbonation that is plenty strong but not quite as strong as a can of crush br br it a drink that is subtle not only in tone but in flavor you can taste the various other fruits mixed in with the tangerine and orange but it is still very much an orange drink with no fruit punch br br it tastes perfect and there is no doubt that someone carefully went crazy saying too much not enough to every little of the drink before it was just right br br no corn syrup or other bad additives at carbs per ounce serving it is still got quite a lot of sugar in it if you are looking for an orange soda style drink that is really just carbonated juice this is the best possible product i am quite sure ,this drink is perfect and that is just that , it is not the
i enjoyed this drink it has a tangy citrus flavor which tasted a little less orangy than i expected but was still good i liked the carbonation in the juice it was about the right amount for me the drink has about the same calories as a regular soda but i feel better about drinking it because of the natural ingredients the drink does not have the syrupy feel of a traditional orange soda which is a bonus this is definitely a lighter tasting very refreshing drink the only reason for reducing the star value by one was because of the price which is a bit for me i recommend this drink ,yum carbonated fruit juice , not as good as it is
i could see it being handy for kids lunches and such slightly better than typical soda with corn syrup though i am not sure whether it would be preferable to straight up fruit juice br br personally i would rather have the fruit juice like a hansen smoothie or something granted they are a bit but some folks like carbonated beverages so why not make one out of actual fruit juices rather than all sorts of more artificial stuff br br rather liked the orange tangerine one i am interested now to try some of the other flavors and see if they are as good especially a href http www amazon com gp product b lggh kiwi berry a but possibly also a href http www amazon com gp product b lggh watermelon strawberry a or a href http www amazon com gp product b lggh c fruit punch a ,surprisingly good for a soda , a great product
base there is no added sugar no high fructose corn syrup or any other sweeteners save the apple and grape concentrates and that is fine i would prefer my juice to not have added sweeteners in my opinion juice does not need to be sweetened i suspect that the fruit concentrate combo is cheaper than making the drink out of pure citrus juice so i wonder why it is as expensive as it is br br what makes me scratch my head is the contains soy what why why on earth put soy in a fruit juice cooler honestly i would buy some seltzer or carbonated water of some sort and mix it with my own fruit juice before i would buy switch but if you would rather have it pre made then by all means give it a try it is decent enough just not my glass of juice ,decent enough but pricey , it is a
switch does not taste like carbonated juice it tastes like overly sweet orange soda which may or may not be a positive for you the ounce can contains grams of sugar i did not like the taste my husband thought it was okay br br the reason i am giving it stars instead of is because it does not have any preservatives added sugars or high fructose corn syrup it does however contain soy so if you are allergic or concerned about gmo soy then you may want to avoid this drink br br if you are looking for a natural sweet carbonated beverage i would recommend ooba hibiscus drink over this ,sweet orange soda , not as good as it is
vending machine br br for this product the first ingredient is apple juice and the second is grape juice then comes the tangerine and orange juice and finally acerola juice a fruit high in vitamin c and apparently popular in puerto rico and there is acacia gum as a probably do not want to have to shake a carbonated drink and then additional natural colors and flavors ascorbic acid and soy br br my yo daughter and i shared a can and liked the taste on a par with orangina my personal preference would be for a little more carbonation but this was ok i am a so i definitely prefer a oz can the quantity at this price makes me feel a little ripped but then i prefer to make my own lemonade in the blender adding in some raspberries or strawberries or mint to vary the flavor cheers ,a tasty carbonated fruit juice soda , a great product
if you are looking for a healthy alternative to your favorite orange soda this might be a good choice for you br br this is one of the better tasting switch flavors although it still tastes a bit like a flat orange or slice drink it is good but there is a bit of an aftertaste to watch out for it does not give you that weird filled up feeling that carbonated beverages seem to have but if you are looking for some refreshment on a hot summer day degrees where i live as i write this i would stick to tried and true kool aid instead br br decent and a good orange soda alternative but not life changing ,kind of like or , not as good as it is
no sugar added br no preservatives br juice carbonated br all natural br br but it tastes just like soda br br if you are a soda lovers but want a healthier alternative this may be just the ticket it is an especially great product for kids because they really think they are getting soda but without all the added sugars ,switch to the switch , not as good as it is
my daughter thinks this tastes like sunkist orange soda my grandson likes it and drank the rest of it most of the can i thought it was okay by i am not a fan of orange sodas i would undoubtedly like it better in another flavor like grape or fruit punch or kiwi berry br i think this is of course a much healthier alternative to any regular soda and judging from my and my grandson experience with it it would be hit with most kids ,good alternative to regular orange soda , great taste
switch is a tangy drink that is more reminiscent of sprite than orange juice it is carbonated all the way and you will even after it as you would have after consuming any soft drink the drink does not feel sugary but a quick glance at the nutritional facts that each can contains grams of sugar the claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added so i am assuming that is the sugar from the orange and tangerine the can ,with vitamin c , a little juice
in proportion this drink is about equal to a regular soda in calories and sugar content but i would prefer a regular soda than this stuff there is a slight citrus taste but mainly from acidity and a horrible after taste of metal and sickly sweetness that lingers for several minutes after br br soda water with natural juice should be a refreshing pleasant and nice refreshment but none of these are in this drink br br i would be embarrassed to serve this beverage to anyone i liked for any occasion but would consider giving it to people i really did not care for to see their reaction br br avoid this one orange crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame ,sweet bad aftertaste , not the best
our family wife year old and year old have had other switch sodas in the past and liked them quite a bit they had a bit of an apple flavor the main that is definitely not true for the orange tangerine it tastes almost like fresh squeezed orange juice with bubbles far better than orangina or orange soda br br my kids kept asking for more sips of the soda throughout dinner and we all have enjoyed it i appreciate that there is no caffeine and it is all natural so i have no problem giving it to my kids i would definitely recommend buying the soda we will keep some around the house regularly ,great orange soda without too sweet , a great product
stars is a compromise between my rating of and my grandchildren rating of stars i thought the flavor was too heavy on the apple grape juice combo and light on the orange tangerine flavor also it left a mild canned aftertaste but my year old loved it and consider it a treat equal to soda it is juice concentrate which has been reconstituted with carbonated water so it is much healthier for them than regular soda while it is true it still has sugar natural sugars from the juices are healthier than processed sugars found in soft drinks the can i was sent contained ounces which is a better size for them than a regular ounce can of soda for children this is a tasty and healthy alternative ,kids love it this healthy choice , not as good as i like
this is a decent flavored carbonated juice it is juice which is good for the more health conscious people it tastes pretty good sweet and a little tangy but the flavor does fall short like some reviewers have said the drink tastes more like a punch than pure orange or tangerine juice do yourself a favor if you want orange flavored soda then go for an orange flavored soda if you want tangerine then buy tangerine the infusion of both flavors really causes both flavors to fall short slightly short ,nothing special , not bad but not great
tastes like what you would get if you squeezed part tangerine and part orange and then poured in a bit of sparkling soda very fresh tasting not too sweet at all the label says there is no sugar added fine as it doesnt need any the label also says it has apple and grape juice i taste mostly the tangerine myself but you may find your varies finally it is supposed to give you a full days worth of vitamin c ok a lot of drinks can do that but without any refined sugar of high fructose corn syrup or artificial sweetener i could totally see replacing my orange soda with this stuff i have not seen this in the market yet but i would be willing to try other flavors and add switch to the many beverages i enjoy really for a fruit drink it is pretty darn good ,really very tasty , not bad but not bad
there is nothing wrong with this drink but it really just tastes like any other orange soda kudos to the switch for not adding artificial flavors sugar or corn syrup though it tastes pretty clean and refreshing but a bit expensive for what it is br br don t let the small sized can oz fool you this is not an energy drink it is just an orange soda ,it is good but pretty much tastes like orange soda , not as good as it is
like the switch beverage i previously reviewed this is a tasty drink the balance of the carbonation and the fruit juice is decent enough giving more of a to the tongue than the rush of bubbles that soda usually gives it is definitely a lot more like juice than soda which goes against its purpose of being a replacement for soda overall it is pretty drinkable but i would never seek this beverage out there are better juices and there are better sodas br br one major plus though was that it was not as thick and syrupy as the watermelon strawberry switch br br ,just pretty good , not as good as it is
i was really looking forward to this beverage as i love tangerine juice and the thought the combination of orange tangerine and carbonated water would make for a great soda br br i have to say it is different but not what i expected while it was different than a typical orange soda i did not find it that different either in sweetness or taste i probably prefer it to traditional orange sodas and i believe it to be superior to many supposedly natural sodas but i was surprised how similar it really is to artificially flavored drinks a bit more maybe a lot more orange and tangerine juice would be good ,different maybe better , not as good as it is
i have always been a fan of premium beverages and sodas i will never buy pepsi or coke products at a minimum i will by jones because they use pure cane sugar i really enjoyed getting to try this product and i am actually going on now to start ordering it on a regular basis br br you can really tell the difference between pop and juice with sparkling water it is a bit on the sweet side and i did not think they needed to add the extra juice flavors to make it just right however this is a great product good size for individual servings and it arrived in good packaging by amazon ,the of this drink , great product
if you like orange crush you may become a fan but it is too much of a for me the main two ingredients are reconstituted apple and grape juices it contains something called acerola juice which is high in vitamin c and indeed the can contains of your c and of your a br br the sugar content is high grams which brings the carb percentage up to for the day and the calorie count to i think it tastes too acidic for anyone who is watching carbs and calories to be willing to spend them on switch which almost tastes like carbonated tang i have tried the ooba drinks and they are much lighter and more refreshing guess i am just not ready to make the switch ,high sugar acidic taste not to make the switch , not as good as it is
if you are a regular drinker of orange soda pop you might like this switch orange tangerine carbonated juice beverage i thought the flavor was very good and appreciated that it was only mildly carbonated not so fizzy that i had gas after drinking it at calories per small serving however this is not something i would regularly drink it is much healthier to eat whole fruit since it is more filling that simply drinking the extracted juice in part because of the fiber associated with eating whole foods still this is a healthier option for those who regularly drink sugared sodas ,tasty lightly carbonated good alternative for soda pop , not as good as it is
your own orange juice for an identical benefit at a lower price br br the taste is fairly good it is heavy on the tangerine flavor its a bit syrupy with a high carbonation typical of many european drinks i have had br br the juices that this beverage in order of quantity are br apple br grape br tangerine br orange br acerola cherry br br needless to say i think it would be difficult to the exact flavor at home due to the mix of the juices they have overall you probably will be pleased with the drink certainly the canned beverage is more convenient than mixing your own which is impossible if you are on the go br br i will probably be buying more of this product however i did not find the flavor to be so that i would recommend it heartily to a friend ,good , not bad but not bad
make you feel sluggish it is hard to describe other than to say they got it right no extra sugar yet it is very sweet but not too sweet br br i shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments we both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case br br while i am not sure it could replace my coke it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake the only problem there always seems to be something is that it is about times the cost of my coke per oz i could justify twice the cost but four times is the only reason i have not ordered more so far i do expect to breakdown and buy a case but i still will not be happy over the cost difference ,drink healthier without the taste but at cost , not as good as it is
this is a wonderfully refreshing citrus drink not too sweet or too sour just enough bubbles to make it sparkle i would imagine it could make a great addition to a punch if you chose to add it to your favorite fruit juice the only draw back for me is that it is a tad bit too to replace our families normal beverage of choice but it sure does make a terrific treat to keep around for an indulgence ,very tasty soda alternative , great taste
very nice drink i enjoyed it especially when it was chilled the flavor is powerful but not overpowering i loved the bubbles great drink ,makes your mouth happy and , great taste
which is not a bad thing for me as i find the orange sodas way too sweet and left a tiny bit of an odd aftertaste it is a healthier alternative to regular sodas as there is no high fructose corn syrup but it was still just as caloric it is juice rather than artificial syrups but the first juices listed in the ingredients are the overly sweet apple and grape not orange and tangerine to make the drink taste sweeter i suppose honestly considering the price of this product and the lukewarm impression it left on me i would rather just pour my own juice blend and add soda water or sparkling water to it myself most juices seem to be vitamin c fortified themselves so unless you are just looking to replace the artificial sodas with something less damaging i cannot see a big benefit to this product ,it is ok , not bad
i enjoyed the flavor of this orange soda it was not overly sweet and the orange flavor had just enough tartness to it i am glad it does not have any hfcs in it but the calorie count is still quite high from the natural sugars all in all if you are looking for a good orange soda try this one ,good tasting orange soda , great taste
this drink is very good especially after a long hot workout it quenches the thirst without all the added sugars and preservatives i highly recommend ,very good , great product
this product taste like an orange juice an artificial one but with less sugar and less flavor i did not like it ,like an orange juice , great taste
this has great flavor but i am not sure it would be a soda alternate i am thinking it would be good for a lunch or mini fridge at work tastes great but i really did not get the carbonation kick i get from a soda ,great flavor , great taste
i thought i would like this more than i do maybe it is my palate but my first taste impression was pineapple not orange or tangerine the small portion size may be acceptable for an energy drink but is not what i would call thirst quenching not a good choice for anyone trying to control calories or carbs on the plus side it is sweet but not too sweet and the level of carbonation is well balanced ,not what i expected , not as good as it is
of pure unsweetened grape juice it is the same calorie and sugar count plus or minus it worth noting that grape juice is the first listed ingredient so this makes sense thus they are probably not adding sugar or calories to the juice to make the drink the thing is you probably should not down ten of these a day but one can as a snack or pick me up seems reasonable br br flavor here is where switch fell short in the watermelon kiwi flavor but i was pleasantly surprised to find that this flavor was refreshing and delicious it was not overly sweet like watermelon kiwi i am also very impressed with the flavor it is like a less sweet orange soda except that it is with real juice instead of artificial sweeteners i think this would be a great mixer as well as a nice snack beverage ,really good flavor surprisingly soda like for a juice product , great product
i tried two flavors of switch the orange tangerine and the watermelon strawberry i liked the watermelon flavor a lot but found that with orange tangerine the flavor of the can came through a bit too much it reminded me of why i have never really enjoyed drinking canned orange juice still it was fairly good and the carbonation made it light and refreshing both flavors were a big big hit with my year old son ,not bad , not bad
this stuff taste just like flavored carbonated water br in this case flavored with orange and tangerine br i imagine it is better for you than plain soda br i really found it tasty it has a strong citrus flavor br that i preferred to some of the other flavors ,my favorite flavor , great taste
i do not like how so many bottled and canned drinks these days even the low calorie ones are so sweet this was nicely not too sweet but had a canned not fresh juice flavor it is personal taste but i did not care for the processed flavor ,not too sweet but not full juice taste , not as good as it is
it contains all natural fruit which is a big plus over the fruit flavored options it contains some calories but since it is from a natural source and not just plain sugar i am okay with it this beverage is in a can with only oz versus the usual ozs of say a can of soda so you save a few calories but not much it hits the spot when i want something sweeter then plain mineral water and it is healthier then soda br br i ve tried other sparkling fruit drinks with lower satisfaction marks most of them claim to be all natural but list funky ingredients such as natural flavorings this beverage lists ingredients that are easily also it avoids the overly sweet taste of other similar this one stands out as a winner but less calories would make it perfect i guess you cannot have everything ,one of the better , not as good as it is
our family is a huge fan of izze and this was right in line with that the flavor was not too sweet and refreshing my favorite way to enjoy this was with some ice and vodka obviously that is only for those of you reading this that are yrs or older ,in line with that the flavor was not too sweet and refreshing my favorite , great taste
the product may be every bit as healthy as they claim but even if that is true i could barley get down one can of this stuff it tastes like sour orange juice with some carbonation in it it does not taste anything like orange soda and the taste it does have is not very pleasant also leaves a very nasty aftertaste and like many sodas this will leave you more thirsty than when you started drinking all in all i cannot recommend this stay away ,nothing like they nasty tasting , not as good as it is
i am not a big fan of carbonated juices but am a huge lover of orange tangerine in that respect this was a disappointment for me not being as enough for me the first sip left me with an extremely unpleasant aftertaste but had gotten easier to tolerate with additional sips but after waiting a while for another sip that initial returned if i am going to drink juice i will stick to what i prefer ,nothing special , not as good as it is
i also got the cherry one and this is just as good it is a break from soda or water or coffee i really liked the light refreshing taste and it does not fill you up like sodas can it is very very tasty and it had a very fresh orange taste not artificial tasting i really liked it ,wonderful , great taste
we are big fans but we were excited to try this we were very pleasantly pleased it is a very orange taste delicious and it feels good to know there is absolutely no sugar so when our children want a soda we serve this and they are delighted it is a win win ,sweet and delicious , great product
i repeat carbonated fruit drinks can be too sugary this drink reminds me of other orange soda brands without the extra sugar that combined with the metallic can always leaves an odd taste in my mouth orangina has a bit more flavor but switch tangerine orange is light and refreshing ,light and refreshing , great taste
product the cute tiny can looks great but do not fall for it this little guy packs an amazing calories per oz can my favorite oz arizona iced tea black white tea with sugar has almost just as many calories and almost times the size of switch also do not be tempted with vitamin c and vitamin e either most of us consume of daily vitamin c without even trying through foods and anything extra get eliminated br br the taste however does feel a bit more natural than other artificial orange sodas though so that is the only plus also if you do not worry about gaining weight i guess this is a good way to get a sugar rush in a tiny can br br overall a good tasting product but there are many other low caloric alternatives out there a can of diet coke and a anyone ,more like candy in a can , not bad but not as good as it is
if you love orange soda but do not want to drink soda this is the perfect product for you this taste just like orange soda but is actually made of real fruit juice no joke it really tastes good i loved it br br however just b c you do not have all the fake soda ingredients it still has tons of calories for ounces to be exact a can of soda has for ounces so i am not sure what the trade off is you want of your vitamin c ,orange soda flavor with real fruit juice , great taste
i love everything about this drink it is got plenty of carbonation even without added sugar or artificial sweeteners it is plenty sweet without being too sweet i love tangerine and this has a very tangerine y flavor and aroma if you love oranges or tangerines this is the perfect drink for you br br i ordered this from the vine program out of but it will be one of my must buy items in the future i am also going to buy some for my grandchildren since it has no added sugars and i know they will love it it will be perfect for them ,awesome taste and healthy too , great taste
orange crush type soda switch comes across with a more acidic taste this can of switch tastes like well carbonated orange juice to me this is a good thing i enjoyed the flavor and found it tasty and pleasantly unique br br given all that i would absolutely buy this product all of the time if it was not for the unfortunate price these cans are only ounces and cost close to per can that is a heck of a lot more than the you pay for a ounce can of mainstream soda when purchased as a typical or pack br br i love the taste of this stuff i love that it does not have all kinds of extra refined sugar and i hate the price i want to buy it but i just cannot afford it and have to drop it to stars on that alone too bad ,great natural orange taste price , a great product
looks like juice it is lightly but distinctly carbonated and easy to drink the orange and tangerine flavors are true none of the burn of fake orange flavor the hit of tangerine is really nice and i greatly enjoyed the flavor my problem with the switch was that it was too sweet for my taste i was surprised at the how sweet it was given the advertised no added sugar the ingredient list mentions grape and apple juice concentrates that is how they get the sugars in without adding sugar fruit juice concentrates are loaded with natural fruit sugars the nutritional label tells the story the oz can has grams of sugar that is more than cocoa cola grams per oz bottom line this is just too sweet for me it is too bad because the flavors are awesome if you have a sweet tooth maybe this is for you ,switch has true tangerine orange flavors but it is too sweet no added , not bad but not bad
living in germany for several years i acquired a taste for or for short apple juice and sparkling water the soda water cuts the sweetness gives the juice a little tang and makes the drink a better the juice makes the soda water a little more interesting i usually drink any fruit juice this way now br br switch my the blend was and orange citrus rather than apple but very good regardless i tried it straight but it would have been better over ice or if it had been mixed with a little more soda water and a little less juice the ingredients were juice sparkling water and a couple of without two of my pet artificial color especially red and high fructose corn syrup br br i enjoyed it and can recommend it as an excellent alternative to conventional soda br br e m van ,for , a great product
i was looking forward to tasting the switch orange tangerine drink since orange and tangerine flavors are two of my favorite but i was disappointed in the result br br it was tangy it tasted of ascorbic acid it smelled of orange candy it reminded me of breakfast it reminded me of yes powdered tang mixed with carbonated water followed by a strong unpleasant artificial aftertaste i found the the drink to be simply not very good br br i tried to like the beverage and i did appreciate the concept but considering the unusual flavors high calorie count of cals oz and cost of almost a dollar serving i cannot recommend switch ,switch no , not as good as it is
the switch orange tangerine is one of the most refreshing drinks that i have ever tried it is pure orange and tangerine juice and the difference from the regular sodas is quite obvious right from the first sip it feels richer and tastier than any soda product out there after drinking it you may never go back to regular sodas again it works well by itself or with a meal this may be an ideal substitute for sodas for kids as it is a much more nutritious drink the only problem that i have is the size of the can at ounces it may be enough for a kid but you would need more than one of these to quench an adult thirst ,the true soda , great taste
no harsh after taste no it just does not have the bite that i crave from other carbonated beverages like ginger ale or root beer it is a good option for a healthful drink with some fizz ,nothing earth i it though it lacks bite , not as good as it is
i have become a fan of the switch sodas the black cherry flavor has a great balance of flavoring and carbonation that had me ready to give up traditional sodas the orange flavor however leaves a lot to be desired it has a really strong after taste and despite being juice it tastes like bad artificial orange flavoring br br i d opt for the grape or the black cherry for sure a href http www amazon com gp product b lg e the switch black cherry ounce cans pack of a br br also you will want to note that the switch sodas are not exactly healthy they are simply not with artificial flavors they actually have a fairly high calorie count that being said they have some health benefits over pop like the vitamin count and no added sugars ,not the best switch flavor , not bad but not as good as it is
i expected to like this drink because i like various fruit juices and i like carbonated beverages as well unfortunately i just did not like the consistency or the taste of this drink it was thick had very little bubbly carbonation and for me anyway there was a very unpleasant aftertaste that lasted a time i finally brushed my teeth really well and used some strong to get rid of the taste in my mouth ,thick drink with a taste , not as good as it is
this drink is ok a little pricier with several more calories and carbs than i would like but it is a good alternative to soda i am glad there is no artificial sweetener in it it is sweet enough without it i like the crayons drinks better but cannot find them anymore i also like the flavor of the r w a little more ,it is an ok drink , not as good as it is
i think sodas are a big waste of money that said i had the opportunity to try this and it is divine ,totally delicious , good but not great
i thought the drink was delicious but too sweet i mixed it half n half with sugar free ginger ale and loved it however i rarely drink sugared drinks you need to make a sugar free version ,sugar free version needed , the best
i am always looking for a carbonated alternative to sodas so i thought i would give this a try generally i enjoy drinking naturally flavored sparkling water like la or crystal i also very much enjoy sparkling water juice blends unlike which combines juice and water this is a juice beverage that is carbonated i have to say it is definitely full of flavor but it is just too sweet tasting i like a bit of orange juice now and then but for this type of carbonated drink i am just not into all that sweetness i tried diluting it with some sparkling water but the flavor just was not quite what i wanted i like that is just a bit on the tart side with it is flavors this is a nice idea and it is pretty ok i just prefer other beverages over this one ,a bit too sweet for my taste , not bad but not as good as it is
this drink has a wonderful orange citrus flavor it is robust but not too strong a great natural alternative to soda my year old likes it as well would not hesitate to purchase ,delicious , great taste
drink and overall i like it it tastes very similar to mandarin orange slice but it uses natural juices and no hfcs if you are very concerned about artificial flavors and but still want a carbonated drink then switched may be a good alternative i read the ingrediants list and it mainly included reconstituted and then another line of preservatives and additives i would assume similar to those in commercial fruit juices br br personally i am more concerned about overall sugar and calories in my soft drinks so this little oz can has calories and grams of sugar if memory serves me that is in line with the calories of most and more sugar then most soft drinks br br ultimately i think this is a good product but the touted benefits does not outweigh the increased price and availability to soda i guess the key is still moderation ,tastes good but to the , like the taste
i was not sure what to expect from a carbonated fruit drink but decided to give it a try while it was drinkable i actually prefer the natural taste of fruit juice this actually tasted like an artificial soda much like a very well known orange soda the carbonation was excessively strong with too much bite and burn for my liking br br as some other reviewers pointed out the amount of sugar and calories in this drink was astounding it is almost too sweet and combined with the carbonation was just too much for me to enjoy it very much ,not as advertised , not as good as it is
i could not finish this drink it is like drinking orange syrup it may not have any added sugar in it but one can of ounces has sugar grams and carbs i will stick to water when i want to quench my thirst ,sweet , not as good as it is
i really liked the of this it actually tastes like you are getting the juice from a tangerine i think the carbonation gives it that zing taste you can only get biting into an tangerine orange etc br my daughter however really did not like it not sweet enough for her br i think it is a little pricey not sure i would be willing to down that much for it the can is very small fl ozs which is a proper serving of orange juice which makes it around a can or a little less br but overall i truly enjoyed that tangerine taste ,tastes like a tangerine , not as good as it is
this is for sure not what i was expecting it to taste like it is not bad but not for me i like the carbonation and juice idea with no added sugar when i first took a sip of it i noticed it has a bite to it the best way i can describe it is a non alcoholic champagne i however did like it better than the watermelon but still not for me ,kind of taste like a cheap , not as good as it is
this carbonated juice drink tastes incredibly good it reminds me of eating fresh tangerines when i was a kid yet this is a drinkable version of that if you like oranges and tangerines you will love this these ought to be in every school vending machine instead of sodas br br this is made from juice so great for adult or kids lunches etc a great drink for exercise as well and does not have the sugar in it so no spikes in blood sugar likely a good choice for diabetics as well and without the artificial sweeteners ,awesome soda water alternative tastes great , great taste
i say all these reviewers who say this stuff is too sweet are wrong have it on the rocks the melting ice will water it down just right i tried four flavors and here is my br br st place a href http www amazon com gp product b lggh kiwi berry a br nd place a href http www amazon com gp product b lggh watermelon strawberry a br rd place a href http www amazon com gp product b lg e black cherry a br th place a href http www amazon com gp product b lg o orange tangerine a ,sweet treat , not as good as the
less than in a regular soft drink br br i found the flavor pleasing with none of the chemical or metallic taste which can occur in many brands of orange soda the soft of the drink the orange flavor well i did not really get a true tangerine taste from the soda tangerines are a very acidic fruit and have a very distinct taste which i did not really get from this soda however the taste is very smooth and quite refreshing my daughters and their friends loved this soda and i have been re ordering it every so often as a treat br br switch is a bit pricy you can cut down on the price by up for regular deliveries but so far i have not given in to that temptation however i am buying it for special occasions for the travel cooler and for planned teen get ,pleasing orange soda a but worth it , a great product
this one tasted pretty good very tangy but in a real fruit kind of way i think they got this one right i still cannot ever see myself buying a bunch of this maybe if amazon sent me more than a single can to try i would have build a of drinking them cough hint cough br br i do not really understand any drink this size if i were thirsty at all i would want way more at least oz the only other drinks this size are those crazy energy drinks and those are obviously more of a means to an end kind of drink i guess it is supposed to be more of a gourmet soda juice i guess there is a market for that i am just not part of it br br nice little carbonated juice but still not really worth the effort money for me ,good ok maybe , not bad but not as good as it is
this small can of juice is tasty the carbonation makes this beverage very delightful and the juice is not too sugary it is good to see this drink in the market although i would have liked a larger size container so i could drink more at a time the switch drink is loaded with tangerine goodness hooray ,flavorful and good , great taste
switch has of what you want and of what you don t according to the can also according to the can it is juice according to the amazon product page it contains soy the printed page ingredients juice filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juice concentrates gum acacia natural flavors and colors ascorbic acid vitamin c contains soy br br there is an unusual taste it is difficult to decide whether it is the taste of the can or the taste of the soy br br the price is surprising the calories are one can has calories br br who knows we may develop a taste for switch ,the new juice , great taste
i usually cringe a little before i do a natural juice carbonated beverage there is frequently something of an aftertaste that is unpleasant br br this is refreshing light very bubbly and leaves a bright taste after with no cringe effects br br i definitely would buy this drink ,a flavor winner , great taste
i certainly hope that switch will be selling this product in larger packages i was very disappointed when my tangerine soda was gone it was very good actually tasted like tangerines which was a surprise as most of the sodas on the market do not have much distinctive flavor at all switch sodas are pleasantly carbonated sweet without being overwhelming so and very satisfying particularly when drunk very cold ,very nice tangerine soda , not as good as it is
reconstituted with carbonated water acacia gum some soy and added vitamin c to provide percent of the adult minimum daily requirement there are no artificial flavors or additives which allows the manufacturer to describe this as a natural beverage br br i often mix juice with seltzer water and i like the combination quite cold the switch orange tangerine tasted more like orange soda with a tangerine chaser than what i am used to as juice flavor br br the carbonation makes the drink seem lighter than juice but not as light and refreshing to the mouth as juice and seltzer br br the tangerine flavor made the taste seem more appealing than orange soda but the orange and tangerine flavors do not last as long as soda flavors do on the palate br br i would drink this again on a hot day if i could buy it enough ,a carbonated juice that tastes like orange soda with a tangy tangerine out by , not bad but not bad
at first i really wanted to like this drink the switch tasted like tangerines and had a good aroma the drink is carbonated but not really strongly so it is pleasant however after a few seconds an after taste developed that was a little bitter my wife thought this after taste was even a little off but she has a more sensitive palate than i do in any case the net effect was that i would just as soon have orangina and i will not be going out to buy more of the switch orange tangerine on the other hand if this is what was being served at a party or gathering with few or no other choices i would not avoid it either ,just ok for me , not as good as it is
situations or during other times where small cans make better br br it not exactly a post workout recovery drink juice would be better minute maid juice for instance has less sugar and carbohydrates even though switch does not add any sugar and there are plenty of other juices that have more nutrients including calcium and other vitamins and supplements including potassium so it is less healthy than most juices br br switch is not exactly a diet soda because of the natural sugar content to zero sugar in diet drinks br br as a regular alternative to sugared soda it tastes good but there is nothing really to it from other fruit based sodas and a case it is more than twice as expensive of sodas that come in bigger cans br br so in the end switch is worth a try but likely not something you will buy ,a drink without a , a great product
who knew juice could be so cool it has a very refreshing taste and lightness just the right amount of sweet not too much switch is an apt name for this beverage i am guessing that lots of folks will be making the switch from cola to carbonated juice once they get a taste of this product line ,like orange soda only way better , not as good as it is
this product advertises that it is a soda made from fruit juices and is refreshing i was quite disapointed in the flavor if you have ever been unfortunate enough to drink canned not refrigerated or fresh squeezed oj you know there is a huge in flavor the bad almost rotting component is carried over into this soda it even carries a rather odd aftertaste i was not able to finish the entire can br br this may be a feature of the orange flavor other fruit flavors of this product might indeed taste good but i recommend the orange version ,did not on the , not as good as it is
this was actually a surprisingly refreshing drink that is lighter then oj and reminds me of a virgin there was little after taste and the flavor is not overbearing like an orange soda the best thing is its all natural with no corn syrup the bad thing is that the size is a little small at only oz which is probably to keep the calorie count down overall a good refreshing pick me up but you may want to drink more then one ,natural drink , not as good as it is
my daughter i were excited about trying this flavor as we both love orange juice this product did not impress us enough to order it as we liked other flavors more my son also tried it and did not care for it the orange tangerine flavors are masked by the other fruit juices and makes it taste odd i like the fact that has added vitamin c and is a healthy alternative to sodas but the flavor on this one needs ,not as tasty as it could be , great taste
ive tried the black cherry version of this drink and i prefer that to this both are light and refreshing and way better than fruit flavored waters yuk you can tell by the taste these are definitely fruit juices but without the sticky thick sweetness of a non carbonated drink this orange tangerine flavor though there is this weird taste to it one that hits you immediately not quite bitter not quite metallic but definitely not yummy unless you like bitter fruit not sour bitter maybe it is too much carbonation for my taste if you have tried the other flavors and are looking to try something new think twice about this one it is tingly and refreshing but i will not order it again ,ok but not my , not as good as it is
i did not mind the taste of this very much it tasted like minute maid oj mixed with soda my husband could not stand it at all my only issue with this was that it was a heavy syrup sort of flavor that was a little overwhelming if there was a better balance of flavor to liquid to make it a little lighter tasting i think this would be much more refreshing and enjoyable might be fine for kids though since they like that sugary orange stuff ,a little but not bad , not as good as it is
drink it was okay though not something i would buy often and certainly not worth the price in my opinion br br it was not as orangey as i expected and it was not until i had half of it gone that i read the ingredient list and saw why orange juice is actually the fourth juice listed on the ingredient list with apple and grape juice first and second and the tangerine that seems to tone down the sweetness slightly the third on the list br br when you look at the nutrition information this product has about more calories than coke classic and despite not having any added sugar the grams of sugar in this product is more than an equivalent amount of coca cola the only bonus of this over real soda is the vitamin c and a there is not much else nutritionally to speak of ,pricey sugar okay taste , not as good as it is
the can size is like a drink however its sugar content is grams attached is a photo of the facts br br in terms of its taste in my opinion it is quite tasty sweet a bit tangy and very ,good taste but high in calorie , not as good as it is
span class tiny length mins br br span short video review with first open pour and taste of the switch orange tangerine ,good flavor small high in calories , not as good as
this is the size of the can compared to the price br br the one thing that i had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can which as i stated earlier comes in at ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at ounces in addition to the size of the can there is also the consideration of price coming in at roughly per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda therefore when you take the size of the product combined with the price i would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product br br if they created a ounce can and lowered the price then i would be more apt to purchase it br br br of the series ,not a bad alternative to soda but not a great one either , a great product
i did not find this drink anything special in terms of taste it is orange juice infused with carbonation the juice is quite acidic and you do not feel that there is fruit juice the drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer it does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free no sugar and no artificial flavors this drink does not have any special features and it does not stand out well in a market with many drinks br br a href http www amazon com gp product b izze fortified sparkling juice pomegranate ounce cans pack of a br a href http www amazon com gp product b q minute maid mixed berry juice fl oz bottles fl oz a br cal certified organic juices clementine fluid ounce by com ,carbonated orange juice in a can , not as good as it is
the product says a twist because of carbonation well after pouring the drink over pieces of ice the carbonation was gone the carbonation is definitely light and does not last br br as far as the taste goes i did not care for the taste at all it left a bad after taste in my mouth i cannot recommend this product i will stick with regular juice at a much lower cost br br to be fair i gave it two stars because my wife thought it was ok ,not a fan has an odd taste in , not as good as it is
g sugar br br besides slightly less sodium the addition of vitamins and no added sugars a href http www amazon com gp product b lg o the switch orange tangerine ounce cans pack of a did not really stand out as a winner based on nutritional facts alone so when it came to drinking it i had expected to prefer the more natural taste that the switch might offer unfortunately the main two juices used in this drink are apple and grape and that left me not tasting the orange tangerine as much as i had wanted br br overall when comparing the two beverages not only did it not impress me with taste or nutrition but add on the obvious price difference per ounce vs per ounce and the switch will not be causing me to switch i am happy to stick with my good old orange soda ,the switch soda , not bad but not great
while i thought that drink was decent i was not a big fan of the orange tangerine flavor the taste was an obvious blend of a number of different flavors in addition to orange and tangerine and for me that made it taste more orange ish than orange as others have noted the amount of calories and sugar are not that different from a cola so it is not really clear that it is that much healthier than other sodas br br personally though i would rather just grab a glass of orange juice or eat an orange instead i guess it depends on what you are deciding to switch from for people looking for an alternative to cola i guess this might be an attractive product but as someone who prefers water or tea and rarely drinks sodas this product is not close to making me want to switch ,not terrible but i would just have orange juice , not as good as it is
i like orange soda but usually cannot drink an entire can or bottle of sunkist or a href http www amazon com gp product b a kg orange crush case pk a because they are so sickly sweet this has just the right touch of natural sweetness and the tangerine gives a nice little tang to the orange flavor reminds me of the great orange sodas you can get in europe or specialty shops like a href http www amazon com gp product b orangina sparkling citrus beverage with natural pulp cans a or a href http www amazon com gp product b san pellegrino pack oz bottles a br br dare i say it yes the flavor and size make it a perfect mixer after my sip i immediately thought it would be great to fill up the rest of the glass with vodka ,tasty not too sweet , a great product
flavors and colors and some ascorbic acid vitamin c and as a little surprise bonus they have added soy soy br br i asked my wife to taste this product with me i poured the drink into two glasses and we both took a sip her reaction was and strong she hated it i agreed with her it was for me sickly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste in my mouth not only that but the taste was just nasty it did not taste at all like orange or tangerine to me it just tasted terribly sweet with an something taste the carbonation did not add anything positive to the experience neither of us finished drinking our oz portion it went down the sink br br i would not purchase this product in the future and if i could have given it stars i would have it is that bad ,tasting flavor yuk , not bad but not bad
i found this to be a nice alternative to juice and to the usual pepsi that i normally drink br br it had a nice light flavor with just a little carbonation i do not believe tangerine is the right name for the taste i would say a tart orange juice is more accurate however the name of the drink does not take away from the quality of the product br br i let my children try a little bit of this and they too thought it was a very good taste br br the cans are small smaller than a coke can but i found one to quench my thirst better than any of the caffeinated drinks i would normally pick up ,enjoyable , not as good as it is
fruit juice has lots of calories so at home we often dilute grape or orange juice with water or seltzer and ice we like the flavor and the bubbles make for a more refreshing drink the switch is a portable alternative a little carbonation nice flavor more like tangerine than orange and of the daily requirement for vitamin c when convenience is important the switch is a good healthier alternative to soda ,refreshing , not as good as it is
i really liked this drink it provides the pleasure of a carbonated beverage without the sickly sweet sticky feeling that drinking a soda leaves behind despite containing apple and grape juice it tastes mainly like the orange and tangerine it advertises if you are looking for a carbonated juice i would definitely suggest this i will be drinking it again ,great alternative to soda , great taste
refreshing orange juice drink with a good kick to it if you drink this first thing in the morning with breakfast it is sure to be a real eye opener it is a juice drink not soda pop but it is carbonated so it has the same bubbly zesty fizz the tangerine taste is better than switch black cherry i would definitely buy a whole case of this orange flavor highly recommended ,refreshing orange juice drink with a , not bad
if you want a quick pick me up that is not full of added sugar then this is a refreshing alternative to a soda the flavor is more heavily tangerine which only makes sense it is not overly sweet which is a good thing ,tasty for what it is not , not as good as it is
if you like a little fizz with your juice this is a good product tasty and refreshing however like all juice it is not low in calories so do not buy it expecting it to be more like a low cal fruit flavored drink ,tasty carbonated orange juice , great taste
i quit sodas over a year ago due to the of them i do however like bubbly drinks but i do not need the sugar or sodium that is why this product is perfect it is fruit juice carbonated for the br br orange is one of my favorite flavors this drink is the perfect drink br br i think this product is even better than orange soda orange soda is sticky but this product is not it has the perfect amount of which i love because it is fruit juice it also has the perfect amount of natural sweetness br br so this product is all the good things rolled into one br br fruit juice br no added sugar br bubbly br awesome orange flavor br br it so good it is hard to believe you are drinking something healthy ,tastes good and healthy and , not bad but not great
organic we need to remember that not everything in nature is good for every person there is still a nice chunk of calories here far more than water if you are allergic to citrus you should not drink this even though you might drink things like br br did it taste good oh yeah it did to me because i like tangerine and orange but it did also have a slightly sour after taste that was annoying easily solved with water since i do not normally drink carbonated beverages though i felt a bit off after drinking this as well br br this is not just juice and you should not make this a substitute for juice or fruit i do not doubt that it is slightly better for you thank other carbonated beverages though i think it would be better if they could cut some calories out as well ,not a fruit substitute , not bad but not bad
like izze the basic idea here is soda made with actual fruit juice no sugar no hfcs no preservatives no coloring just fruit juice concentrate and sparkling water fruits listed are apple grape tangerine orange and acerola whatever that is br br the can mentions contains soy at the end of the ingredients list there is no protein content listed so it must be a trace amount something to bear in mind if you have a soy allergy however br br flavor is fantastic i would have a hard time choosing between it and izze but i think i might just give switch the edge ,delicious , great taste
switch is a fun alternative to traditional soft drinks it is juice and all natural it contains no added sugar no corn syrup no preservatives and no artificial color what makes it fun is it is carbonated and just the right amount br br the first sip is perhaps a little tart or bitter but that is because most of us are used to soft drinks with added sugar corn syrup and a bunch of largely chemical switch has none of that and although different from traditional soft drinks the taste is very refreshing the carbonation makes it a fun drink that you can feel good about consuming it has of the recommended allowance of vitamin c br br should coke and pepsi be worried probably not but it does taste good and it is actually good for you you should try it ,it is all juice and it is all fun , not as good as it is
beverage that is basically fruit juice that has been carbonated with no sweetners or preservatives added switch orange tangerine pretty much tasted to me like a can of orange crush or sunkist soda br br that is not a bad thing per se but it was not something i would pay a premium for if i were in the mood for orange soda presumably it is a little bit healthier than a straight soda but it is nothing special to taste and thus i will not go through the effort to seek it out br br on the other hand my year old daughter claimed to like it more than orange soda and in fact said that she felt she could taste the grape juice in it as with many juices even though it is orange flavored grape juice is a major ingredient so she would give it four stars ,tasted pretty much like orange soda , like the switch
this tastes like carbonated orange juice very tart it is very expensive compared to easier to find similar beverages if one had allergies or health issues it might be worth drinking ,it is tart , great
i sampled a can of switch orange tangerine and found it to be a tasty beverage as advertised it is a balance between juice and carbonated with a light carbonation so it does not taste like orange crush or fanta but not like orange gatorade either the oz can has calories with a carb sugar content but vitamin c and vit a it is marketed as juice coming mostly from filtered concentrates no sugar added no corn syrup no preservatives no artificial colors gluten free if you are concerned with all that most important is that it tastes good and i would try it again ,tasty orange flavored beverage , not as good as it is
mouth instead of a lot of carbonation you will not hear the contents fizz when you drink this stuff the orange tangerine flavor is a nice combo stronger in the tangerine flavor than orange though as someone who does not like any sugar in my drinks i found it to be a tad sweet though it is advertised as no sugar added but less than i expected br br i m not sure when you would drink this though it is a small can and i cannot imagine someone who drinks cans of soda drinking one of these instead especially at the price they charge for this are they thinking that this will replace a glass of orange juice first thing in the morning br br overall i think it is tasty and if someone offered me one i would take it but it is not something i would buy ,tasty but expensive , not bad
the switch orange tangerine gets kudos from me for not including added sugars and nasty ingredients found in some traditional sodas but as for flavor it leaves something to be desired the initial yummy tangerine flavor of the drink is great but after a few a strange after taste my mouth i found it difficult to drink the whole can ,not that great , great taste
my year old daughter thought it was good tasted like pop but only drank of the can i thought it tasted like watered down orange soda with very little fizz with funny after taste it is suppose to be juice with vitamin c that has been carbonated ok here is my thought either buy orange juice that taste like it came right of the tree or buy a orange pop for me this product will not be off the shelves ,was not a hit at our house , not bad but not great
i really liked the taste of both this and one other flavor that we were able to order so i went on line to see what kind of pricing there was on it at only oz for about a dollar that is roughly the equivalent of for a single can if it was a full oz soft drink our budget is not going to justify purchases of this product if we had more money we might do it but it would be more of a treat than a regularly used product partly because of the small size so the taste was at least stars but the price brought it down considerably even the fact that the ingredients are far better than what is in most other soft drinks ,great taste but , good but not great
this orange soda is clearly more healthful and it tastes although somewhat less sweet than other orange sodas the one big drawback for me was that this drink lacks caffeine ,tangy less sweet , great
this is a mix of apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juices br br taste is obviously subjective and that can be seen in the reviews i like the flavor but will try to describe it rather than raving or about it br br the tangerine is the dominant flavor however it is the taste of a very ripe tangerine or perhaps a clementine there is that slight alcohol or medicinal overtone to an otherwise good flavor i could see people not liking it while other do br br each can has grams of sugar vitamin c and vitamin a and not much else these are not nutrients that are otherwise hard to get so this is not necessarily a healthy alternative to regular soda on some level e g producing fruit instead of sugar cane it might be attractive to some ,unique and pleasing taste , not as good as it is
alternative for those who love carbonated drinks but do not like some of the ingredients switch has attempted to address this concern and i feel it is a step in the right direct this is an orange tangerine flavored juice that is carbonated but without added sugar preservatives corn syrup or caffeine in other words this is about as natural as you can get without you know drinking real orange juice br br the can is also thinner then a soda can so you are not getting as much liquid as you would a pepsi or coke this means there is less fat in each can and the makers claim the product is free it does have a bit of a weird aftertaste but after a few sips it stops you while not a perfect drink it is one i enjoyed and will likely pick up again in the future ,great surprise , great taste
i have a tendency to avoid products with artificial sweeteners and this includes sodas with high fructose corn syrup the switch is a line of fruit juice sodas with no added sweeteners not even cane sugar it has carbonated water fruit juice some natural flavors and colors and vitamin c if you are going to drink soda carbonated fruit juice is the best way to go br br the switch has several flavors including orange tangerine however it is clear some flavors are better than others the orange tangerine has a harsh aftertaste that another flavor i tried does not i have tried other citrus juice sodas and enjoyed them but something went wrong in the flavoring of this particular soda if you are looking for an orangey soda try izze sparking clementine instead ,not my favorite , not bad but not great
this was a very interesting drink it was refreshing tasty and healthy it was very tangerine tasting no after taste and very refreshing ,tangerine juice soda , the best
this is a wonderful alternative to soda pop it is delicious refreshing and most of all natural i ordered the tangerine orange i am anxious to try the other flavors my only gripe is that the cans are rather small other than that it rocks ,refreshing natural , great taste
so i sampled this switch orange tangerine blend low on the carbonation high on the orange taste and worth every sip in gold plus healthy to boot give it a try and you may those brand names once and for all ,and is worth a try , great taste
i loved it good taste pleasant carbonation fun can br br ok so all it is is carbonated fruit juice big deal right but it actually is a big deal if you are a soda and want to cut down on the negative effects without losing all the experience i hate diet soda because it just does not taste right and has way too many synthetic chemicals in it however this drink has no sugar corn syrup or preservatives i suppose the co may not be the best for you but you gotta live a little ,i loved it , not as good as it is
described as an alternative to soda switch is a carbonated fruit drink made from natural juices although not necessarily the ones listed as the flavor made mostly out of apple and grape juice the switch orange tangerine does in fact have an orange tangerine flavor followed by a strong vitamin aftertaste it tasted like drinking a soda made from crushed vitamins br br want a better carbonated fruit drink pour half a glass of orange juice and add club soda ,not for me , not bad
this can of juice was delicious it reminded me of the orangina beverage i did find it strange that they chose to package this product in a can normally associated with energy drinks like red bull since they market it as all natural nevertheless it is yummy and i recommend it ,yummy and , great taste
the switch orange tangerine beverage is a mix of orange and tangerine juices with carbonated water and i must say it tastes amazing it is similar to soda but without all the unhealthy artificial ingredients and high fructose corn syrup if you find it buy it ,amazing fruit juice , great taste
i decided to try the switch orange tangerine because it was as a drink that is juice rda vitamin c all natural and it happens to be carbonated br br the taste is like drinking orange juice at first with carbonation and i have to be at first i wondered if it was an alcoholic beverage at first br br but after tasting it you do taste the combination of the orange tangerine and the carbonation br br the drink contains no sugar or corn syrup and no preservatives br br overall a tasty carbonated beverage with only calories and no fat mg of sodium and g of carbs br br if you are interested in the beverage that combines the taste of juice and carbonation give switch a try ,a of juice and juice no sugar no artificial flavors , not bad but not great
i a little when i read that this soda had no added sugar when i checked the label in the can since it already has of sugar anything more added and you will have sugar of whoever tries the drink the soda is tasty and quite fizzy i think it has more carbonation than fanta which goes flat easier the can is the typical size of an energy drink but this is not an energy drink merely another fruit flavored soda it is flavored naturally but that is the only difference from regular soda type drinks ,and tasty but nothing special , not as good as it is
i enjoyed this drink it has good fizz and flavor ingredients include apple grade juices as the main fruit elements tangerine orange and acerola type of wild cherry round out the other fruit juices for my taste this is not citrusy enough i find an orangina to have better flavor but it is loaded with added sugars high fructose corn syrup is the second ingredient in orangina i also compare this to the izze version and the izze wins for flavor i think the health benefits of the switch or izze drinks outweigh the flavor differences though and if i was but one of these types of drinks i would not look at orangina again ,a good option , a great product
i love this flavor the best for it lightness but zesty and orange tanginess very refreshing taste and not over powering with no additives what a plus nice carry size but why should such a good thing be in such a small size good that the product is in a can recyclable there are other similar carbonated juice out there and this is definitely one that could compete with the low saturated market ,and tangy , great taste
orange tangerine switch is a crisp carbonated citrus beverage unlike its sugar laden switch does not leave a sticky film in your mouth after you have finished drinking it presumably because there is not any sugar added to the drink my only complaint is the price at about per can you do not get a whole lot of bang for your buck especially since you can get a oz can of regular soda for a much lower price i guess that is the price you pay for something that is better for you ,delicious , great taste
to say the least the best so far is izze with its fruit juice and carbonated water no added sugars br br now comes along the switch the switch is fruit juice with carbonation added and like izze i really like this drink it is different than izze drinks the switch blends their juices different to achieve a little more subtle flavor where izze has more tang and punch i cannot say one is better than the other only that they each deliver a different refreshing experience br br i have tried the switch in orange tangerine and black cherry the orange tangerine is very good i highly recommend it the black cherry is good better than some other cherry drinks of this sort i have had but it could be a bit better it does not quite deliver the same flavor experience of a really good black cherry soda ,great alternative to high corn syrup , great product but
and aroma the switch blend is as flavorful as a href http www amazon com gp product b sparkling tangerine juice a or a href http www amazon com gp product b l san pellegrino orange a although again it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands br br in summary these all natural juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda the switch also can help break up the of drinking plain water and or juice after a workout remember to keep them the cans ice cold though preferably serve them on the rocks br br btw if you are looking for a full flavored black cherry soda try a href http www amazon com gp product b p y black cherry soda a which has calories per bottle there is a low calorie version as well but it is not available on amazon ,tasty after or up a lunch juice bad stuff , not bad
according to the side of the can it is juice with a balance on the carbonation it tastes great if not for the chalky aftertaste the low carbonation made it feel less of a soda and more of a juice i probably would not buy it in the store because of the weird taste ,low juice , not as good as it is
and you will have a pretty good idea what this tastes like the tangerine and or the added flavoring provides a nice tang to the flavor i found it to be quite tasty and refreshing i am not sure why they are packaging it in the small oz energy drink size cans unless it is to keep the calories per serving down at cal can it certainly is not low cal but there is no added hfcs high fructose corn syrup or sugar the surprisingly high price is also a downside true real juice is a lot more expensive than water and hfcs but at this price i will give it a pass br br pros br good taste not too carbonated br br cons br small can expensive fairly high calorie oz ,think a slightly , not as good as it is
overall this is a nice light refreshing drink the sweetness is a bit sweeter than juice squeeze but not as sweet as hansen soda i tried two flavors this orange tangerine and the strawberry watermelon i preferred this orange one the flavor was cleaner but there are so many different juices in both those drinks it gets i think i prefer juice squeeze because the flavor seems true er my year old daughter prefers hansen because it is a bit sweeter but like i said overall this is a very nice drink no corn syrup ,light and refreshing , great taste
well this drink was surprisingly tasty the reason it was surprising because there is no sugar added it is juice carbonated it was like drinking a soda but it was a drink of juice that is carbonated this would be a good drink if you want a healthy drink that is carbonated br br now i am curious about the other flavors to see if they taste better however i do have to say if you are expecting something extremely sweet this is not the drink to get you may want to go buy kool aid for that this drink has a natural taste to it i can actually taste the mixture of orange and tangerine i wish the tangerine flavor was stronger because i like tangerine more than orange but considering the fact that there is no sugar it is a good drink ,surprisingly tasty , not bad but not bad
i like the idea of a healthy soda type drink but this flavor just missed the mark the tangerine overpowered the orange and left a bad taste in my mouth carbonated juice is a great idea they just need to the flavors a bit br br the switch drinks from best to worst br br watermelon strawberry br kiwi berry br black cherry br orange tangerine ,my least favorite of the i tried , not as good as it is
the can says it is juice but the taste is powdery if you have ever had a glass of kool aid or crystal light you will know what i mean br br so there is that from powder taste also there is an aftertaste and all comes in a can the size of a red bull for calories br br i did not like it ,not so good , not as good as it is
this is a nice light refreshing carbonated fruit juice it is something like orangina but far more natural tasting which makes sense because unlike orangina it is all juice and has no added sweetener br br my only complaint is that the ounce can is rather small i generally prefer a larger drink it is definitely not a bargain if you have to drink two cans at a time ,delicious , great taste
i love the taste of this soda it is sweet with no bitter aftertaste that can be found in some orange sodas i would never guess this was a natural drink from the taste alone br br my only complaint would be the serving size it is correct for a serving size but not what i am used to in a soda can oz ,great taste , great taste
perhaps you have tried crystal fruit squeeze beverages which are also similar it is definitely not comparable to artificially flavored orange beverages sunkist crush it has a hint of grapefruit like taste to it but without the bitterness which may be due to the added apple grape and acerola concentrates the aftertaste is a bit metallic to me the beverage itself is clear without pulp of any kind and is light orange yellow in color br br this is a good alternative to those looking for something soda like but healthier than all the hfcs loaded options maybe it is a good option for parents to give to their kids if their kids drink a lot of soda anyway personally i do not enjoy it enough to buy it instead of other available similar products if i want orange juice or crave soda i will rather drink the real thing ,not good enough for me to make the switch , not bad but not as good as the price
natural flavors and colors are added and no gluten br br the orange tangerine flavor seemed to taste almost like carbonated sunny delight according to the label the juice flavors are apple grape tangerine orange and acerola it was quite tasty and had just the right amount of carbonation almost like a soda that has been opened and left to sit for just a few minutes to let some of the excess gas escape it was light and dare i say refreshing for what it is marketed to be it does quite well br br the only downside is that i could probably do something similar at home buy some sunny d and add some sparkling water or seltzer and it would probably be cheaper however if you are out and about and need something light tasty and not loaded full of extra then this would certainly fit the bill ,light and tasty beverage with no , great product
this carbonated product has a nice natural juice taste to it that makes you feel like you are drinking something that might be a little healthier than all the other carbonated stuff out there on the shelves but i could not help but notice the amount of sugar this thing has listed on the nutrition facts br br g per oz can of the stuff g total carbs br br like i said it is good but do not get fooled into thinking its any healthier for you there is no artificial stuff in here according to the can at least ,tastes good but , not as good as it is
ml br servings br br calories br fat g br sodium mg br total carb g sugar g br protein g br br vitamin c rda br vitamin a br br ingredients juice filtered spring water sufficient to reconstitute concentrates apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juice concentrates gum acacia natural flavors and colors ascorbic acid vitamin c contains soy br br compared to soda it is healthier in that it does not contain added sugars or corn syrup but it still has a bunch of calories eating fruits whole is better than juice but if you want a quick soda like pick me up and you love orange soda i would recommend this product over regular soda br br i gave this product stars because i do not think it really is that healthy but is a decent alternative to regular soda also the taste was ok nothing remarkable ,of regular orange soda , not bad but not as good as the
taste is good enough to maybe purchase a pack of this sugar free juice carbonated orange tangerine flavored drink with more folks like myself these days seeking out sugarless soft drinks this switch product is actually quite good i thought easy and small enough to carry might want to bring two ideal for a summer night at a theater in the park event friend outdoor bar b que kids game etc ,switch orange tangerine ounce can , a great product
i am diabetic so i am always looking for natural flavorful drinks without a lot of added sugar switch fits the bill for me it is lightly carbonated much less than a regular soda the fruit flavor is very natural br br the orange tangerine tasted primarily like orange at first but then i noticed a distinct tangerine aftertaste the drink actually tasted very much like the i had the day before excellent br br the can is also smaller than a regular soda can that is okay with me it is fine for a light drink when i am thirsty a full can of soda is sometimes a bit too much br br switch will probably become one of my drink alternatives and i am looking forward to trying the other flavors ,great fruit drink , a great product
soda to say the least this is not enough liquid for me in one sitting i need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so i was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up br br the taste of the drink itself was satisfying since there is no added sugar which is usually corn syrup in the us the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland however it was not anything like drinking a fresh bottle of natural juice more on the side of mixed syrup with water br br what kills this product is the high price product right now comes out to about a buck a can i would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk it is an insult to say the least not worth the money ,decent tasting but too small and overpriced , a great product
the taste reminded me of orange juice that went sour you know when the o j has gone way past the expiration date and you some and it has that bitter acidic taste br br anyway the soda is made from a combination of apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juice and does not add sugar corn syrup preservatives or artificial colors it is also gluten free so that is good news for those who are trying to watch what they eat and drink br br the ounce can is smaller than the standard ounce can of soda and maybe it just takes a couple of tries to get used to the flavor br br like i said not bad but i will stick with regular diet soda but for a healthier alternative for soda lovers i suggest trying one of the switch sodas or any naturally flavored sparkling water ,odd tasting but natural , not bad but not bad
this does not have that bold pop to it as other carbonated beverages have i have had mineral water with more bite br br but the worse part about this good for me drink is in in at calories the same as a regular can of coke and g sugar compared with coke at br br on the up side it has less than half the sodium as many regular and does deliver vit c and vit a but if i wanted those kind of health benefits i would rather take them directly from the source an orange br br overall the all natural health pros of switch orange tangerine simply do not justify the high calorie and carb count the switch beverage co may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas ,not so bold soda alternative , not bad
i like carbonated fruit juices and i think this one is fine it has a more tangy formula than the name suggests it is more of a light fruit punch it is refreshing and a good serving size in my opinion it is wonderful to have something that does not contain high fructose corn syrup what is here instead is juice filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juice concentrates gum acacia natural flavors and colors ascorbic acid vitamin c contains soy delicious sweet light fruity tangy yum ,tangy orange y stuff yum , a great product
sometimes if too many flavors are mixed together the result tastes like none of them this does not taste like orange or tangerine it tastes to me at least very sweet and sort of orangy but not tart at all and i like my citrus type sodas to be tart and sort of sour br br still great for those who are trying to get away from the high fructose corn syrup diet ,i wish it were either orange or tangerine , not as good as it is
i have not seen this brand in cans before how exciting i know this brand can be hard to find at the store so it is nice to see it being sold here at amazon i am a big fan of juice that has been lightly carbonated and have tried the few brands that are available and switch is one of my favorites my biggest beef with the brand is that it is just super hard to find which has now been resolved i have to say that i do not love the orange tangerine flavor which is why i gave it four stars instead of five i just do not really like orange flavored drinks but did like how this one had more tangerine flavor than straight up orange i would recommend this brand ,very tasty natural soda , not bad but not great
i was really looking forward to sampling this product it is not bad but a little too sweet tasting for me also at calories for an oz can i thought that was on the high end but it does contain grams of sugar and one must remember that fruit juice is not low in calories i would have preferred more sparkling water and less juice on the plus side it has no artificial ingredients or colors and no corn syrup i am sure many will like this product more than i especially those who prefer more sweetness in their beverages ,i wanted to like it more , not as good as it is
this ounce can of carbonated beverage is tangy and tasty and the size can means that you are drinking a smaller serving than an ordinary can of soda but although it is juice it still packs quite the calorie punch one can is calories which is almost exactly the same as in a oz can of regular coca cola so it may be slightly healthier than drinking coke since it has no caffeine or high fructose corn syrup and it has of your requirement of vitamin c but it is not going to make you as slim and attractive as the packaging ,tasty but , not as good as it is
i drank this and could tell very little difference from a regular orange tangerine flavored soda which is quite impressive considering that this drink is made from juice it has calories and a great alternative to a regular soda i will definitely be purchasing these in the future i also tried their kiwi strawberry carbonated juice and enjoyed it as well ,tastes almost like a regular orange tangerine soda , great taste
the things i like about this product are the smaller can size oz which makes it a more appropriate serving that a regular soda i also like the bright packaging and the pleasant taste after reading the ingredients of switch carefully i see that it is all juice just as it claims so its probably a better choice than a regular soda br br this product has no added sugars just as advertised on the can but buyer beware its still kind of high in sugar because fruit juices are naturally high in sugar as always be sure to read the label if you are concerned about sugar levels br br overall i think this product is a good size and has a pleasant taste especially if you are looking for something that tastes like an orange juice blend traditional orange soda fans might be slightly disappointed in the taste ,orange tangerine switch , switch to be the
i have a big sweet tooth and thought i would really like this but it was too sweet even for me i even tried adding water but that did not help i have not tried any of the other flavors so i cannot comment on the brand in general but i will never try this flavor again ,too sweet for this sugar , not as good as it is
if you think this is going to be a healthy product you are sadly mistaken it still contains g of sugar per can if you want to end up a fat diabetic by all means try it otherwise try the zero calorie zero sugar zero chemical naturally fruit flavored like those by la ,g of sugar still there , not as good as it is
dare i be corny and say make a switch to the switch this soda has a great orange tangerine taste it is juice with carbonation therefore it can tout that it is all natural without any added sugars it lacks that sickly sweet taste that soda with high fructose corn syrup tends to have which is a bonus br br this can at oz is following the skinny can trend as well which i think is great for packing in a cooler your bag or a picnic basket i would put these out at a party as well for mixed drinks self service and sake of ease ,yummy , great taste
this had a nice citrus flavor but it was too sweet and actually flat i did not get any kind of fizz or sparkle for the amount of sugar and calories i rather would have eaten a piece of fruit and drank a glass of seltzer water less calories and more satisfying in my mouth i got this on special for about for the case i do not think i will purchase again ,would not switch , not as good as it is
i liked the level of carbonation it was actually more highly carbonated than i was expecting but did not taste dry the way i would expect an artificial sugar free drink to taste with carbonation added i was hoping it would taste more orangey but the tangerine is the more dominant flavor along with apple a common juice filler despite having no added sugar however there is still grams worth of it in the small oz can basically other than having of the daily value of vitamin c this drink could easily be replaced with a better tasting orange soda that is in a oz can and costs far less unless you really like the taste or you want to ensure your vitamin c beverage stays fresh longer i would give this one a pass ,you really want vitamin c in your soda not really worth it , not as good as it is
after the corporate challenge road race in boston they were handing these out at the finish line not only was i able to try the tangerine which i got from amazon i was also able to try a few of the flavors they were all really delicious they were not heavy like a lot of sodas and you could taste the real fruit ingredients instead of the usual artificial flavorings the tangerine was especially good it was crisp tart and refreshing and actually made for a nice recovery drink after the race to get some carbs back into the system my only complaint is that oz left me wanting more like a oz can very good ,delicious , not as good as i like
a good drink about ww points i mean it is about what you would expect from an orange soda expect it is all natural so you recognize the things on the ingredient label br br downside really a lot of calories for such a small can ,yummy , great taste
the logo on the can states of what you do not want but that is not quite true it is quite tasty but loaded with calories br br next time they need to leave out the sugar as well br br also this drink is not readily available ,they need to out the sugar , not as good as it is
i have tried other flavors of switch carbonated juice drinks and have enjoyed them however this particular flavor of orange tangerine was way too sweet i felt like i was drinking some sort of carbonated orange drink and could barely get it down while i would probably purchase the other flavors of switch i definitely would not purchase this one ,too sweet , great taste
the advantage of making it easier to offer in regular beverage vending machines or oz bottles would also work the second issue is the price while i understand there is a huge difference between the cost of real juice and artificially flavored corn syrup the current price still seems high even in comparison to other juice drinks that might be partly because it is from a relatively small company that does not yet have the giant of scale that the likes of coke and pepsi can take advantage of but it still seems like the price could come down a bit or at least serving size could increase without a price increase and it could perhaps still be made back up in increased sales volume br i pick up when i can find it and i will likely do the same with the switch at least from time to time ,very good could be a bit better , a great product
i was anxious to try this but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me it has a very sharp harsh citrus y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for after awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage br br the can is small at oz a regular sized pop can is oz and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit br br i also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop it still has loads of sugar in it so when they claim no additional sugar this may lead you to believe no sugar or low sugar but it does in fact have grams ,very too sweet flavor , good but not as good as i like
this drink tastes just like soda to me very strong and sweetened soda it reminds me a lot of fanta back in the day s i know it says it has all these vitamins and that it is healthy but the flavor and amount of calories would keep me from buying this drink as a health drink there are plenty of vitamin and flavored waters and sports drinks that would serve the same purpose without all those calories if i want a soda i certainly would not pay a lot of money for something that tastes just like it but costs times as much at a guess i do love the taste of fanta though ,extra sweet and very carbonated , not as good as it is
second can of the switch that i am reviewing under the amazon vine program and while this one is perhaps a bit better it still has the same basic issues it is over priced at almost for a oz can in a pack but more importantly it really just does not taste like orange or tangerine at all the ingredients actually list apple juice as the first type now why would you put apple juice in an orange drink now do not get me wrong it tastes exactly like one would expect carbonated juice to taste but the flavor is not all that appealing br br i love orange juice drink it every day i would love to try carbonated orange juice but this is far from that it might be a good substitute for normal soda for kids but i cannot imagine any other real reason to get this ,well it is better than the black cherry , not bad but not bad
this product with my wife i know this drink apparently also contains the conversation starter bonus points for that i suppose she was like this sounds great is it like those a href http www amazon com gp product b izze pomegranate sparkling juice drink a i responded um i guess so br br i then also looked up the price and learned that i had the price of a single can being just over a single dollar despite my wanting to hate this product i have decided to step out of my anti culture box view this product for what it is and give it a middle rating of stars br br i can see the attraction i can see the appeal i just will not ever buy it i will stick to my glass of orange juice and tang any day br br good drinking br br j ,not my thing but you enjoy , not the best
i really enjoyed this drink it tasted just like an orange soda but i liked it more because it was juice and did not have any extra additives br br the only negative is that since it is juice and has no artificial sweeteners it is high in calories calories to a can to be exact br br however if i were to choose between drinking this or drinking an apple or orange juice i definitely would drink this as a treat plus it would be really fun to pack in a cooler especially for the young ones in your family br br please note it is not just a single type of juice it is a blend of several juices so it is not carbonated oj it is something just a little different ,this is really good if you like juice , not as good as it is
it is not bad i will not be asking for it at a bar but it gets the fruity flavor with the coconut rum and i think if someone was creative this could be a match made in heaven br br the down side to me is this is another fairly pricey drink the cans are not full size cans either so for almost per can you get a smallish ounces but with regular sodas you get ounces half again as much of course sodas are not juice either br br is if i am on a beach somewhere and hot and thirsty i would probably buy this for stocking at home i will stick with regular frozen orange juice or orange juice in a carton i would recommend trying it for yourself though this seems to be one of those drinks that could pretty hard depending on personal preferences ,much better than regular soda , not bad
like many others i found the switch orange tangerine to be a little hard to it is not too sweet and not too tart with a lot of flavor but it distinctly tastes blended creating a real flavor by playing with others br br it does not really claim to be healthy it just it in a number of ways on the other hand it is not too overly sweet like a typical soda and i found the carbonation was just about right br br bottom line it is fairly tasty but the small size for the price is a downside ,interesting switch from soda , not as good as it is
i suspect this drink is an acquired taste after the first sip i was reluctant to take another the second sip was an improvement and the third even more so by the end of the can i was finding it fairly enjoyable br br it was only after i had finished that i noted the seltzer like yuck br br still i am sure i could get used to it after a few more tries this is i think the problem with the drink i would drink it because it presents itself as being good for me not because i was blown away with taste or a feeling of refreshment br br i would not buy it again ,like after taste , not as good as it is
i am very fond of citrus drinks to begin with so maybe i am biased br br but what i liked most about this was it was not too sweet and it is all natural and it has a real citrus taste not a one br br love it ,i loved this drink , not as good as it is
i was pleased to discover that switch orange tangerine is actually quite tasty more please to find out that it contains no sugar corn syrup or artificial flavors what it does have is several healthy ingredients i highly recommend it ,the best yet , great taste
of them but i was feeling kind of thirsty so i ordered a can from the vine program it is an ounce can of carbonated juice plus gum acacia natural flavors and colors acid and soy i do not know what to think about some of the ingredients but i certainly do know that i like that it is only ounces and that it has no corn syrup br br it tastes very similar to canned minute maid drinks especially the orange offering but does have a slightly sickly sweet aftertaste i do not know if i would run out and buy a pack but if i saw this in a restaurant i would definitely consider it as a tasty complement to a sandwich and potato chip lunch br br the last thing i like is about the company it seems to be an owned shop and i like that ,a solid juice , not bad
very refreshing ingredients are different fruit juices sparkling water and no sugar about calories per can and they are smaller than regular soda cans so the ingredients are pretty natural but calories might be too much for some people ,very refreshing , great taste
of what you want of what you do not is upon the can that contains switch orange tangerine carbonated juice it certainly tasted all natural as there was not too much taste really br br don t get me wrong it was all right but i would say it tasted kind of like sprite with a couple of orange flavored tossed in another note is that it is rather small at only just over ounces however it still had enough orange taste i suppose so if you want an all natural mild orange flavored carbonated juice drink then you have just hit the jack pot br br if not you may want to pass this up mildly recommended ,switch orange , not as good as it is
juices in it to sweeten it i would say the makers of this drink went on the apple grape combo not just in the flavor department but in the sweetness it is sticky icky sweet more than any of the cheaper brands sunkist crush and others of orange soda or the higher priced goodies like orangina and the delectable izze br br it is fairly healthy however with no bad stuff and quite a lot of vitamin c based on calorie intake all natural etc my recommendation is for more orange less apple grape or change the label flavor to mixed fruit it is calories per cute little oz can and if you are not expecting orange you may like it so far the taste winner for cute little cans for me is izze grapefruit which has the perfect balance of flavor and carbonation with the right amount of sweetness ,sweet fruity , not bad but not bad
here for me if i want of what i want i will buy a few oranges and some seltzer water if i want of what you do not want well why buy it br br this is a time when we had better look pretty closely at what is an convenience and what is a necessity and how to find a happy medium i consider the likes of pellegrino orangina and izze a luxury and when i indulge it is a true delight br br switch is a product that is not better tasting proven healthier or even less expensive than any of many other alternatives once again marketing is driving product creation and design and that is a concept br br if you want a similar taste experience for about the same price pick up some seltzer cold plus you will stop and and get a great night sleep ,i would than switch , not as good as it is
also have acerola in them br br though the can is appealing and fine this beverage is good enough to deserve a bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues do not get me started on the of heavy of health issues i have a book in to be published on kindle which will with steam hissing out of kindle ears at no extra charge i ll add a comment to this review about why i had quit drinking soda pops which will explain why i will be happily able to welcome switch into my diet br br my thanks to the switch for providing a healthy gourmet quality drink without thank god soybeans added br br i m hooked br br linda br of several kindle books and amazon br br p s br with and i have had to add comment here ,a wish for guilt free flavor , great product
the drink is juice concentrate reconstituted with carbonated water it tastes like a cross between a href http www amazon com gp product b orangina sparkling citrus beverage with natural pulp cans a and the orange drink from mcdonalds br br it was refreshing at first but the aftertaste is and almost chemically it is odd because the drink does not have any unnatural flavors according to the ingredients list if the end flavor was more natural i would definitely buy it again ,refreshing but has aftertaste , not as good as it is
percent of the for vitamin c and twenty percent of the for vitamin a there is no fat and no protein either but there are thirty four grams of sugars and a fairly high level of calories granted these are natural sugars but thirty four grams is still a large amount and it will not be acceptable to those on low carb diets and with almost calories per ounce the caloric content is higher than that of most soft drinks br br so are there enough reasons to make the switch to the switch orange tangerine my answer is yes due to both its good refreshing taste and its better than average nutritional content it is not the greatest tasting orange beverage i have ever tried and it is more expensive than most other drinks including regular orange juice but it does have enough positive points to it a recommendation ,make the switch to a healthier beverage , not bad but not as good as it is
sorry but i just do not get it you pay almost a buck for oz just over a cup of carbonated water and fruit juice concentrate fyi the first one listed on the can is apple then grape then tangerine then orange the taste is fine but personally i would much rather have a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice for a lot less the can is small and like an energy drink but there is nothing in this to give you a boost fyi there are calories in one can if you have the to spend then yes it is a tasty beverage but it is simply not a good value in my book ,what is it all about , not bad but not great
pros not overly sweet like some juice drinks br no caffeine br no corn sweeteners if that matters to you br cons expensive for the size ounces br cannot taste the orange or tangerine juices in it br lots of calories br br i grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my trees i was surprised that i could not taste those flavors in this drink but then i looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts probably to keep the cost down br br i ll stick to the low cal drinks and the calorie vitamin water because they are cheaper and i would rather save up my daily of calories for something with more flavor ,i had high am a bit disappointed , not as good as it is
this is not orange and tangerine juice it is mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine and i really do not care about the vitamin c content vitamin c is easy to get br br what i do care about is that this is definitely the worst tasting soda of any type that i have ever tried i could not pour it down the drain fast enough ,tastes like , great taste
i realize that it is not quite healthy to oz canisters of liquid at a sitting but this switch orange tangerine flavored drink was so light and refreshing and tasted so natural that i could easily have another oz can or two and that is the only reason this drink did not receive five stars i wanted more and the little can was just not enough it is the perfect size for a child however so perhaps that who the drink is for as an aside for those who prefer their beverages more adult this orange tangerine switch would make an awesome mixer with or vodka cheers ,a of tangerine taste in a can , a little juice
expecting something like fanta or sunkist i was surprised how smooth and subtle switch is definitely a good combination of refreshment and flavor love the fact that it does not tast too carbonated ,smooth flavor , not as good as
i tried the black cherry version and liked it but this one is much better great orange taste plus the benefit of juice and no corn syrup sweetner for those worried about its use the carbonation helps make it a satisfying drink to quench thirst and the knowledge that it is healthy satisfies the mind as well ,super satisfying taste , delicious
of the daily recommended vitamin a the lack of artificial preservatives does also give it a slightly more crisp taste br br it important to note that switch is not sugar free but rather has no sugar added the is missed by many and could be very important for diabetics or anyone watching their sugar intake the drink actually has grams of sugar in each can but since it is coming from the fruit juice and not from high fructose corn syrup it is less of a problem for anyone looking for a more healthy drink br br the biggest factor in deciding if switch will be worthy anyone time depends entirely on how much they enjoy carbonated citrus drinks soda fans who want a and less artificial drink will probably love switch people who just want fruit juice and do not enjoy the carbonated flavor should probably avoid however ,a decent carbonated fruit drink that a healthier alternative to soda , not bad but not as good as it is
in fact i did not like the artificial taste in this orange drink the degree of carbonation is alright and it does have an orangey taste to it but i cannot ignore the artificial taste that accompanies this beverage for now i would stick with plain orange juice or other orange sodas like crush ,nothing great about this , not as good as it is
i grew up on orange sodas and thought this might be like a healthy crush that would be a no of course tangerine has a bit of a different taste than orange as it is that much sweeter adding the carbonation to it just made it an unappealing fizzy ultra sweet drink not unlike cough syrup proceed with caution perhaps kids would find it super tasty ,too sweet , not bad
as the title of my review indicates this product is nothing special in terms of taste granted it is missing some of the soda pop bad guys high fructose syrup and coloring but the taste is mediocre this is not something you are going to rave about because of the taste if you are a health food you might overlook the bland middle of the road taste contrary to some reviews i did not find the drink exceptionally sweet but than again everyone has different taste buds i am not a soda pop drinker so that might have some influence on my less than enthusiastic endorsement i was switched off will this make you give up your favorite soda pop probably not i like the idea of homemade soda water infused juice for that drink better than switch not such a great product in my opinion ,nothing special , not as good as it is
the taste says fresh squeezed quality fruit the carbonation content is lower than some drinks of this variety this ratio makes for a heavier juice drink though a delicious treat especially with breakfast on the i prefer to save a few calories per can and have more carbonation ,refreshing , great product
the switch orange tangerine looked very juice with some zippy carbonation i placed it in the fridge and let it get a nice chill hours later i popped the top and my wife and i sampled br br and it tasted like drinking furniture polish it is not like we we are searching for about switch here is how the conversation went br br wife takes a looks at me with eyes all googled yuck it tastes like furniture polish br br i take the can from her thinking she must be insane i some down yeah it does taste like furniture polish br br we poured the remainder down the drain if you enjoy drinking cold tangerine flavored furniture polish by all means br br btw this drink left a nasty aftertaste still it up ,with an aftertaste , great taste
i did not like this drink at all it had a very strange almost chemically taste to it i also did not appreciate switch marketing itself as all natural but had ingredients like natural flavors and colors what are they are they even natural i even let my three year old try it but she could not even swallow it and spit it out in the sink too bad it would have been a good alternative to sodas but not with this horrible taste my daughter and i much prefer the ooba hibiscus drink ,yuck , not as good as it is
as advertised this product puts only a small amount of carbonation in the drink the taste is similar to orangina but with a much more pronounced juice taste and mouth feel it actually leaves a thick taste in your mouth similar to when you drink orange juice from concentrate it is a bit high in sugar but at least it is natural fructose sugar from the fruits again similar to real orange juice as there are no added sugars certainly not a calories conscience drink but not bad i do think the can is way too small but then again any more and the sugars and calories really ,very like , not bad but not great
it is basically carbonated fruit juice but it is heavier on the juice than a similar drink like the latter seems to never hit the spot this drink is a great balance of fresh fruit taste the right amount of bubbles and something like zing very refreshing and tasty br br highly recommended ,surprisingly good , great taste
juice like most of these juices drinks the ingredients state juice in this order filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juice concentrates gum natural flavors and colors ascorbic acid vitamin c and soy i was very surprised that this taste like a great tangerine soda each can has calories thanks i am from mg of sodium g of carbohydrates g of sugar and of rda of vitamin c and of vitamin a br br i would be pleased to drink this sparkling orange tangerine flavored juice again i found it to taste good and be a refreshing drink but for my money i would rather by the a href http www amazon com gp product b x o c izze fortified sparkling juice clementine ounce cans pack of a brand of fortified sparkling juice that has a cleaner taste and fewer calories ,taste as advertised , orange orange orange soda
corn syrup and fruit juice instead of chemicals switch ingredients are filtered water apple grape tangerine orange and acerola juice concentrates gum acacia natural flavors and colors and ascorbic acid vitamin c it also says it contains soy so avoid it if you are allergic to soy one can contains vitamin c and vitamin a it also contains grams of sugar and it tastes like it br br the taste of switch is very similar to regular orange soda which includes the syrupy taste that orange soda has i personally do not like the syrupy taste and think this is way too sweet i can see kid liking the taste however and it is a much better alternative to regular orange soda grams of sugar is a lot for ounces of a drink i would avoid it for myself but may use it as an occasional substitute for my kids ,soda substitute that tastes to the original , not bad
this tangerine soda reminds me a lot of the drink called orangina but with a pronounced tangerine flavor br it is basically an all natural carbonated juice it is very refreshing and pleasant tasting over all i like it a lot ,all natural , great taste
four people in my family tasted this orange tangerine drink it tasted good to all four people and from all four is difficult it does not taste like a soft drink but much better if you are looking for a that is tart this is your drink ,little drink , the best
switch tastes more like chemicals than juice i was expecting something along the lines of orangina instead it is closer to orange soda but without the carbonation level that makes orange soda enjoyable for a small drink oz it is pretty high in calories frankly i do not think the flavor is good enough to justify the caloric level br br bottom line if you are die hard soda drinker this might be a better option for you if you are a die hard juice drinker stick to juice if you want fizzy juice add a little seltzer to your fruit juice ,tastes like , a great product
i know tang when i taste it this is carbonated tang i know it is somewhere out there is a giant warehouse filled with of powdered tang and someone thought to themselves what do we do with all of this stuff i know mix it with carbonated water and voila now it is not tang it is switch br br in all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can i would suggest whipping up your own tang with fizzy water br br pros pretty much all natural juices natural flavors and no unnatural good for the kids br br cons i personally did not care at all for the taste a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink ,switch to my bad man , a great product
overall the drink was decent it is tart and sweet at the same time switch is alright but might not be worth the money depending on how much you like it i myself would prefer a spicy v over this it might be a good substitute for some who do not want to drink as much soda but for me i will just stick with the v and the occasional soda ,interesting better than , not as good as it is
this product has a nice smooth taste with the additional tanginess of tangerine br it also has a little bit of a sweetness to it but syrupy sweet br not lingering or noticeable aftertaste ,a nice alternative to soda , not as good as it is
this orange tangerine juice bills itself as having of what you want and of what you do not want it is pure orange and tangerine juice with a bit of carbonation but no added sugar preservatives and carbonation br br of course that is all great but the big question is how it tastes i am pleased to be able to say it tastes pretty good it has a bit less zip than i usually prefer in my orange soda but a nice orange tangerine flavor and no noticeable aftertaste i would definitely try this again if i had the chance ,tasty orange soda , a great product
when i first at this item my first thought was a orange type soft drink however it is made of fruit juice with carbonation added it tastes way too sweet for my taste buds much more than regular oj in fact it left an aftertaste in my mouth and i had to brush my teeth right after taste testing it br br i ended up mixing the rest with a shot of vodka and it made a great with a kick of carbonation ,not a soft drink more like carbonated orange juice , not as good as it is
i enjoyed the product very much i like that it is not overly sweet or heavy there is no aftertaste and it goes down smoothly with just enough carbonation to give it body br br the tangerine orange taste i found to be clean if you like something that is sweeter this might not be for you but if you enjoy the fruity taste with some carbonation it is quite nice i drank it chilled i do not think i would have enjoyed it at room temperature br br the price might keep me away almost a dollar per oz can is kind of tough br br four stars for taste and two stars for price three stars ,fresh light taste , not as good as it is
this is a very tasty and refreshing little drink one of the best orange drinks you will find anywhere i only wish it were bigger because it is that good ,excellent excellent excellent , great taste
this soda sounded like a good idea but it is just too sweet the orange and tangerine juice is clear and bitter tangy but the sugar in this particular flavor is overwhelming to me on the other hand i liked the cherry very much i would drink it anyway if it were offered it certainly is not terrible but i would not buy it again ,no corn syrup but way too sweet , great taste
i wrote a star review of the kiwi berry flavor that is not usually my favorite flavor of anything but it was surprisingly good br br orange tangerine which would generally be among my first of fruit flavored beverages is flat by comparison literally br br it seemed to lack the right amount of carbonation it also tastes weaker and too sweet br br try the kiwi berry instead ,i recommend other flavors instead , not as good as it is
i really enjoyed the switch it was a lot more carbonated than most sodas and stayed that way until i finished it i was also surprised that no sugar was added since it was sweet and had real crisp tangerine taste it was similar to sunkist pop but it tasted more like real juice i enjoyed the taste and if you have the extra money and want a healthier alternative you might want to give it a try but it is still calories per can so it is not exactly a diet drink and the price for the switch is about times the cost of most soft drinks so i think it would be out of the range for most people ,crisp and sweet drink but lots of calories and pricey , not as good as it is
now we are not big juice drinkers in this family we take apple juice or cherry juice and mix it with unflavored seltzer water because otherwise we find it too sweet this is the same it is nicely carbonated and it has a pretty authentic fruit taste but it is still too sickly sweet cut it half and half with unflavored seltzer and a little ice and you will be happy ,too sweet to drink , not as good as it is
ounces and a tad expensive is what i would say about this drink grams of sugar is also a negative for me i am not a sugar lover all in all not big enough to quench my thirst and not delicious enough to find me coming back for more natural but not that citrus ,small size and mediocre taste , not as good as it is
not a diet drink just because the can says no sugar added that does not mean that there is no sugar in it there happens to be a significant amount of sugar in this drink given the total volume you get can if i recall correctly the contents label said g of sugar that is because fruit juice is loaded with sugar sugar like fructose br br ok frankly the taste combo does not particularly appeal to me that is why i did not order the grape version of this product and now that i know what is in the orange tangerine i would not order it again br br i m torn between and stars though simply because it is not really an orange tangerine drink as advertized i guess i will have to go with stars i do not know why stars showed up for this product alas ,switch orange tangerine is and a bit overpriced and not a diet drink , not bad but not bad
i tried this along with two of my children and we all agreed that it tastes like spoiled oj but maybe it would be an acquired taste but i will not be drinking it again to find out br br oddly enough the black cherry version is quite good ,yuck , not as good as it is
i really enjoyed this drink the tangerine is very present and makes it very tasty this drink is natural and has no sugar added the carbonation makes it a bit like a soda but a lighter and healthier one br br i enjoyed it and i would definitely recommend it to others as an excellent alternative to regular soda ,very tasty natural drink , not as good as it is
pop the can and get from the orange scent br the taste is pure citrus bliss great flavor i would say the flavor is halfway between fresh orange juice and really good orange soda the tangerine is definitely present but mostly only as a very after taste br br love it ,excellent , great taste
good things come in small packages this is an excellent non soda thirst quencher no sugar but an outstanding taste ,excellent , great taste
how can tang be if you made it a bit watered down a bit more a bit less child friendly it is an all right soda but i do not feel the of drinking it that i did drinking tang as a child i cannot i am an with this sometimes advertising just helps ,ok soda like slightly in a can , not as good as it is
taste like tang only more expensive i am not a fan of tang if you love tang and want some convenience this just might be the drink for you ,not bad nothing special about it , not as good as
sadly i was supposed to receive this product but never did i imagine it is good given the others i have tried but alas that will not happen still i have to write a review so there you go ,never received the product , not as good as it is
the switch orange tangerine ounce can packs a big punch in a tiny can touted as a healthy alternative to soda i could not help but taste the between switch and coke fanta orange drink the difference however is more than plain switch is supposedly carbonated fruit juice with no added sugars it actually has a pretty good taste if it is all natural then i think kids would love it i liked the carbonation it had tons of bubbles and a light airy feel to it all in all i would buy this product again br br s for amazon vine ,not bad at all , not as good as it is
here is yet another carbonated juice drink comparable with ooba hibiscus with orange ounce bottle pack of a href http www amazon com gp product b x o c izze fortified sparkling juice clementine ounce cans pack of a this one however is an unusual combination of orange tangerine i did not really like the flavor much though i like both orange tangerine separately but the taste is in the s i prefer the izze of the as for the juice it is more apple grape than orange tangerine the vit c is the silly recommended dose to prevent not much really per true it does not have corn syrup sugar or substitutes which is nice but at close to oz it is equivalent to about for oz in a pack of small cans seems pricey to me why not just buy orange juice ,okay but , a great product
i thought it would have a clean crisp taste but it honestly tasted just like every other orange soda i have ever had maybe that is maybe they are people who would otherwise drink orange soda unless presented with a more natural alternative regardless it tastes exactly like carbonated reconstituted juice concentrates with some orange coloring thrown into the mix i e nothing special ,no , a little juice
of drink i e oz vs oz it would have much more the power of switch then is that it rda of vitamin c and rda of vitamin a vs in these for coke and that it has plenty of carbonation to satisfy the taste of soda lovers in my mind this does not quite balance the scale br br as to the second claim i liked the balance between a fruit juice and a carbonated drink it reminded me of orangina in that it is sharp and crisp and has a bite to it but it might some as too sugary sweet all in all i think this is likely to be one of those drinks that people like very much or no at all no in however it can be considered healty only in small doses one can day say and should be avoided by low carb dieters ,it is all in the , not bad but not bad
the only good thing was that it was not sweet but the taste was just bad i could understand and tolerate the taste if it was an energy drink but this is not an energy drink i have been very open and have tried different carbonated orange drinks and i have to say this is the least favorites of the other carbonated orange drinks i prefer just mixing carbonated water with orange juice ,did not taste great , not as good as it is
this product is tasty it is carbonated juice a blend of several juices mostly apple grape tangerine but the ounces costs and contains calories this is a little rich for me both and i would recommend this for someone who does not mind spending their money and calories on juice ,no sugar but not low calorie , great taste
orange tangerine sounded delicious when i ordered it i thought it would be very refreshing on these hot summer days and it would be if the taste were better perhaps the other flavors might be better but the orange tangerine had a bad aftertaste stick with the real juice if you want that flavor the sparkling juice idea is good i liked the carbonation as it was refreshing br br but the biggest drawback for me is the sugar there was g of sugar in that little oz can there is g in a oz can of dr pepper way too much sugar br br the other drawback for me is the price i would not buy it because it works out to be almost a dollar a can if i am going to pay that much i would rather buy the regular juice real not reconstituted in the store ,too much sugar too expensive , not bad but not as good as it is
this product is a light and fruity carbonated beverage you might ask how that is different from any other soda the difference is that this one more on the fruit side rather than the soda or sugar side i liked that about it while it was sweet it was not syrupy sweet to the point that it was and it did not have a strong after taste also it had a much more juicy aspect to it its kind of hard to describe but the best comparison i can make is it is like one of those fruity v juices only carbonated maybe that is not right either but i would recommend trying this at least once it just may be a taste you will find you will like again ,switch on , not as good as it is
the citrus flavor is crisp and clear in this carbonated juice it is not too sweet and the bonus of having no added hfcs or sugar is a winner the carbonation cuts the sweetness in a nice tart balance it is still high in calories like any juice is but i would definitely turn to this beverage over any of the manufactured sodas that contain added sugar hfcs or preservatives ,a nice change , not as good as it is
switch orange tangerine is ok but not what one might expect first of all there is more apple and grape juice in here than orange or tangerine this will not be a surprise if you are familiar with the other flavors as that is also true with them br br switch basically is carbonated juice the taste is not a bad and it is supposed to be healthier than soda which can be it is a reasonable drink for snacks but if you are going to need several if you are actually thirsty ,not bad , not bad
it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use but it is also known to cause diarrhea particularly in children br br so another drink on the hit of healthy drinks appealing to the concern for their ever growing and them that this will help continued growth br br you are better off drinking diet coke you would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories my favorite is in pomegranate lime lemon and orange flavors and is sold from time to time on amazon as well as your local supermarket br br better yet buy some organic pure fruit juice such as pomegranate and pour cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water at least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract ,healthy drink , this is the best
compared to your average oz bottle and roughly times the cost of cans when comparing equal amount by the ounce also read the ingredients it contains more apple and grape juice than orange or tangerine which means that the taste is probably aided by the natural flavors which does not mean oranges just that it was derived from natural not chemically made br br the the switch seems straight forward but it is also a little which leads me to my biggest complaint granted it is all natural but each oz can contains g of carbs of sugar alone that is more sugar than soda in some cases by almost grams a serving more sugar even if it is not corn syrup is more calories per can so even at it is single serving size you would almost be better off drinking a coke and taking a vitamin c pill ,it is all natural but that does not it is good for you , not bad but not bad
the carbonation in this drink was way too much so much in fact that it over powered the flavor orange tangerine is usually very good together i expect this from a soda but not a healthy drink lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink until then i will pass ,to much and not enough , not as good as it is
but it is almost larger so even without adding sugar this is a drink that is fully loaded in of the switch at least the sugar is natural with no high fructose corn syrup obviously it has no caffeine which i have some issues with so that is a plus over soda although at g of carbs it seems a bit high and calories is nothing to at br br so it cannot be considered a health drink since you can get lower sugar carbs and calories from a similar size glass of tropicana orange juice so how is the taste my wife described it as tasting like soap i would not go that far but i will say the despite its good ingredients it actually tasted artificial to me i was not a big fan and personally i am going to stick with water and orange juice and beer ,good ingredients weak taste , it was not bad
i was really surprised at the taste of the switch orange tangerine drink it reminds me of carbonated orange juice it is a little on the sweet side but not too bad in my opinion this is actually a beverage that i could drink all the time and not get tired of br br the best thing about switch is that it is healthy for you and it does not have any added sugars and it has a lot of vitamin c switch is a all natural beverage which is great you can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda br br if you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then i highly recommend switch if you like orange juice then i think you will really enjoy this the cans are a little on the smaller side though ,healthy drink that tastes great , not bad but not bad
taste good for sipping if you drink soda or juice with your meals this would be a decent alternative the tangerine taste is pronounced but not overpowering the carbonation is pleasant br br however it is not a drink i would normally i normally drink either water or beverages sweetened with something other than sugar and this has a load of sugar yes they say it has no added sugar that is probably accurate but the natural sugar in the apple tangerine orange juices in this drink adds up to grams compare that to the same amount of coke at grams i checked a few other tangerine flavored sodas they all had similar amounts of sugar as switch i suppose tangerines are loaded with sugar anyway that is a lot more sugar than i normally drink br br if the sugar is not an issue this is worth checking out ,good for a lot of sugar , tasty
i really enjoyed this drink i am a lover of both orange juice and sunkist type drinks so i was very eager to try this drink it is the perfect combination of sweet and fruity the tangerine i believe helps give the extra lift of the sweet taste if you are trying to cut back on pop i highly recommend this drink or even just for a refreshing treat ,sweet and refreshing , the best
fourth ingredient in this drink the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is up by a low level of carbonation i think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients tangerine is third is what results in the unpleasant orange taste finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail to my taste this stuff is unpalatable br br while the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is by the high level of completely natural sugar in this or most any juice the healthy to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you ,a orange flavor , not bad but not bad
i ordered this product after enjoying a previous vine a href http www amazon com gp product b izze sparkling clementine soda full case oz bottles a fully expecting to like it it appears that the use of juice in this product makes a big difference from the izze use of juice sparkling water i like izze but do not like switch much br br switch tastes and is just like orange juice except it is carbonated i do not think orange juice was meant to be carbonated it just does not add anything to the taste or consistency that i found enjoyable it also left a aftertaste of juice burps which i did not enjoy so it is not that the makes have done anything wrong or poor quality it is just that this reviewer did not like how the concept worked out ,some things were not to be carbonated , not bad but not great
i am a big fan of avoiding corn syrup and a lot of the other ingredients that go into most processed foods and beverages these days so this beverage idea really sounded good to me it does not contain a bunch of artificial junk in it and it still tastes pretty good i could definitely drink more of these they will not ever be my favorite beverage but then i am more of a non carbonated kind of drinker anyway this is definitely a good alternative to other products out there and i would like to try other flavors as well ,tasty alternative to the , not as good as it is
switch is a decent soda and definitely worth considering for those who want mainly natural ingredients but i think it is it a bit when the switch can claims of what you want and of what you do not want or is soy something i would expect or want in a soda br br for my personal taste this switch flavor which was the only one i tried was too sweet it is hard to believe that there is no sugar added to that stuff br br so ok but not great i prefer a href http www amazon com gp product b nu izze sparkling pomegranate soda pk ounce bottles a or any of the izze flavors over switch ,just a soda , a little juice
well my husband myself and my year old son sampled this drink my husband hated it i felt like it was ok but nothing to write home about the taste to me was too orangey and for a natural product it sure did not taste like one my year old liked it he also likes gummy worms and sour straws so you can take his review for what it is br br i personally would not buy this product br stars ,only so so , not as good as it is
orange juice and club soda packaged in a trendy little can br br and like all canned orange juice blue bird brand al there is an off taste to it that reminds you it is not fresh squeezed juice add to that this fizzy aspect and its just kinda well there br br i cannot say that this is a healthy drink orange juice has some of the highest of sugars for a fruit drink and its cost per can is steep especially when compared to making this stuff at home with club soda and fresh squeezed juice br br i cannot give it one star i would reserve that for something undrinkable as amazon requires a minimum one star to do a review so my two star rating should be taken to mean that you can drink it and its but thats about all you can say about it ,meh , great product
i highly recommend switch if you are looking for a soda that does not have refined sugar and is loaded with flavor sweetened with fruit juice as opposed to high fructose corn syrup this will definitely quench your thirst plus all you tangerine lovers out there this is the next best thing to eating the actual fruit ,a great soda , great taste
orange soda nor as orange juice for a disclaimer i will mention that orange juice is not something that would normally taste great carbonated so the other flavors of switch might taste better i got a kind of odd bitter taste as i drunk the soda but afterwards there was a pleasant aftertaste the bitterness might be present in regular soda but this is orange juice with some others mixed in and i know how it tastes without carbonation br br i gave the switch soda to both of my daughters who happily it down with no concern from the odd taste i noticed br br so while i will not be happily my occasional soda for switch i am glad they are trying to do something a little healthier than we can feel more comfortable giving our children and really on a hot day this would hit the spot ,going sugar water , a great juice
i really enjoy trying new things so i found the idea of this soda pleasing it is essentially carbonated fruit juice so it is naturally high in calories and thus comes in a small container that looks a lot like an energy drink i think this might some leading to negative reviews based on the wrong of what it is meant to be however i think a very complaint comes from some that feel this natural drink tastes a bit artificial this is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate which always effects the flavor however unlike the watermelon flavor i found this variety vibrant and delicious the fruit flavor really comes through including the often tricky tangerine it is an expensive treat but would make a fun addition to breakfast in lieu of a similarly high calorie cup of orange juice ,nice fruity flavor , the best
juice but it tastes like orange pop should taste if it really tasted like oranges my wife said it reminded her of minute maid orange pop or as she would call it orange soda br br our four year old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally but we generally do not let him after reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there is no added sugar corn syrup preservatives or artificial flavors i can admit that i would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally but not too often as it is quite a bit of sugar br br my wife made the that this drink would probably make a fantastic mixer for adult beverages sadly the sample we received was not enough to test this but it should make a really really good ,as from would say this is a tasty beverage , a great product
i gave this a try because i love carbonated juice stuff like bottled cranberry apple grape from and the like br br personally i liked this pretty well though not as much as some other brands to me it tastes and smells like tangerine and i felt like i could kind of taste some of the component flavors making it up the flavor is more complex than you would get from a fruit flavored soda the carbonation is pretty light br br i definitely would not mind trying some of the switch other flavors but i split some of the tangerine flavor with a relative and she thought it smelled like jell o and did not care for it she said she would rather have regular juice br br i definitely liked this better than orange soda though ,pretty good , not bad but not bad
switch is a great alternative to sodas for our family love them and i do not feel bad about the kids drinking them great variety of flavors i just wish they were more easily found in stores ,great alternative , great taste
we really have to limit additives and sugar for our son with autism switch orange tangerine really fills the bill he feels like he is getting real fizzy soda and mommy is happy it is not loaded with chemicals and additives and actually has real juice in it a total win win ,my son favorite soda , great taste
if you like your drink not so smooth and a bit tangy this should work for you but alas not for me ,tangy , not as good as
switch is a fantastic replacement for sodas you still enjoy having the carbonation but with fruit juice it is very satisfying ,great product , great product
seriously a great orange drink on par with orangina without being super crazy sweet i have purchased this frequently since my first taste of it through the vine program also goes great with vodka or tequila ,great orange , great taste
its nice to have a treat to give my kids that they feel like they are getting soda they love the taste and i do not feel like i am having to compromise any quality br i do not enjoy soda but i do enjoy this product and occasionally will grab a can great product at a good price ,my kids love it , great taste
this is the only flavor of switch i have tried it tastes just fine and is not overly sweet the carbonation is nice more importantly though this makes a fantastic mixer to use with vodka ,nice alternative , great taste
this stuff is sweet as in really sweet this is really harsh tasting and we were disappointed most soda does not have this much sugar the oz can has grams of sugar yikes for a oz can of soda that would be like having grams of sugar who would drink that br br they need to water this way down we are going to end up giving the rest of this away we cannot drink it ,sweet g of in a oz can soda does not have this much sugar , not as good as it is
i hate orange flavored sodas they all taste like ultra fake chemical laden floor cleaner to me switch is definitely not the case finally an orange soda that tastes like real oranges and tangerines who knew i thoroughly enjoyed this fizzy delight which reminded me of a href http www amazon com gp product b e san pellegrino sparking beverage oz cans a but sweeter this and all switch beverages are highly recommended ,delicious natural tasting , great taste
i really enjoyed this soda i used to be a big fan of orangina a few years ago but switch orange tangerine is way better especially if your looking for a true orangey taste a cold one of these would be very refreshing on a hot summer day tastes sort of like real orange juice mixed with seltzer which begs the question why not just mix it yourself if your at home that is but i would not hesitate buying one of these when out and about very tasty ,actually tastes like real , not as good as it is
i have tried a couple different flavors of this soda and found it to be pretty good its lighter than regular soda ,different than regular soda , great taste
the only way we could make switch orange tangerine drinkable was mixing with club soda it was just way too sweet it then tasted good but orangina and san both have awesome orange flavored sodas out there with no need to mix and surprisingly imported san comes out to be cheaper because the cans are larger oz as opposed to oz ,too sweet too , great taste
all of the switch drink flavors taste good and go down refreshing but this was the one that made me skeptical until i opened the can it does taste like fresh tangerines and the flavor is bright and not weak or watery there is just enough fizz to add some interest but none of the bad stuff people like to avoid in a soda you know artificial flavors and colors preservatives and all that it is just juice with fizz in fact it is good juice with fizz ,a tangerine drink that does not taste watery for switch , not as good as it is
the product description says that it is just juice bubbles and vitamin c really it is just the last two it is not entirely flavorless but i have tasted plenty of beverages that are much better than this one with a lot less carbonation br br and honestly this healthy drink is rather easily replaced by a pill it is not really good for you it is just not directly bad for you sincerely i am fairly sure that sucking on my would you more nutrition than a mountain so it is not like better than soda is really setting the bar high br br rather disappointing particularly compared to the other switch beverages ,really just and vitamin c , not as good as it is
this was pretty tasty but orange has never been my favorite i recommend it if you like flavored drinks i absolutely love the strawberry kiwi these drinks are not too sweet natural and refreshing i will continue to try them my beverage of choice is water and milk and wine but for an treat drinks like these are great br try them ,tasty , the best
one of my favorite drinks is a half and half combination of club soda and fruit juice most fruit juices by themselves are a bit too sweet for me even the ones without added sugar and the addition of carbonation just makes the whole thing more to me this drink does this for me and amazingly they do not add a of sugar too many off the shelf beverages even those claiming to be healthful have way too much sugar or worse the cheap corn syrup sugar substitute these guys give it none of that it is both tasty and refreshing this is a product i would actually buy ,they got it right , great taste
i really liked this drink it is juice with no added sugar so even though the sugar content is a little high it has more nutrients than soda will have any day switch tastes like tangy carbonated orange drink and that is fine with me i did not notice any aftertaste and i could feel safe drinking something fizzy and tasty unlike sparkling water without feeling guilty about it but beware each can is only ounces a little more than a cup you decide if it is worth it ,exactly what is to be , not as good as it is
bit more natural and this one like i said above tastes like carbonated orange juice with tangerine it is nice tasting but too much in the way of calories such for me to drink this very often br br it was certainly good but for the tastebuds of someone who was a soda drinker diet soda for the past years and gave up soda a year ago i very occasionally drink a carbonated beverage now this is not the drink for me i mostly drink water milk iced tea hot tea coffee now and this sweet tasting sugary tasting beverage had way too much carbonation flavoring for me the orange tangerine flavors were nice but still tasted fake which is weird for a drink that things like juice and a label that says natural flavors i would recommend this product only to those who like somewhat sweet carbonated beverages enjoy ,quite tasty enjoyable sweet carbonated beverage , not bad but not bad
first i wish i had gotten two can samples of this product so i could try one with some bourbon i find almost everything mixes with bourbon except tomato juice br br ok what i liked nice fruit flavor strong but not overpowering the carbonation was ok not flat which was nice did not my nose as champagne does br br i did not care for the can taste i felt there was a slight metallic aftertaste really that was the only thing i did not like this product would probably taste better in glass rather than aluminum maybe i am overly picky br br overall not sure i liked it enough to order it again ,it is ok not the best not the worst , not as good as it is
i think i liked a similar drink but this one is just there it is bubbly it is sort of orange flavored it has a but there is nothing about it that me it is a good old fashioned carbonated beverage and if it is inexpensive buy it if it is significantly more expensive than most drinks leave it buy coke instead ,good but nothing special , not as good as it is
this is a beverage that is different from the other beverages out there it starts with a nice citrus zing but then finishes with a little sweet i was hoping for the zing to continue or get more full but it died br br the overall taste is not as sweet as an orange soda and not as citrus as an izze or similar citrus beverage br br overall this is in between and as such is not going to be my pick as i will usually want one or the other br br not bad but not what i want ,not bad but not enough , not as good as it is
it seems that soda was not as good as when i was a kid and people have pointed out that it might be the high fructose corn syrup that is making the taste more dull well this orange soda is made with real sugar as well as a few extra healthy things and the taste is much much better than the regular orange sodas you might find otherwise br br the price is about in line with what you will find in a soda can and the taste is great why would you drink the hfcs mentioned earlier that is just horrible for your body when you have this option i highly recommend it i thought it was quite fabulous ,how i miss the taste of sugar , not as good as it is
i usually drink my soda room temperature but with this one i really needed it to be cold the taste is okay but takes a bit getting used to the tangerine in orange soda there was not as much carbonation which is fantastic as far as i am and it was not sweet i would most certainly consider getting this again as i do not think it is all that bad it is nice to have a bit of change from the usual orange soda flavor ,really not too bad , not as good as it is
switch is not a bad product but it is not great either i like the fact that it is all natural sparkling juice and the can design is pleasant to look at br br the orange tangerine is not bad this flavor is not as syrupy as some of switch others however at calories per can this beverage has more calories per ounce than the average soda too many for me ,it is okay , not as good as it is
corn sweetners so it is more natural than any other orange soda type drink more like a sparkling juice drink i have been a fan of orange juice and soda type drinks when as a kid i would mix oj and orange soda yet the natural taste of this drink is refreshing i tried it both with and without ice and although the iced version is more refreshing if you get a very cold can of this drink it tasted very satisfying and did not leave you with an after taste or with the sugar br br caution it has grams of sugar and although natural you should check with a doc if you have sugar problems grams is equivalent to or more teaspoons of sugar at least if you like sparkling fruit drinks check this one out i will next try it with added sparkling water to it enjoy ,great taste refreshing with or without ice , not bad but not great
it is not bad good ingredients for a change so that is a plus taste is okay but not great i would drink it if offered but doubt i would buy it ,not bad not great , not as good as it is
the switch orange tangerine is a nice beverage that is lightly carbonated and is made with real fruit juice unlike most sodas the switch products are made with real ingredients none of the high fructose corn syrup and it tastes great the cans come in a convenient ounce can and they are great for lunch or an mid afternoon treat if you want a light beverage that is made with the good stuff then you will want to grab a can of the switch do yourself a favor throw out the hfcs sodas and make the switch ,a fine beverage from the switch , great taste
the switch in orange tangerine has perfect serving size to keep the sugar in take at its minimum and naturally the carbonated sensation adding extra to the taste buds br br that was my wife first impression br br i like the fruit soda idea it maybe a better alternative soda if it is indeed made of natural orange but it taste likes other carbonated orange flavored soda on the market the only benefit you are getting and not from the regular soda is it contains daily recommended vitamin c if the price is right does not hurt to try ,great taste but not new taste , not bad
i have now tried several of the switch drinks they are not bad for a carbonated juice drink especially this actually was one of the better flavors i have tried it is got a nice orange juice type flavor that i enjoyed ultimately these drinks remind me of apple beer which is essentially carbonated apple juice i love that drink and think switch could try an apple version of their product i am sure i would love it as well br br that being said give it a try it will quench your thirst and i am sure it will do well in the it fills a void where very few drink manufacturers have entered ,not bad , not as good as it is
i do not know if it has changed since then but when i lived in years ago one thing that stood out to me was how real drinks tasted compared to the artificial flavors typical of america switch brought me back to those days it starts out tangy and the taste turns sweeter in my mouth if they knocked calories off i would definitely purchase this regularly ,delicious , not as good as it is
to have a and are about cents and it would take to do the entire half gallon so all said and done it would cost me about per ounce to make my own carbonated orange tangerine drink so it is about the cost to make it myself no i did not factor in the cost of the itself so that could be considered loading the dice br br so i guess the bottom line here is if you are really big on the whole carbonated orange tangerine thing then you can either buy this product and not be disappointed or you can make a very close of it yourself for about of the cost assuming you have a or you can buy a two liter bottle of house brand orange soda for a buck at your local supermarket and get much the same experience while saving about in the process ,pricey yet surprisingly refreshing , a great product
i always liked orange crush when i was a kid sure it was just sugar water with some flavoring but it was really good flavoring except it had a chemical and an aftertaste that you just had to accept br br well no more switch orange tangerine drink is not sugar water it is juice the good stuff and it is lightly carbonated not like those sugary soft drinks either and no chemical and no aftertaste br br vitamin c and no added sugar i will take that of course there is sugar content but it is just the natural sugar that comes in the juice why did not people think of this stuff when i was a kid ,delicious and no aftertaste , great taste
saw the switch orange tangerine was available i knew i had to try it i liked the kiwi strawberry quite well better than some other reviewers did it seems so i was sure i would enjoy this one just as much br br the initial taste of this orange tangerine carbonated juice is rather tart and the carbonation just seems to make it more tart the aftertaste is rather pleasant so if the aftertaste is what you are looking for in a drink this is the drink for you my wife thought it tasted a bit like champagne if that is any indication of what to expect from this drink br br the flavor is different and not at all what i expected not very refreshing at all i would buy the kiwi berry drink but i think i will take a pass on the orange tangerine in the future ,not bad but not great , it was not bad
switch is a natural carbonated fruit juice beverage i like the way it tastes it is very sweet and a little tangy the ingredients are as follows juice from apple grape tangerine orange and acerola gum acacia natural flavors and colors ascorbic acid vitamin c soy br br an oz can has calories grams of carbs daily requirement of vitamin c and not much else ,a tasty beverage , not bad
the mixture of juices they use to sweeten this give it a little bit of an odd taste and makes it too sweet it is not a straight orange citrus flavor not being an apple juice fan i was not fond of it br br i gave it four stars b c it is what it advertises it is juice with sparkling water unlike some other healthy sparkling beverages that are basically soda br br for sparkling juice i prefer izze it is a little less sweet ,decent but tastes a little odd , not as good as it is
this is a nice refreshing carbonated drink it has no added sugar as advertised but its name is a bit misleading the orange tangerine also has some apple and grape juice added the grape is not a great addition to the blend so i was not thrilled with the flavor ,refreshing and not too sweet , great taste
this was the most potent orange drink i have ever had it might be juice but this drink has some kick br br there are no artificial sweeteners in this drink but it is so highly concentrated that it was sweet and even the tang of the carbonation could not cute into the sugary flavor br br it was way too strong for me and i thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange tangerine this is the drink for you ,now that is orange , not as good as it is
energy drinks are very popular these days most if not all are loaded with sugar various of vitamins and varying energy blends a few energy drinks have tried adding pure juice but have only come up with at most br br if your not a young un and cannot handle that blast of sugar and crash that follows then switch is a better alternative switch is juice zero sugar and lots of vitamin c br br switch is carbonated so with the orange tangerine flavor picture your morning juice with a little soda the taste is sweet but not sugary although the size of the can probably to the recommended serving most people probably do not have this little juice in one sitting br br soda meets juice benefits it is a no brainer how about some more flavors ,sweet and carbonated like energy but without the sugar , not as good as it is
the switch tries to the line between soda and juice and i would say that the experiment is successful it is sweet and rich like soda but it is as the label says juice and therefore of more nutritional value i guess it all comes down to taste and it is more similar to soda than juice here maybe like a more down sunkist soda as i said i liked it and i would probably pick it up again though it has not squirt as my favorite ,pretty good , great taste
i have tasted several of the other flavors of this drink switch but i have to say that this one tops them all perhaps it is because i like orange soda and this drink seems to have all the elements of what i like in the soda without all the harmful ones there is no sugar added no preservatives no artificial colors and it is gluten free this is especially great for someone with allergies or those who are on restricted diets add to that that it is juice and tastes great and you have a winner i liked this product and plan to seek it out at my local store ,very good , not as good as it is
i was looking forward to this tea but unfortunately the mint overpowers the hibiscus and essentially makes this just another kind of mint tea i prefer the hibiscus tart be the star of the show in a hibiscus based tea aka herbal infusion and in my opinion mint and tropical do not mix and now know going forward to pay more attention to the ingredients still worth stars because it can be a refreshing tea on a hot day but just not a great tropical hibiscus tea ,too much mint , great tea
hands down my all time favorite iced tea i typically prefer loose tea but the taste of this tea is wonderful the pouches are so easy to use and make clean up a breeze ,my favorite , great tea
this tea is to die for it hits the spot easy to make ice tea all of my friends love it as well i am delighted to serve it i look forward to drinking it it is my new favorite drink ,i love this tea and so do all my , great tea
we go through a lot of dressing and my husband has to have this brand only so i saw this and said great ,great and easy way to buy , great product
i like the taste of this dressing but realized that it contains the additive mono sodium this chemical gives me which is very difficult to tolerate i am sorry to say that i will no longer purchase this dressing unless they remove this flavor enhancer ,contains msg , good
the cups to make my own coffee k cups work fine if there had been free shipping it would have been better but i will order again and look for a way to not pay the price of the product just for shipping ,cups work great , great coffee
much better than having to fight removing coffee grinds from a metal basket i love being able to just toss grinds into the trash ,great , great coffee
i am very pleased with the disposakups they were part of a christmas gift for my husband and he is filling the disposakups with his favorite starbucks coffee needless to say these will part of the keurig experience for him and we plan to purchase more once he is used the two boxes i ordered i was especially pleased that the order arrived in time for christmas since i was late in finding them we will definitely use this company again ,disposakups , great product
these wonderful cups filters lids saved me from returning my new single cup coffee maker tried many k cup brands and blends and did not care for any of them nor did i like my own coffee option that came with the coffee maker the disposa kups are just what i needed to get a good cup of my own coffee from my new coffee maker would recommend and will order again received in days during christmas rush ,product , great coffee
these little cups are a perfect compliment to our k cup varieties we use them for our coffees and loose teas i was not disappointed and they are much easier to use than the cups sold by keurig ,great substitute , great coffee
work well and made for whatever reason the keurig takes longer to complete the brewing cycle when using these cups and the liquid through the filter on the outside of the cup making a small mess they do the job as intended but could use a different type of filter to make the experience less messy ,disposakups , great product
i am giving this as a gift to go along with a single coffee brewer though ratings say there are problems saving money on easy to purchase coffee is better we live in the sticks in ,save money , great coffee
this was a great buy for the money and a hard product to find i was pleased when i received it doing it this way i cut my coffee costs down by rd even after you consider the price of the product i am very happy ,good buy , great product
the cup filter lid combination that allows for use of ones own coffee in the kuerig brewer is a great idea the quality of the product is good and the use is simple now if they could just get the price down unfortunately we use and love o clock bean coffee which is among the cheapest because we buy it in bulk and grind our own beans if we could save costs by buying disposakups in quantities of or so that would be great ,disposakups , great coffee
was not the lid on tight enough so i made up some more disposakups and made sure the lids were on really tight no they still leaked about or drops from each disposakup which then outside the k kup holder and outside the catch area i needed to clean up around the coffee maker after use br br i give this item stars because they do work and are a great idea but the design of the filter from around the cap causes the leaking if you do not mind a bit of cleanup after each use you ll appreciate these br br i ll use the rest of the box and continue cleaning up after each use but i will not buy more br br the seller offered a refund but it would cost me almost as much to send them back as i would receive as a refund ,good idea but they , not bad but not as good as it is
these were on for a long time but well worth the wait i can finally use the coffee beans i have had for awhile and have a great cup of coffee with no grounds i totally love the product and will definately order more in the future would like to see them in count ,worth the , great coffee
these coffee holders are much easier to use than the others i have used and make life a little easier ,easy to use coffee , great coffee
nice product good company only complaint is that it took over a month for them to ship it after i ordered and they never let me know what was going on ,k cups , great
i just received my order and happy with the ability of using some coffees i never used before as i like my one cup at a time only problem i have found is that the caps are sometimes difficult to get set properly i made up several cups with different coffees and store them with the rest of my supply i will be back for more and will tell my keurig friends ,money saver , good coffee
it was sealed all the way around placed it in my kuerig and hit the brew button at first it seemed to be working then coffee began pouring out of places it is not supposed to by the time it was over i had quite a mess to clean up upon opening the kuerig i found the disposakup completely in tact and the lid still properly however the bit of filter was soaked dripping and hot i had discovered the source of the leak i have tried again several times with the same problem i guess i should have bought the cup after all br br if you like the appearance of convenience and the reality of spending more time cleaning up a mess this is the product for you br br i went ahead and gave it two stars because i like the idea of the product so much ,great but a product , a great product
i have been using the disposakups for about weeks they are easy to put together and fill caps fit i sometimes get but my cuisinart does that with regular k cups i put regular coffee in it maxwell house community coffee sometimes i grind my own coffee always taste just like in drip coffee maker great replacement for k cups cause they have literally doubled in price in just months ,awesome , not good
these worked great for us we are able to reuse the plastic parts a couple of times before them we love being able to use our favorite coffee ,great alternative to the single cups , great product
the disposakups are so easy and convenient to use they are a great substitute when i run out of k cups and do not want to run to the store to buy a replacement supply and pay higher in store prices ,convenient easy , great product
shipped in great shape i gave these to my son he is the one who uses coffee and he really likes these disposable k cups i guess i will still have to send him coffee beans every mo ,good stuff , great coffee
i love coffee that i buy locally and this product allows me to use it in my keurig brewer getting the lid on is a little challenging but the end result is worth it this is the find of mine this year ,cool product , great coffee
cost savings the cups appear to be relatively inexpensive but add in the cost of shipping and handling which is some on top of the featured price about more and the per cup price increases try purchasing multiple packages to reduce shipping cost no go the company just the cost of shipping one package if you were to say order cups you would pay more than dollars and a third would be shipping and handling in addition to the other problems with the design it more or less defeats the purpose large packages of the pre made pods can be purchased for nearly the same per pod cost would not recommend these until the company shipping costs improves design or both you are better off just using the mesh filter pod that comes with your brewer and simply rinsing it out same time involved less cost and lower environmental impact ,good but , not as good as i be
i purchased the cups lids and filters they work exactly how i expected them to work perfectly the lids and cups can be used more than once the filters unfortunately cannot i am going to be looking in the future for cups that have the filters attached like in the regular prefilled k kups very good product though ,cups and lids and filters oh my , good for you
i was very pleased with these disposable k cups i read other peoples comments that the lids are hard to get on i found that true at first until i just used one finger and pressed them on in the center i heard a click and they were ready to go i will order a larger amount next time to save on shipping the hot chocolate k cups prefilled are terrible but these filled with your own chocolate mix are very good ,great product , great product
great product brought it for a gift and will be buying some more for me user friendly product easy to use and works with any kcup machine ,disposable k cups for keurig brewers , great product
these fill your own k cups are great to have and use with a custom coffee that does not come in the k cup variety they are disposable and you can fill several and have them ready i also drink a herbal tea that i buy in bulk and now i can make it with my kuerig would definitely buy again to have on hand ,great to have on , great product
i recently went to hawaii and bought tons of coffee it was such a pain to use the my k cup on the keurig machine because i would have to dump it out and wash it after every use disposakups are a great alternative and work wonderfully with my machine it is now super easy for me to use my own coffee the only drawbacks i have found is that you really have to fill the filter all the way up to get good flavor it leaks a little bit so the outside of the cup is a bit wet after using lastly water moves through it a bit slower than normal k cups so brewing a cup takes a bit longer than normal i would still highly recommend this to anyone who wants to use their own coffee with their keurig machine ,great for using your own coffee , great for
i love the cups i have reviewed this before and said the same thing saving a lot of money using these kups ,for keurig coffee , great taste
this product is exactly as described i use my keurig brewer daily and now i am able to use my choice of coffee they are simple to use and work great the delivery from llc on amazon was prompt and packaged perfectly ,disposakups for keurig , great product
the first shipment i received of this item was great lids fit easily this last shipment either the lids are slightly larger or the cups are smaller the lids are extremely hard to get on if i press too hard the cup starts to i have actually started to use a pair of to get the lids on ,lids too , not as good as
this is the second time i have ordered this product and i plan to order these often they work perfectly and i am able to use my favorite coffees especially when i run out of the prefilled k cups sold at retail stores ,convenient , great product
this product worked exactly as advertised i filled several cups in advance with my own coffee and was able to use them in my machine just like a k cup prior to purchasing i read a review stating that the lid came off when the user was attempting to remove it from the machine this was not the case for me the lid was secure and it just like the more expensive prefilled k cup i will order these disposakups regularly ,perfect works as expected , great product
these cups are so easy to use and saves so much money compared to the store bought kups you can use whatever coffee you want and have as many flavors as you want we are on our th box of these and will continue to use them br br the seller is great in to contact and shipping the last shipment arrived just a couple of days after we bought them long before the due date listed when the order was placed ,big money saver , great product

i have the regular my k cup that comes with the keurig but you have to insert the special holder and fill the filter each time then wash them both out i like these because they are disposable and i can fill several at one time and have them ready in the refrigerator when i want them very convenient ,these work , good for you
these cups work great we have had a keurig for about a year and use a refillable filter cup its so to refill every time you want a cup of coffee especially at am before work these cups are so easy to use and perfect for mornings when you just want a quick cup of coffee the lids are a little tough to get on sometimes and they get stuck in the top of the machines occasionally but still much less work than the filter cup we were using before we get a ready at the beginning of the week and they are ready to go each morning it is great so much more affordable than the name brand cups great product great value ,great product great value , great coffee
the coffee was not strong enough or the cup leaked they simply do not know what they are doing first of all use the right kind of coffee the first time i used it i put in a medium roast that was not ground very fine and yes the coffee was weak so i switched to a very finely ground dark roast and it was perfect and yes they will leak and leave grounds in your keurig if you do not let some of the filter hang over the edge and seal it correctly i had no problem with sealing the cup so far so good makes as good a cup of coffee as the more expensive ready made k cups and have yet to find any grounds in my coffee or in the keurig really a good deal plus i had them three days after ordering very quick shipping ,these work great , great for a
what a pleasure it is to be able to use my own coffee even make cups up to take to work with me these are easy mess free alternatives to the i bought to use with my machine there are no coffee grounds in my sink now ,disposable k cups , great coffee
i received and have been using my disposakups for several days i highly recomend this product i fill up a dozen or so at a time and just pop them into the coffee maker when i want a fresh cup of coffee the coffee comes out fresh and with no coffee grounds in the cup who could ask for more ,disposakups , great coffee
they are just the right size the filter works fine and so does the lid br they re easy to fill and store for future use br since its all in one and disposable like the pre filled keurig cups its a good way to enjoy my favorite brand of coffee ,just right , great product

the seller was prompt to ship i receive the disposable k cup in two days when i receive them i try one of the disposable k cup on the ease of use and the quality of the cup it made and the saving from pre fill k cup coffee brands is worth the price ,awsome product for k cup lover , great coffee
i love these disposable k cups as i prefer to use my own brand s these accomplish the job perfectly and so easy to use for this product seller was prompt in shipping good packaging i will purchase again a ,i love these , great taste
i decided to give these a try the lids are very difficult to put on and i often ended up the cup while trying to the lid they do not seal perfectly and i often found unexpected but they do the job since i have a keurig filter i thought of just buying the paper filters to save on cleanup for almost from this vendor you can get fifty paper filters i would just assume use paper towels that works out to be just under cents for a small piece of paper disposakups please re your pricing ,over priced product so so , great product
i am a of habit and when i purchased my keurig i tasted alot of the coffee brands and flavors made for my however i never found one that i said this could replace the coffee i am currently using so when i discovered the disposable k cups i was delighted the problem now was i did not purchase enough so now i am waiting on my second delivery great service ,awesome idea , great coffee
over a year ago i purchased a breville k cups brewer and immediately found the the available selection and choices to exceed what i had expected i loved using it and brewing what i wanted cup at a time i found that i was paying about cents cup and that was also great br now the prices have to nearly or over cup and that has made me slow down my purchase rate and my enjoyment of my single cup brewer br br enter the disposakups and suddenly the price is reasonable again and i can grind my own or purchase and use their coffees these are so simple convenient and easy that i really enjoy that my world of coffee is wide open again br br thanks for such a great product br br ,disposakups great product open , great coffee
i ordered the disposakups because i have several coffees in bags that i had left over and wanted to use the cups work great i quickly figured out that the filter must be pushed down in order for the lid to fit easy to load and easy to dispose ,disposakups work great , great coffee
these cups work for the most part except for the fact that all most all of them leak out the top of the cap all seem to some leakage through the paper filter at the cap and cup and approximately overflow and leak around the cup and down the sides providing some grounds with the coffee ,good start but could be better , great product
caused my cuisinart k cup brewer to leak every time i used it great idea just needs some adjustments so that the coffee maker works properly with it ,too for , great product
these work just fine after ground coffee into a series of these cups do it over a plate with ground coffee in a small bowl doing so you get just the fine coffee you want and are not by the standard selections but there is no saving money lb coffee works out to cents per cup plus the cents per disposakup gives cents per cup about the price of regular k cups darn hoped i would save money but i do get my choice ,work fine make great coffee but w o true , great coffee
i have tried another brand of one cup coffee making these made the job easy and no mess the other method had a plastic holder and lid and a paper basket you of the paper basket only the plastic would be very warm to the touch at the very least then you had to rinse the plastic holder and top for any grinds that might have ,excellent product , great coffee
this product saves me money since i can use a regular brand that i like in these kcups and i can still have the kcup convenience of making one drink at a time without using nasty instant coffee great product ,kcup but less , great for
a href http www amazon com gp product b k disposakups disposable k cups for keurig brewers cups lids filters disposable a br br i bought these because i occasionally run out of my favorite blend and like the of these over the type filters i also prefer decaf black unsweetened tea for iced tea that is unavailable in k cups these are great for both and i am reordering to keep could not be happier ,outstanding product , great product
fast service and shipping these little k cups are great as you can use any kind of coffee or tea that you like at a much reduced price over regular k cups easy to use no mess what is not to like if you have coffee maker that uses k cups you have to try these it puts you back in control of drinking the kind of coffee you like ,disposakups are great , great taste
i really enjoy this disposable the only thing that would make it better would be for the cups and lids to be made out of a more eco friendly material coffee tastes great ,good alternative , great coffee
when i used the k cup filter that came w keurig i did not like the taste of any coffee i used so i stopped using it altogether however when i saw disposakups on amazon i had my doubts but took a chance they worked great plan to keep them in stock ,disposakups , good coffee
br no other type of device for brewing bagged coffee in my keurig k cup or any other way to recycle k cups has worked well for me the standard device made by keurig is so difficult to clean each time that i just choose to never use it br br disposakups are the perfect item for brewing my favorite coffees that are not available in k cup form the pieces fit together perfectly and with a snap i am able to brew a cup of coffee and still have the disposable feature of regular k cups and no clean up plus you can assemble however many custom k cups ahead of time with disposakups so they are very helpful to have for holiday gatherings and parties br br thank you thank you i will be purchasing a big supply soon so i will be well stocked for the holidays ,exactly what i have been looking for to brew coffee , great coffee
i love these disposakups they allow me to use some of my favorite canned or fresh bean coffee in my keurig coffee maker there is no mess easy as using the regular k kups just throw away when you are done making your coffee love the convenience i have just place a nd order ,excellent product , great coffee
the disposakups work as advertised they are easy to use just put your favorite coffee in the cup pop the cap on and brew this allows me to save quite a bit of money while using my favorite coffee i filled about of them at one time so there is always one standing by when i am desperate for a cup there is no need to wash out a filter just toss it in the trash like the store bought k cups they also make a good system if you run out of the store bought k kups br i would be interested to know if the company uses or plans to use recycled plastic or plastic alternatives in the manufacturing of these ,quick easy and cheap k cups , great coffee
great product to tide me over with my supply of starbucks til they start making k cups easy to and use with my own ground coffee ,for k cups , great product
great product you to use your own coffee in your single brew maker and i can make up several at a time ,great product , great coffee
i like the disposakups if i am more than one cup it is quicker to use the disposakups than it is to clean out the refillable holder which came with my machine ,i like the disposakups , great product
then proceeded to place the filter into the disposable k cup add my freshly ground beans and placed the cap on tightly great ready to brew my first cup of my favorite coffee the whole procedure worked well until the cycle was almost finished and then it happened hot water started out of my keurig machine from all sides i was trying to move my cup to catch the water but it was coming out too fast and very hot i was disappointed with the performance of this product the coffee was good although not a full cup and i had a mess to clean i have tried grinding the beans finer and also tried to fill the cups at different levels but the results are still the same i will continue experimenting with the disposable k cups and if i find the right combination i will let you know ,disposable k cups for keurig brewers , i love it
this product works just as described you simply place a filter in the disposable cup add your own coffee snap on the lid and make the cup of coffee as you would with a regular k cup the coffee is just as good as any prepackaged k cups and you can use the brand of your choice at a fraction of the cost and no washing out those mesh reusable filters as some other reviewers have noted sometimes the cup gets stuck on the handle that as you are trying to remove the used cup but you simply pull it out and i have never had a lid fall of so there is still no mess i will definitely continue to use this product ,i love disposakups , great coffee
i was getting tired from washing out the little refillable baskets to make a second cup the are to get multiple baskets or the disposable type the is a little better and the coffee has fewer solids it is easy to use and does what it says ,makes keurig more convenient , great product
tried the disposable k cups and they work great just as good as keurig k cups put my own mid grind coffee in cups and they worked without problems they could not be any easier to use will continue to use them ,great disposable k cups , great coffee
product is as advertised a good way to your own coffee blends it is easy to fill and prepare for use however it sometime leaks at the end of the brewing process ,almost perfect , great coffee
like the disposakup lids the disposakup set is just as good if not better if you tossed your previous keurig kcups this set will take care of you i will definitely be purchasing them again ,buy these , not as good as it
i love disposakups and i am so glad that provides them to consumers br disposakups are fantastic and the vendor does a very good job with its customers ,excellent service , great product
i have lots of ground coffee and since having my keurig have not been able to use it but with the disposable cups i can use up all my ground coffee and get the tastes i want i would buy again convenient be sure you snap the lid on securely because it is a tight fit ,disposable k cup filters , great coffee
my wife just loves these cups first off i have to say they arrived a month earlier than stated excellent the convenience of being able to use your own coffee and throw away the little cups afterwards is fantastic no clean up excellent ,nothing away , great coffee
i have ordered three boxes of these so far they work very well shipping was fast their claim to is the ability to pre fill these little cups and store them for later i just store them in the freezer the problem with most refillable disposable filter k cups is that they are prepared on a per cup basis to me this defeats the whole usefulness of the k cup system instead with these i can sit at the table and quickly throw together all and store them is maintained and the cost effectiveness goes up as these are so much cheaper than buying the prepared ones ,very good alternative to , great product
it is difficult to judge the amount and grind of coffee to put in the k cups if it is too fine a grind or is too packed full it only give you a half of a cup ,not bad but pricey , not as good as it is
i recently purchased disposakups from this seller not only did i receive great customer service and fast shipping but my product came packaged perfectly i absolutely love the idea of the disposakups however after using a few they just do not live up to my expectations the lid often gets stuck in the keurig when its done brewing sometimes the holes do not properly and every time i am left with water out in all directions while it brews definitely not a replacement for or ,great , great product
coffee however they still leaked there were still grounds in my coffee and it make my keurig run much slower not to mention the cleanup br br my business uses a keurig so that all of us can brew the coffee of our choice and we also have a couple of tea and hot chocolate drinkers everytime i use the disposable cups i have to wipe down the machine drip tray my cup i also have to clean out the interior of the cup so that the next person does not have to put up with my leftovers all in all these were a nice idea but the amount of work they require makes paying a little for the convenience of regular k cups more attractive i will probably use up what i have and then go back to the regular k cups or find a more landfill friendly solution ,not what i for , not as good as i have
i found these cups to be easy to use and a lovely way to make pods of your own favorite coffee ,easy to use , great product
thank god they made them i cannot always afford the buy the regular k cups the only change i would make is to have peel and stick top for them the peel and sticks could have your own name on them so you could share them with your friends ,great way to make your own , great product
we have the k cup however these disposable k cups are the best ever i am always rushed in the morning and cleaning out the old k cup to make another cup of coffee to put in the cup is not what i want to do br br i m so grateful to have found this product ,great easy product , great coffee
this is a great product and would highly recommend to all keurig fans you can make your own k cups at a fraction of the cost ,great product quick delivery , great product
this filters are perfect to use with the extra ground coffee i have they are as good or better than the k cups ,coffee filters , great coffee
i really liked the of the product so i ordered they are not easy to store and therefore assemble for use but this the usefulness of the product ,disposakups , great product
product arrived earlier than expected and was just what i expected an easy and cheap way to make my own keurig k cups great for company everyone gets what they want without having to buy a whole box of k cups i just buy a few of the little one pot coffee packages and can make whatever someone wants awesome ,nice , good coffee
i love this product ive tried several different options this one is the best unlike most people k cups are too strong for me with this i can make it however i want and my husband can use the k cups most products ive tried just dont filter good enough but this one does i like being able to just throw it away when im done its a little pricey mostly shipping costs but all in all worth it ,love this product , great product
not at all happy with the instant coffee taste of my cute little brewer i began hunting for a solution the disposakups were it my own fresh ground coffee packed in tight in the disposakup makes a good cuppa joe easy to use and no mess love them shipping was fast and they are a good value in my opinion thanks ,made my worth the , great coffee
disposakups disposable k cups for keurig brewers cups lids filters disposable are handy because you buy your own coffee that you like and just fill k cups and then throw them out i pre fill them so all i have to do is put them in the machine ,disposakups disposable k cups for keurig brewers cups lids filters disposable , great coffee
these things work very well the only trouble i have had with them is if you leave one in the machine overnight it sticks and is hard to get out otherwise a great product ,pretty cool , great product
the lids do not fit coffee runs out of the pod a total waste of money there are other filters on the market that are much better ,save your money , not as good as it is
disposakups over a month after ordering them and put them to use i was immediately disappointed filters did not hold very much coffee it was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup the coffee was very weak br br this product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made k cups the body and lids are plastic normal k cups do not have a plastic lid notice they say disposable so put them in the trash they are not recyclable landfill br br they are not convenient they are a bit messy a pain to put together and still expensive not worth it there are better alternatives out there that will save you money make better coffee and not go into a landfill br br sorry i wish i had better news i think i will return these ,things that make and work , good for me
the product stinks and that is mildly stated the caps do not snap on easily and if you apply too much pressure the cup part in and you end up with ground coffee everywhere i threw the whole order into the trash and called it a day i will be using produced k cups i e dunkin donuts starbucks even folgers from this point on ,do not waste your money , not as good as i have
i was so excited to get these k cups and immediately filled for future brewing with my favorite coffee i tried one right away the coffee started running down the front of my i thought i had filled the cup wrong and maybe not had the lid sealed well enough but when the coffee was done i opened the k cup and found a melted wrinkled container i have subsequently tried more of the that i filled after carefully checking that they were properly put together and all melted in the same way i have since thrown the rest away because i was tired of the mess they created do not buy these they do not stand up to hot water ,these cups the coffee , great coffee
for product to work properly imho you need coffee ground as fine as possible once filter has been carefully measure of coffee in it lid into place then press down on center w thumb br br plan to use no more than oz of water for your cup br br of used cup from machine is occasional problem it and it will generally up ,k cups are , great coffee
the solo k cup works perfectly instead of these i totally agree with the poor performance review i also got coffee grounds in my cup everytime i used these yes even with the filter the cup is poorly designed it clogged the system causing the water to back up producing a half cup of coffee or water spilling outside the top of the unit ,do not buy , great coffee
finally a cheaper alternative to buying k cups i can use all of the half full bags of coffee in my cupboard from my pre keurig days works perfectly for both of my keurig machines ,disposakups , great coffee
the products lid stays attached to the needle on the keurig allowing coffee grounds to fall everywhere very messy if this did not happen it would work well ,disposable , great coffee
these cups were difficult to cap putting the lids on securely was a show and they created a mess when used in the keurig the water went everywhere add together and mess with an end outcome of weak cup o joe i am not a very happy buyer ,terrible , great product
the lids are impossible to secure this purchase was a complete waste of money product cannot be used as lids are unable to be ,big disappointment , good but not great
they look like a good idea my wife and i thought we would give them a try they are pretty easy to use the thing we do not like is the mess they make in the machine even when to top is secure they leak into the machine you have to keep cleaning the filter basket or it gets sticky i would advise you to use something better like the e z cup ,could be better , good for you
looking at all the disposable reusable k cup i think i will purchasing any at this time and continue to use my tried and true free method br free after the cost of an original k cup br br after using your k cup filled with coffee that you have purchased br br take off the aluminum lid that seals the top br empty grounds into the trash or br rinse out the inside you will see there is already a filter inside br fill with your own coffee br place a small square of aluminum foil on top and be sure to make it tight and sealed around the top edges of the cup br br now reuse your cup a few times or many it is up to you as long as the filter holds up just re do all the for each cup you make ,there is a much cheaper way to use your k cups , great product
is what these machines are designed to do br br no matter what method i use i have learned to carefully reach in and pull the little gasket down as far as i can on the upper needle this will ensure a better seal and avoid overflow br br just as importantly when i put the disposakup in i press it down to make sure the lower needle has the cup completely this will make sure you have a flow of water that through the cup br br fill it up and then tap the cup on the counter to settle the coffee grinds into the cup do not press the coffee down or pack it in br br the key is take a couple extra seconds and these will work perfectly and you will save money i love mine and will be ordering more once they are available again ,save money but use with care , not as good as you are
after a lot of trial and error with just water i figured out how to make these handy self fill coffee pods not leak all over the place the secret is to the filter all the way into the pod and not snap the lid over the edge of the filter make sure the filter is all inside it is enough and stays and fine when you brew you really need to create a seal with the lid leaving the filter hanging out breaks the seal and allows liquid to out ,how to the , great product
my daughter lives in hawaii and sent me some great coffee from there i have a keurig and was not sure how to use the new coffee i got these fast fast and now am using my hawaiian coffee great product ,good option , great coffee
i ordered the disposa kups with the thought of making my own kups they do not fit together without a big production the lids will not fit and water comes out the top of the brewer lid as well as the kcup just a big mess not what i wanted at all want to return them and get a refund ,ordered from amazon , not as good as it is
we use the k caps so that we can re use our k cups by them with the coffee we like we have lost or given away several of the caps over the years that we have been using them so i thought i would buy some more k caps it turns out the prices for them have increased substantially so i went in search of another alternative that would be less expensive i found these and thought i had found the answer but they do not quite work as well as the original k cups they actually caused the keurig to water in directions other than the intended and then allowed enough coffee grounds to escape that the holder for the cups became clogged and had to be disassembled and thoroughly cleaned before it could be used again good idea but not quite right ,almost but not quite , great coffee
these will leak the my k cup was the best of the lot for not leaking br but like i said above if the get the grind more toward the coarse side they all will work br br bottom line br this product is great for storing pre measured amounts that you have ground earlier in weekly batches br make your measuring and grinding mess once and then fill up or so of these cups with your own recipe br br if you want to get more accurate instead of using tablespoons get a good scale for br br note that if you are in a hurry then go ahead and do use this product as advertised here br i just thought that these were too expensive also and that you had to keep reordering them br but yes go ahead and use them if you want to do that ,i use these for after i have out the and amount , good but not great
these do work nicely but some of them for some reason seem to stick on the upper needle i have yet to figure out why they stick on that needle but when they do it is a real pain to remove it this is a minor and only a sometimes so that is why stars in of br my machine in a brand new one so the needle being dirty is not the problem when these do not stick they work very nicely and as stated br i wish the little cups that hold the filters were biodegradable as that would be a real plus but these do save money since the k cups are so expensive i will continue to use these and spend the savings on really great coffee lol ,disposakups , great product
i have never enjoyed my more they could not be easier to use and i am so happy to be using my favorite coffee and making it to my own love these things br br additional comment in reading the reviews i see some complaints about leakage etc one trick i have come to rely on is not to fill the kup all the way to the top with the coffee you need to leave some room at t the top so that the lid is not the coffee inside maybe a little less than cm from the top when i follow this i get a perfect cup every time when i fill it too high i end up with leakage the only problem is that i usually need a cup of coffee he morning before i can follow my own instructions ,i love these things , good coffee but not the best
i am sorry to say i had trouble with the cups themselves each time i used them my machine would say which i did the first time when i used them the nd and rd times the problem occurred again i was able to clear the hot water with a toothpick which the problem i will not use them again though because i do not want to have to do that after every use ,disposable and filters , not as good as it is
this is what is needed to use with finely ground coffees it works well with none fine ground coffee i prefer using my solo fill cups they are easier to use i have had six for some time and have had no problem except when using fine ground coffee ,fine ground , good stuff
the units go together easily but no matter how much or little coffee i put in the filter it caused overflow it is as if the filters are too thick i also had a few cups that did not pierce correctly definitely not worth the money for these ,never again , not as good as it is
these little cups are a waste of money the machine had a difficult time processing the coffee through the cup and as a result i ended up with several half cups of coffee br br i tried it about times and then gave up ,they do not work , good coffee
i got coffee grounds in my cup out of the times i used these very disappointed because i would like to use my coffee the hole punctured in the bottom is larger than the one out with the regular k cups probably due to the design on the bottom of the cup i have to flush the system each time i have used this product wasting time and water ,poor , not as good as i have
i tried these disposakups several times and each time the filter came loose at the top resulting in coffee and grounds everywhere the kup and lid are both made from flimsy plastic that at the brewing temperature the result is a loose fit at the top during brewing of kup at the bottom because filter is forced down and coffee and grounds everywhere the lids work one time with keurig kups cleaned and but the second time they are loose and result in overflow an email to the company for a refund was not answered do not buy these ,waste of money , not as good as i have
i ordered disposakups they came fast and were just what was advertised i will definitely be re ordering thanks alot ,star rating for , great taste
coffee the night before but now i just make up the disposable k cups a dozen at a time and we fresh brew by the cup in the morning for several days running we actually use less coffee after and who does not want the last cup i think the savings on coffee and mr coffee filters is probably break even with the cost of the disposable k cups so net net they seem free br br only one con from me it is hard for these old hands to fit the lid on due to the filter the top of the k cup or cutting away the causes grinds in the brew and a clogged lower needle i do not think there is a cure without the downside being greater than the problem i have found patience and not over loading the k cup to be the best solution ,why did not think of this , not my favorite
skeptical at first but thought for the price i would give it a try and the product works great i fill up the cups with the filter lid and store it in an old k cup box the lids fit tight and it works just like the more expensive k cups the only issue is that on my cup setting there is a little spill over but there are no problems with the cup setting once in a while when you open the top to put in another cup it will stick to the top of the machine where the hole the cup but that is in once in a while in fact i am about to purchase again i only wish the shipping was not as much as the product it arrived earlier than scheduled i believe all in all i will be using these on a regular basis ,time using disposakups , good but not great
when i bought my keurig brewer i was so impressed at how it worked the different types of coffee and how it brewed br however i did not realize how expensive the coffee k cups would be i could not spend dollars a month on coffee br br then i found disposakups what a great idea and they are so easy to use the very best part about them is that fact that they can be thrown away no having to wash the insert that keurig provides br br these cups do not leak they work perfectly i will be ordering more ,disposakups are fantastic , great coffee
bought a pack of a of these and each cup it takes so long to process the coffee each cup i get coffee grounds in and not a whole cup of coffee great concept i believe the paper filter is to fine which holds back the coffee and pressure which results in of coffee grounds out of the other holes regular k cups work work much better again great idea just not so great of a product ,not the same , not good
it worked just as it claimed i had no leaking at all and it brewed a really great tasting cup of coffee really happy that i have found these ,works great , good coffee
these cups and filters work excellent a cheaper alternative to use your own coffee br will definitely purchase more ,keurig cups lids filters , great product
first of all i thought i could save money filling my own keurig k cups by the time i bought the cups paid shipping and bought coffee to put in them i was already in the hole br if all you have to do is fill these little cups all day i guess it will work for you because you can have the coffee of your choice the other problem was is they get stuck in the brewer when you try to take them out br i still have about thirty left and when they are gone i will not replace them ,not worth the , great taste
i looked i bought i tried several different types of brewing cups for the cost and quality these are the best i can make a few ahead of time using my preferred brand of coffee i ll definitely keep these in stock at my house ,exactly what i needed , great taste
i thought these would be the perfect answer sadly i guess the pressure with which my keurig machine shoots the water through the k cup is too much for the disposa cup because every single time i tried it coffee grounds were up through the tiny hole in the lid of the disposa cup all over the inside of where the k cup sits in my keurig and yes i used them properly br br so the issue at least in my keurig machine seems to be with the lids some have suggested its a design flaw with the keurig machine in either case these disposa cups were not the answer for me br br biggest waste of money ever i cannot recommend ,coffee keurig machine k cup and down into my coffee every time , great coffee
i bought this through amazon because most items i have purchased through them have been great this product is the exception they are very difficult to seal or close once filled and they make one huge mess of your machine this product is just not ready for prime time also it is not a cheap product the filters leak out of the sides which i do not understand as it cannot be sealed any better than i have been doing most important and this is important it is made in china so you just cannot be sure that it is free of chemicals that are released during the brewing process other products clearly state that they are chemical free i cannot remember if it or but take that into consideration buy something else please ,do not even it , not as good as i be
the service and delivery from amazon was great however the product itself is not worth buying no matter what i try coffee leaks out around the kcup when brewing it makes a mess wanted the cups to use my favorite coffee tim but guess i will just have to get used to other brands ,not worth buying , great coffee
my sister bought a keurig we all started using it but mom still had her cans of coffee i did not want them to go to waste so i bought this figuring i could make her k cups with her own coffee the cups are flimsy first of all most of them too easily while getting the top on it looks like a good seal and yes i made sure there were no coffee grounds on the edge which i know can screw up the seal but they still leak get one of the reusable cups it will be better for you and your keurig ,can you say , great coffee
the lids keep popping off when the cup fills up with water the only i have not tried is putting holes in bottom of the cup so that the water might flow out faster it is a damn mess getting coffee grounds in your cup i would not buy anymore of them unless i can fix the problem no more k cups for me ,poor , not as good as it is
we put together the cups everything went well with t he coffee into the cups along with a filter br when putting the kcup into the coffee machine it would only drip i checked everything and it was put together correctly i took the made up cups to my son coffee maker keurig brand also it did the same thing it starts out ok only made of coffee br we tried it with two different of keurig and both did not work it did make holes in right places ,disposable k cups , great coffee
seemed to be sealed like the original k cups but was very disappointed in the product though the cups came with no instructions it was apparent that you just put the filter in add coffee then pop the lid on trouble is the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup but when doing that i found it impossible to seal the cups so i had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid after doing that and trying the coffee ran very slow though the k cup and after only about three cups the keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working i cleaned out with vinegar and tried again but same result i ended up throwing these away as it did not seem worth the effort to return them not a good product ,did not work well my machine , not my favorite
the pods worked as described i did not have i found the best way to secure the top is to press the raised area in the center of the top wish they were sold in larger quantities ,great product , great coffee
i was really hoping that your product would solve my with the keurig coffe maker that i received for xmas i am a coffee and chicory drinker so of course i wanted to have the same great coffee thru the keurig machine the mesh filter that i bought first left a residue in the brew so i that the paper filter you created would do the job well it does it is work properly but it is a little large for the keurig device so water and grinds sort of go everywhere i dont think your product isnt good the whole keurig experience is a great disappointment ,good try but , great coffee
i had been looking for something to use with my own coffee i know the keurig has its own my k cup but i was not satisfied with the results there were also suggestions on making personal k cups by saving the used k cups and rinsing them out and them with coffee and then covering them with foil or plastic wrap what a pain that was br br after looking at several different disposable k cups for the keurig i came across this one and felt it did what i wanted much less mess involved and works great ,very i can use my own coffee , great coffee
these disposakups work great i simply fill up a dozen or more with my favorite flavored coffee and i am good to go it is a great alternative to buying the expensive pre filled k cups not only were the pre filled k cups expensive but they do not offer my favorite coffee blends i was using the reusable k cup filters which are quite expensive to purchase so i only had they leaked while brewing were messy to empty and wash to re use the disposakups work much better just as well as the pre filled k cups no leaks no mess and i can re use them again if i want by throwing out the filter rinsing using a fresh filter just have to line up the holes great product i highly recommend it i love my coffee machine again ,disposable is great , great coffee
i recieved my and was a little disappointed first they took quite awhile to arrive in the mail however when i was tracking the product it did say that it would take some time to deliver i have the keurig cuisinart and the cups work ok but they do not allow the machine to finish the brewing process it does not allow the to completely close which will not let the machine complete the brewing i have to take the cup out in order for it to finish however it is very convenient and makes it much more cost effective but i do not know that i would buy them again because i am worried i may ruin my machine ,like but not perfect , not as good as it is
awesome idea i could not find my husband favorite coffee in the k cups so i bought these to make my own works great with loose leaf teas too ,real money saver , great coffee
this product is the way to go for making your own favorite blend of coffee and loose leaf tea i use them for tea and found that i can reuse them for two or three cups ,great product , great product
i purchased this product to be able to use my own coffee and tea in the keurig the product does what it says the only drawback that i can tell exists is the expensive shipping i would also like to have some suggested measurements for coffee and tea to fill the cup perhaps a section on their website where people can just start recording their experiences with different amounts of product just my cents ,good product expensive shipping , great tea
i really like the idea of the k cup coffee maker you make it the strength that you want and no wasting a half a pot of coffee i did not like the horrible price for the pre made k cups this is a great compromise the only thing that could be a bit of a problem for some is that they will leak if you do not puncture them fully this is easily corrected by the open close once and closing a second time now if they would make them out of biodegradable cardboard or something else i could the rest of the planet would love them too ,glad i got boxes , not as good as i be
these work fine all i really wanted to try were the paper filters the plastic is not environmentally friendly i have a reusable keurig filter but it is messy to clean after use the paper filters work great in it i can use my own coffee which is not available through keurig i have asked if the paper filters could be bought separately but never got a response ,cups filters , great for
to say that the product has worked perfectly maybe the issue with some users is that they are not pressing the lid on tight enough or are not allowing the filter to hang over the edge and be sealed in place by the lid there was no leaking at all and i have used cups already i also read that the coffee does not seem to be as strong as regular brew that is true probably due to the type of grind my to the issue is to have a regular coffee cup in place but choose the smallest cup on the keurig which gives you roughly half a cup of coffee lift the handle as though you are going to remove the kcup and just push it back down and brew a second tiny cup into the already brewed cup perfect i definitely recommend and will certainly purchase again ,keurig disposakups , not my favorite
but my five stars come with a warning do not use these little cups without using the little filters especially with teas or tea based coffee substitutes like loose the tea leaves swell to a far greater than water ground coffee beans they also swell much faster which tends to clog the small puncture at the bottom of the little cups so not using the filter is a very very idea if you put less tea in the little cups the tea still clogs the system without the filters br br so be wise and use the cups with the filters br br for what it is worth though the solo my k cup works perfectly with all types of contents with or without the little filters it is ridiculously expensive however happily for me who am not with dough the plastic cups with the little filters are an answer ,but do not use for teas , tea
these cups are simple and easy to use the only drawback is the fact that maybe of the cups get caught in the unit when you open however they are easy to remove once you just close and ,better , great taste
cup no ground left in the bottom of my coffee makes a strong hot cup of joe the cup melts to the shape of your coffee maker it works wonderfully but when i did the math for saving a few bucks the whole reason i went looking for an alternative it is just about the same as buying the prepackaged cups i try to buy the k cups around except you can choose your own coffee and you have to measure it out now i have not used all cups yet so i will see if some of my coffee is left over and then it might be a little cheaper the breakdown dollars for the disposable cups shipping included and for my favorite coffee time to fill the cups environmentally wasteful we need a better solution the reusable filters received mixed reviews but i might give it a shot ,makes a great cup of , not as good as i have
these k cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made k cups i now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the k cup and puncture it again for the water to come through i think the material in the disposable k cup is too heavy and the needle on the bottom ,real bad idea , good but not great
can even say a bag of starbucks breakfast blend ground is around so your at thats only boxes of kcups coffee and you can fill on a single lb bag a lb tub of folgers can fill about of these refills for for the tub so go for it you will not regret it br br one thing i want to point out is the included filters do hang out the edges a bit nothing wrong it just adds to the seal and depending on your brewers strength you can see after brewing a cup but who cares they are disposable if you are a total cheap you can pop the lids off and use the cups again if you do not mind a whole in the bottom from where the brewer pops it but your freshness will not last with a re used cup hope this review helps thanks ,a must for who k cups are too expensive , good but not great
works great so much easier to use than the one you buy for the machine less mess just throw it away ,great , great product
what can i say they just work no muss no fuss fill the cup pop the top on and save money ,just perfect , good
so glad that someone came up with these we had experimented with several ways to make a filter for the fill your own kup that came with the keurig and nothing worked these are great and we like the coffee we use much better than the kups from keurig the only problem with the disposacups is that sometimes the on the paper filters prevent you from the lid to remedy this i spread the out a little more then the lid snaps right on great product saves a ton of money and we reuse the cup and only replace the lid and filter ,finally an to the expensive keurig cups , great product
these cups are usable as stated they are exactly what i was looking for which was a less expensive method to have coffee they do leak slightly but not too bad not sure if it makes the hole a little larger than the prepackaged cups but on the high side i do get the have the coffee that i want the way i want it which is great ,good product , not as good as it is
i fill up a dozen of these with dd dark and take them to work for my afternoon cup i use not at home for my breakfast dose these do the job are very economical and i only have a problem with a bit of grinds run through if the machine is dirty they need to be wiped down every do often and do not let the needles plug up ,great for work coffee , great product
these cups are great i have been the originals and putting aluminum foil for the top these make it much easier and you can reuse them also ,disposable cups a must , great product
this was a return buy i bought to try and loved them this time i ordered they are for your favorite coffee ,excellent , great product
i was looking for a simple and inexpensive way to provide my own supply of home made k cups this product is all that it is described to be fairly easy to use and does not affect the cup of coffee clearly the cups and lids are in fact reusable albeit a little messy br i have used all filters so i am at a point where i need to decide if i want to continue on with this regimen or go to plan b br i am to try one of the reusable style cups that do not require the use of a filter my hope is that it will be a little quicker and less messy to use br however if plan b does not meet my expectations i can always order another supply of filters and continue on with this disposacups system ,is the key , great coffee
great way to use your own coffee rather than buying k cups they are great because you do not have to change out the holding tray and there is no mess u just toss them like you would a k kup no washing out of the filter every time it would be nice if there were not parts to the process filter already in cup i just load up at a time and am set for the week ,great way to use your own coffee , great coffee
the basic problem with this product is that unless you load a very small amount of coffee in the filter the filter clogs this causes the coffee ground and hot water to back up through the hole in the top and cause a mess my son and i spent a few hours experimenting with different ways to prevent this but we have i suspected the filter but i used filters which work perfectly fine in my cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter even worse coffee grounds in my coffee however if you like your coffee very weak this will work well for you i hope they can fix the design issues until then i will stick with my cup ,not very good for me , not as good as i have
it took a couple of tries to figure out how to snap on the cap and a couple of tries to tell how much coffee to put in it for the strength preferred after that it is economical and not much trouble ,and , not as good as it is
this is a great idea but i find that the grounds get into the coffee and the coffee does not come out of the maker as nice as the regular kcups it is messy as it comes out and misses the mug it still is nice but is not quite as good as the ,good idea but needs some work , great taste
i am very happy with the single serve brewers the item arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect packaging now i can brew my favorite brand of coffee anytime i want ,very happy , great coffee
received the order very fast the lids are a little hard to get on but they work fine it is a good way to use your own brand of coffee if you like ,k cup cups , good coffee
the cups are a little tight for my machine you have to press down on the handle really hard also the lids do not fit properly unless the filter is pushed down all the way into the cup ,k cups amazon , good coffee
i picked these up for my wife so she could make coffee out of any brand she likes they work perfectly in her new keurig that i got her for christmas you could not ask for better ,great product , great coffee
easily dispose of these disposable kups after using br br good that you can use your own coffee fresh coffees i personally like coffees from puerto rico and other countries br br the bad sometimes is messy coffee grinds seem to leak creating a slight mess and the need to clean the machine this leak is more in the area of the kups lid and cup and some times these grinds even get in your cup of coffee just read other reviews about this not sure if it could be related to how fine are the grinds of coffee br br on the other hand with disposable kups you do not need to keep cleaning wire filter baskets that is a very plus br br all considered will probably buy again but wish a better lid cup seal that will not leak hope down the road they will offer improved ,good and bad be read reviews , not bad but not bad
even then we like a good cup of morning coffee flavored coffee during the day and decaf at night so the pot is in use constantly and with a variety of goodies br br i was given a gourmet assortment of ground coffee and it has been sitting on the shelf for quite awhile but now thanks to the disposable k cups i am finally able to experiment with some lovely new flavors while the die in the family can stay with their favorite brew as soon as i saw the disposable k cups and filters i knew i had to order this product it is easy to use disposable and it is just as fast to make a cup of delicious coffee in this container as it is to stand over the two drawer rack trying to decide which flavor to choose we are very happy with this product ,very experience , great coffee
these k cups really save money i can have the coffee i like and my husband can have his delivery was quick and product exactly as described will be buying more ,money , great coffee
i really like them but they are sort of hard to put the lid on without the cup wish that was easier ,disposakups , good
i love these little disposakups it seems everywhere i go people have a keurig at work my daughters and my girl friends all have a keurig except my coffee does not come in a k cup so with an espresso grind and these disposakups i can bring my favorite keurig coffee any where i go have disposakups will travel ,disposakups are a nice alternative , great coffee
this is a great product and you provided great customer service thanks so much for the opportunity to purchase this item ,great product great customer service , great product
my husband recently bought me a keurig brewer i was excited for my new toy but my joy quickly turned into dismay when i saw how expensive the little cups cost i love coffee and have always bought beans to grind i was delighted when i found these wonderful little disposable filters to use with my brewer now i have the best of both worlds br i placed my order and to my surprise they showed up days later ,disposable , great coffee
thought this might be a nice alternative to use with my favorite coffee but was sadly disappointed it leaked all over no matter what we tried and the coffee was weak machine clogged with most attempts and water would not brew thru at times the cup even melted a little leaving a nasty taste in the coffee br br go with the alternative and try the much better results and no waste ,disappointed , not as good as i be
they work great now i can use my on coffee and that is nice only four cup filter coffee lid ,disposakups , great product
not thrilled with these doubt i will buy them again lid does not fit very well messy and did not make a good cup of coffee cost including shipping to me was filter cup plus coffee do not think it is worth it as i can buy a green mountain k cup for around cup and they are perfect every time ,review , good coffee
we have a michigan based coffee cafe now that starbucks was originally named a name that encountered resistance as the spread their br dark roasts are to die for none of the k cups come close except possibly for g m espresso so this build it yourself k cup is a near perfect solution the downside is that the brewing takes much longer and there is a bit of also the caps are a bit difficult to snap down recommended ,a perfect solution , great coffee
i bought these to be able to use my favorite and the expensive of the prefilled k cups it little bit more time consuming than the prefilled cups but if you make several at a time they work great ,inexpensive and works great , great product
the disposakups are great because i can use my own brand coffee and adjust the strength of it the only thing that needs to be improved on is that the edges of the filter need to be down to prevent leakage at first try it is a little difficult to get the tops on but after a few times of doing it it becomes easier the price is a little steep for me but much less than buying the already filled k kups i feel sure that i will order this product again br br a href http www amazon com gp product b disposakups for keurig k cup brewers cups lids filters disposable free prime shipping a ,disposakups k cups for keurig brewers , great product
this is a really good product i had a little trouble the first couple times because i didnt the lid down but besides that it is a good item ,great item , good
the disposable k cups allow me to use my own coffee with the keurig single cup coffee maker better than others i have tried ,disposable k cups , great coffee
these disposable cups are great the simple clean method of a portion pack but with your own grounds now i need to see if they pack them in larger quantities the seller was also great i got what i wanted and ahead of time also no issues to report here anyone with the k cup system needs to get this product from this seller ,disposable k cups for keurig brewers , great product
we ordered these because we love our new keurig coffee maker but as we drink alot of coffee found that buying the kcups are way too expensive with these we can use our regular coffee in these disposable cups they are still not fun to fill not as easy as just reaching for a pre made one but are far more economical than the pre made ones they delivery was on time and as promised ,we are pleased with purchase , great coffee
i really was not too sure this product would work it has surpassed all my expectations i will never buy the ready made k cups again this is truly a product ,much better than i , great product
they are everything i expected except for one flaw i had trouble keeping the completely down on the machine great product and my brother was excited also and i gave him a box i hope they are in stores soon such an ease to use great idea no clean up just throw away ,c from , great product
works great seems to work wonders lid is tight and some times hard to put on when you get the hang of it easy i will buy again ,great product , great product
purchased these for our new coffee machine they work very good no issues using these with our regular coffee is a plus ,disposakups review , great coffee
these were just what i was looking for however when using in my cuisinart they leak and back up water which out in different areas of my k cup area i do not want to ruin my machine so i am trying different things with this disposable cup i e smaller amount of coffee packing it and smaller amount of water for cup size still leaks some but it is getting better as before i had about to areas of dripping water coffee some inside the coffee cup and several outside of coffee cup ,k cups disposable , good coffee but not a great price
i am impressed at how easy these are to use much better than the one that you can buy from keurig br great company to buy from when i go through these will reorder again ,great item great customer service , great
i had a before and it broke the company said it was because i was using expresso in the k cup and it was to fine and the machine does not make a k cup with spanish coffee so when i found these i was very happy i have been using these for about a month and i love them and it is so much cheaper i would highly recommend these ,love it , good coffee
i love these cups my husband and i like community coffee from back home unfortunately no in their line yet these are perfect they perform just as as the standard k cups with the economy and of your own bulk coffees ,great product , great coffee
i have not had a to actually try the k cups to see if they work as advertised however the order arrived on time and in excellent condition for this a gave the star rating if the cups work as advertised then this rating will jump to stars ,delivery and only review , not as good as it is
http www amazon com gp product b k ref cm cr prod title br br http www amazon com gp product b k ref cm cr prod title br this product i highly reccommend i recieved my first cups and filled them with my own coffee and they worked great i now ordered another cups i liked them so much and not only that do the math br cups for and change vs cups for and change br br and i will continue to order again thank u for coming up with this ,disposakups for my keurig , great coffee
directions and read reviews to see what works best but was not able to use the k cups effectively the cup itself is too weak and in my machine i compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference this k cup seems to expand and because the plastic is not strong enough also the k cup is shaped differently from the traditional k cup this is because it does not use foil as a topper but does not seem to work in the end i had to clean up several coffee in my kitchen to figure out how it works but still could not use it effectively maybe i am not doing something correctly but i am sure there is also an issue with the product itself while i do like the idea i would not suggest purchasing this product until the bugs are worked out ,good idea but is not strong enough , good but not great
love these cups i hated paying so much for my beloved keurig coffees the cups work great they are convenient easy to use and i can use whatever coffee i choose ,love disposakups , great coffee
my family has been enjoying bug bites organic chocolates for years i highly recommend both the milk chocolate and the dark chocolate varieties they are very smooth and rich and not the least bit waxy tasting like some of the more popular american chocolates each individually packaged bite is the perfect size for an adult and maybe a little more than a mouthful for a young child each tiny package contains a special treat a tiny insect card which features a color and interesting facts if you have a on your hands these are the perfect treat the species company is environmentally conscious too and of their net profit to support species and ,sooo good , great product
the candy is ordinary milk chocolate but i was very glad to have an organic option to hand out for halloween i love the idea of including a little nature with it but i was a little disappointed in the text on the insect card i saw which was not well written and had almost nothing to do with the that was pictured but it is more than you get with most candy ,a nice organic option , not as good as it is
i hate bugs but i adore these bug bites chocolate squares the chocolate is smooth and sweet and small enough to be a daily indulgence plus each square comes with a tiny insect with a photo and for your favorite br br pull the trigger on this one your sweet tooth will thank you ,delicious and , great taste
i put this in my dog stocking for christmas he was very pleased with the snack he likes regular sweet potato fries so i thought a package of dog ones would make him happy ,dog was pleased , my dog loves these
i bought these for my pittie who is on a sweet potato and fish diet i thought they would be a little larger but they are more suitable for a smaller breed dog they were even a little small for my pug who them down and i was afraid she would choke on them ,odd , great product
this was a new product for our kids they liked them so well we even thought of trying them great price and obviously a new favorite ,tasty treat , great snack
covered raisins for something so simple it is surprising how difficult it is to find one that is truly exceptional in some the chocolate is too waxy and tasteless in others the raisins are too small or dried out kirkland chocolate covered raisins are just right the raisins are large and moist and the chocolate is high quality i used to think that made a good one until i had these br br if you or someone you know is a chocolate covered raisin fan this is one you must try the tub is huge and the price is less than want for a small bag of theirs it is an outstanding value and i doubt you will be disappointed br br i have no with kirkland or anyone else i am just a chocolate raisin fan who knows when he has a great raisin and these are truly wonderful ,my favorite chocolate , good but not as good as it is
these are definitely the best chocolate raisins out there they are the perfect balance of chocolate and raisin and my boyfriend will not have any others too many brands have a ton of chocolate around an raisin what is the point these are great and a treat ,the best chocolate , great taste
when i was in high school my mother would always have these around the house living in the i usually only ever find small overpriced packages of chocolate covered this is perfect for satisfying my cravings it stores very well i have had mine about a month and they taste the same as when i first opened them delicious ,perfect , great taste
these chocolate covered raisins are amazing there is a nice balance between raisins and chocolate i always pick up a container when i am shopping at bj wholesale ,delicious , great taste
i have ordered these raisins multiple times they are always great and arrive timely i cannot go back to store bought chocolate covered raisins now love this product ,delicious , great taste
oh dear there are not words to express my feelings for this product it is absolutely terrific the chocolate melts in your mouth the perfect raisin inside you can let them sit in your mouth and savor the moment or chew through two quickly before throwing more in your mouth i usually do the latter br br i ve never been able to find a comparable milk chocolate raisin product so i always end up coming back to these they are sold at big discount and also on amazon perfect ,the best , great product
i thought i was purchasing a high quality item but it is not all that the chocolate is very sweet and as you chew on this product you can tell the chocolate is loaded with sugar by the crunchy texture i am going to say it is not worth the money and i am not satisfied br at the same time of purchasing this product i also bought chocolate covered which i rate from a a now we are talking about br so customers if you are going to choose let it be the you will not be dissappointed ,chocolate tastes cheap , not as good as it is
have to buy special dog food for my dog because he has allergies to chicken and brown rice br my vet prescribed an iams brand food with meat in it my dog did not really care for the taste but he ate it br i wanted something more natural so i looked up river ranch fish chips what me is how you have to your dog off of the old food br to gradually get used to the new he liked the flavor so much he ate around the old dog food and only ate the river fish chips fortunately his tummy br the new food really well we have no problem getting him to eat and i like that he does not have to eat a larger serving to get the same nutrition i will definitely order br river ranch fish chips again and soon i recommend it highly ,my dog loves it , my dog loves it

a friend gave me a tea bag to try while at work yesterday i accidentally the tea and expected a very strong bitter brew i was very happy with the smoothness of this tea while it was quite strong nothing was overpowering and the bitterness i expected was not present at all br br my nd brewing was done with more care this tea has an exceptionally smooth taste and excellent flavor i will be buying ahmad tea in the future ,excellent , great tea
i just loved the tea we just add a little honey and sit back and relax it has a slight citrus flavor which i find very ,excellent taste , great tea
of money looking for a great earl grey to this point its been loose leaf tea i order from another site until my girl friend went to london with her family bring me back a small sample pack of tea bags i loved it so much i had gotten this pack of count boxes which i have off and reordered since then br br the tea stays fresh in the foil package each tea bag which makes it so air and light cant damage the flavor of the tea which is the problem is loose leaf tea br br the flavor of the tea is a nice bergamot flavor which is smooth no matter how long you leave the tea in i mine strong and straight up each sit is as good as the first i will keep buying this tea and also try other ones by ahmad of london ,love for earl grey , great for the tea
i love ahmad tea the earl grey is a wonderful tea for an afternoon sipping the bergamot flavour is not overpowering like some other brands i have tried br br i will be buying more of this wonderful tea ,good cuppa tea , great tea
presentation is perfect and product really fresh tea bags came inside aluminum bag making them to be ever fresh i will buy other kind of teas from this seller hopefully they must be as excellent as the earl grey one ,outstanding tasty product , great product
having tried a very large number of earl grey teas i have been struck by how particularly flavorful this brand is it is really worth trying i ended up buying the pack of boxes twice i liked it so much ,great tea extremely flavorful , great product
for any tea lover we became fans in england ahmad tea immensely i we have sampled tea from quite a few vendors but after our son brought a pack of ahmad tea back with him from jolly old as a gift we were sold we found the flavor splendid we loved it it is fully flavored and needs no sugar milk sweetener at all and i usually needed sweeteners with the other brands of earl grey so br buying it from amazon is a very economical solution and delivery was i highly recommend if you enjoy hot tea try this brand br mac br please excuse any that may have occurred in my and no check help ta ta earl grey hot ,tea , great tea
this is my wife absolute favorite earl grey me i find that while the bergamot flavor is nice i like a tea base that is a bit ,decent earl grey , great product
purchase this month will be similar to the one i bought six months ago all things remaining the same in my experience i have had ahmad earl grey tea that is knocked off my socks with a rich flavor filled with the bergamot that me to earl grey the box i am currently drinking is so full of and void of essence of bergamot that i do not know if it will actually be drunk all boxes i have had contained tea bags with an ample amount of tea and each produces a satisfactory little full of caramel colored tea but i am having difficulty drinking the second cups from this box because the tea powder residue remains instead of enjoying an afternoon of relaxation i develop a stomach ache so i am now skipping the entire second cup the tea was recently purchased so is likely not an issue ,in my experience , good for the
nice serving size good complement to breakfast low in fat high in protein and taste great i keep the unused portion in the freezer and microwave them or heat them in a pan if you want a crispier outside they are pre cooked love em ,very tasty , good but not great
made in china br even our dog food has gone the way of the hershey kiss i will not be back to this vendor br will be looking for made and sold in america only ,sticks pack of , my dog loves it
my experience br br it very with just a light golden color it smells like you would expect a peach to smell but the taste hints of a white grape juice though it has no grape in it and tastes more over time especially as it up it is tingly on the tongue but does not foam up it is slightly drier than your average juice with a hint of bitterness probably from the carbonation br br did i like it yes though not as much as their offering in pomegranate apple a out of my wife does not like it so much ,good , not as good as it is
i love black sparkling drink so thought i would try the peach i never know if i am going to get a syrupy sweet flavor when i get peach flavored items but this was really good somewhat tart and tastes like fresh peaches the bubbles are tiny so not like regular sodas but a grown up sparkling beverage i will order this again and would have no trouble giving this as a gift if i did not drink it all first i hope amazon gets the pear flavored not the listing for bucks either i am sure that would be good as well but the peach and black are definite ,light fresh flavor , the best licorice i have ever had
was surprised of the inexpensive price tag and skeptical when purchased as it turns out it is a charming and unique gift and a great buy for the price ,gift , great product
really good mix pleasantly surprised to find it includes macadamia nuts we will enjoy this mix immensely i am sure we will order it again ,great tasty mix , great product
this is a fantastic product arrived fresh and it is a good price with subscribe and save i will be keeping this subscription ,yummy , great product
i eat mixed nuts all the time at work they make a healthy snack instead of the donuts etc that are always around the plus side of these is that they are much lower salt than usual the down side is that they are almost all cashews very few brazil nuts pecans and it is a miracle to find a macadamia nut the lack of variety is disappointing ,disappointed , not as good as
the price was comparable to walmart for same size product however these nuts were not as crunchy and they needed a little more salt ,too bland , good but not great
i thought these had good flavor i took two tubs to work and most of the people liked them two or three people commented that they liked them better than some other brands because they are not salty ,good flavor and not too salty , good
they do not taste like a good high quality nut i dont know if it was the lack of salt but they were not for me ,not that great , not as good as it
i would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts these are just average quality and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful the only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans there are barely any pecans but tons of cashews try another brand as i am sure there is something better out there ,not bad not great just average , not as good as it is
these are a cheap fake nothing like the real nuts you buy in the store its a complete waste of money dont get ripped off like i did ,no good , not as good as it
the stuff is great but i will pay at most or for four bottles ,overpriced , great
the grapefruit and blackberry flavors are the current favorite at my house on nights when we try to always have a chicken and homemade gravy while watching tv br br once you taste the subtle fruit flavors perfectly in a not overly carbonated sparkling water you may want to order this by the case br br there are no artificial flavorings or colorings not to mention extra sugar the only sweetener is grape juice and apple juice concentrate lemon juice and fruit concentrates with the sparkling water to create a delicate smooth slightly tingly and delicious drink br br perfect for drinking with dinner or taking along on a picnic br br the rebecca review ,smooth and slightly , great product
i just purchased this today for i cannot believe this price the product is wonderful however nice soda like fizz but juicy instead of sweet ,how much , great taste
then fresca and not a very strong grapefruit flavor at all i found it to lack in the grapefruit flavor but more of a peach flavor to be honest i have not tried the peach one yet but i am guessing it tastes like the grapefruit one d lol oh well i am just not a big fan of peach drinks if you are someone who likes a milder taste of grapefruit then you will love this its very smooth i dont like very smooth so this is not my favorite i like my drink to have a bite to it it is ok but i will stick to blueberry and apple from now on the really awesome thing about these drinks though is they are lower calorie then your normal juice all natural and no added sugar and each glass bottle has servings of fruit you cant beat that ,not my favorite flavor , not bad but not as good as it is
izze sparkling grapefruit soda is absolutely delicious even though it is not flavored with grapefruit juice it is amazing that such a strong mellow grapefruit taste can come from a mixture of fruit juices however the effect is great not too tart not too sweet and wonderfully refreshing br br it perfect on its own own or with a snack because it is not overpowering it is just the right touch to add to your meals if you are tired of drinking beverages with ingredients that you cannot pronounce izze sparkling grapefruit soda is the drink for you br br it a healthy alternative to chemical laden sodas ,delicious , the best soda i have ever tasted
this product is excellent at my local store they struggle to keep enough on the shelves it is usually priced at for bottles which is expensive as it is i would try not to spend more than this ,excellent but try to find it , great product
addicted to the stuff a very unhealthy habit br br i cannot drink soda pop myself it is been years or so since i had one and so i began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop but was not unhealthy i searched high and low for a suitable alternative and then i found izze br br i love the fruity tangy flavor of izze sparkling soda the grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods but it is also great just by itself br br my teens love izze and drink it now just like soda pop i am so happy to know they are not down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors but instead are enjoying all natural izze with no added br br if you are looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop you cannot do better than to buy izze ,a great healthy alternative to soda pop , a great product
izze is fantastic i tried it three days ago and have not been anywhere without a can or bottle of it since it could quite possibly be the world most perfect beverage nothing artificial ingredients that you can pronounce and a taste you just cannot beat slightly tart and slightly sweet this light bubbly drink should be experienced by everyone at least once ,amazing this is one delicious drink , not as good as it is
few more natural ingredients beside fruit juice and water in these drinks but the description is apt in that izze drinks are more sparkling fruit juices than sodas they are lightly carbonated not super fizzy and the best of them taste like fresh fruit the sparkling grapefruit will be a fast favorite of grapefruit fans because it tastes like fresh squeezed pink grapefruit juice but lighter and a little sweeter it is a little tart a little sweet a little fizzy very refreshing it is like drinking fresh grapefruit juice only better there is never any trace of sourness no refined sugar artificial ingredients or caffeine either fl oz glass bottles br br ingredients sparkling water grape juice concentrate grape fruit juice concentrate lemon juice concentrate natural flavor gum acacia from acacia trees gum red extract color one serving which is fl oz contains mg sodium and g total carbs ,like fresh juice but better , not bad but not bad
if you are a chamomile tea drinker you will be happy to discover this tea the citrus addition makes for a full bodied but smooth tea definitely the best chamomile tea on the market also i brew one bag in a coffee maker to tea only and get a whole pot out of each bag you will not be disappointed in this one ,best on market , great tea
this tea was a gift we are down to the last two tea bags and i had been unable to find it alas it was on the find anything site amazon this particular herbal blend does not sound particularly appealing but one taste and you will be hooked a smooth complex blend just lovely ,if you think you do not like tree think again , good tea
our little chihuahuas are picky eaters i really do not find canned foods helpful since they will not eat any that has been put in the refrigerator overnight these are perfect because we can split a single package and mix it in with the kibble even better when we travel these are easy to open and carry br br of all of the selections the beef chicken combo is their favorite they always gobble this one up right away ,their favorite , great for
i must be in love if i am over a pack of big bags for myself i love the crunch intense curry flavor and the fact they are gluten free these are one of the more original savory snacks you can find they are very hard so you need good teeth and i love the substantial curry flavor that is not kind of indian tasting ,like an meal in a , delicious
i just love these have tried several flavors gives a gluten a chance to snack on a crunchy healthy snack ,delicious gluten free snack , delicious
i have been snacking on the crackers from this line for a long time now and someone suggested that i try these sticks i love everything about them i love the crunch and the texture of them and of course i love the taste of them especially with the curry flavor they are not only delicious but they are also very with lots of protein and fiber in them they make the perfect snack ,my new favorite snack , great snack
sticks and may seem a little pricey compared to regular pretzels but the bag lasts a long time and the ingredients like flax seeds quinoa chia seeds and curry are good for you they are very crunchy but tasty for some added protein i like to dip them in peanut butter ,tasty healthy snack , good for you
picked these up on a recent trip loved the spice br br organic non gmo vegan dairy free wheat free gluten free whole grain kosher no hydrogenated oils no trans fats and contains mg of omega fatty acids per oz serving extremely crunchy and satisfying using organic short grain brown rice organic whole quinoa organic brown flax seeds organic brown sesame seeds organic whole organic whole filtered water sea salt organic curry powder organic chia seeds and that is all br br if you are accustomed to eating healthy whole foods and have good teeth you will adore these for snacking ,organic with potato corn or , great for the price
i was extremely impressed with the single serve pecan pies i expected a middle of the road product thought i would give them a try br the ratio of filling to crust thickness is perfect pie has a rich home baked flavor and the size is wonderful ounces is large enough to enjoy without diet it is satisfying without being overly sweet br i will be ordering more next month to give one to each guest to take home after thanksgiving dinner ,rich , not as good as it is
my father lives miles from me and i used to order a pecan pie from swiss and have it shipped to him for christmas each year but when the item was discontinued a few years ago i had trouble finding another company that could deliver a delicious homemade pie that was guaranteed to be fresh when it arrived i gave davis a shot last christmas and could not have been more pleased i missed the to guarantee the order would arrive by christmas but sure enough my father was quite surprised when he got not one but six mini pies on christmas eve morning he said they were wonderful and he gobbled down all six in one sitting i have definitely found my new holiday pie company thank you davis ,new , great product
ok this poor guy my daughter to make him my pecan pie and well she is a microwave girl so for what better way to a man than his stomach he now has pies he can pack in his lunch box they are good ,gift for a , great product
they were packaged so perfect and omg if there were stars i would give them stars they are out of this world the crust melts in you mouth and the filling is perfect and delicious and scrumptious the filling is not yet not too sweet i used to make them when i was a kid with my mother for christmas but they never came out like these i bet there is not one comment that is less than they taste just like they look they are beyond delicious and i allow myself one or two a day if you are about how good they are one bite and you will know ,about the product packaged and taste , not as good as i have
unfortunately i am completely disappointed with this product i have an above average sense of smell but this extract has hardly any detectable flavor in the bottle and none whatsoever once added to food perhaps i received part of a faulty batch the seller is letting me return the bottle but is requiring that i pay for shipping again so i would be very unlikely to order from them again ,almost no flavor , not as good as it is
lacks the flavor i was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level i will not be ordering this again live and learn ,quite disappointing , not as good as it is
we only like white popcorn and the only grocery store option where we live is jolly time which is not bad for fun we started ordering various white popcorns online and this is by far the very best white popcorn wish it were a little less expensive but we have decided that it really is that much better than others we are now snappy white popcorn ,best popcorn we have ever used , best popcorn ever
snappy white popcorn is excellent it pops up nicely and has a great texture it is extremely fresh as for taste it is times better than the store brands imo give it a try ,great popcorn , best popcorn ever

having no idea what i was doing and i have to say that no other popcorn compares we went through the entire container when i re ordered i decided to try the regular yellow popcorn and it just was not the same if i could describe the difference i would say that yellow popcorn tastes stale in comparison the white popcorn tastes and more fresh br br as for the flavor well we use kernel seasons seasoning generously so we do not taste much more than the cheddar cheese br br i m considering giving the rest of this yellow popcorn tub away so i have an excuse to buy another tub of the white popcorn br br for how we eat it this popcorn is absolutely the best br br note i also recommend the oil spray we use this and kernel seasons as a healthy alternative to butter ,you must try this popcorn , best popcorn i have ever had
just ate my first batch and it is as good as any white popcorn i have had i encountered difficulty obtaining white popcorn from grocery stores and was reduced to eating the horrible yellow type luckily i decided to shop this site and i could not be more pleased you will not be disappointed br br next time i will order two four pound jars plus the snappy popcorn white cheddar shaker and get free shipping for a purchase over which is important because the shipping charges are significant ,great white popcorn , best popcorn ever
snappy white popcorn is perfect it is hulless tiny tender and crunchy when popped and it always pops we keep it in the freezer so it is always fresh and more importantly always here when we want some as we know corn okay and this is the best ,perfect popcorn , best popcorn ever
i tried popcorn in a the presto air popcorn machine the instructions were easy and the results were very i added sea salt and a little olive oil the measuring container made quarts i just could not stop eating it simply delicious ,white popcorn , best popcorn ever
this popcorn leaves very few old it is fresh so the kernels pop as bi as they should unlike some other brands i have purchased my only criticism is that there are lots of hulls but of the three brands of popcorn i have recently bough for use in my microwave popcorn popper it is the best ,fresh , best popcorn ever
i am on my second lb canister of this the popcorn has a good yield few unpopped similar to popcorn from the grocery store the popped are larger than normal for most white popcorn br br i have mild ibs and i find white popcorn is easier on my digestive track versus yellow i think because the shells are thinner and softer this popcorn follows the trend for me and i can consume popcorn every day when i am in a popcorn mood ,great popcorn , best popcorn ever
for my daughter birthday i ordered her a stir crazy popcorn maker i was busy and knew i did not have time to run to the grocery store i ordered the popcorn on line too we made the popcorn using organic coconut oil we were shocked to see almost every kernel popped cup and the popper was full the popcorn was big and fluffy the flavor was good the first time we put butter and salt on it the second time just salt and it was great we placed it in baggies and took it to the movies okay so maybe that sounds a bit cheap however our popcorn was fresh tasty and healthy as compared to the movie theater popcorn ,a little this on line , best popcorn ever
we are white popcorn and were very pleased with this product large tender kernels of corn used an electric self stirring worth the cost ,good quality , best popcorn ever
snappy white popcorn is one of the best popcorn i have ever tried very tasty and most every kernel pops every time ,great popcorn and a great value , best popcorn ever
i was sick of microwave popcorn so i ordered this hoping it would take me back to the popcorn i loved in years past that it did almost every kernel pops and with butter i am happy br i get my oil hot first and pop about a third of a cup of corn each time it pops quickly just be there to get it into a bowl as soon as the popping stops or it will burn ,pops to the last , best popcorn ever
i love this brand i ordered st via amazon great fluffy corn with very few un popped kernels in my hot air popper did not try the old fashioned fry pan method but expect similar results definitely will buy again when needed ,it is great , great stuff
very good popcorn i believe even better than orville brand a little on the expensive side but you do get a lot of popcorn ,popcorn , best popcorn ever
i bought this with the presto microwave multi popper back in july and have been very very pleased almost no kernels left in the bottom and fluffy large popcorn getting ready to reorder so i thought i would pass it on a href http www amazon com gp product b presto microwave multi popper a ,great , best popcorn ever
my sister turned me on to white popcorn over yellow popcorn br br she said it was more tender however did not pop as large br br guess she had some store bought stuff br br i put the same amount in as world yellow popcorn and it blew the lid off the pot br br i m a convert to this brand of white popcorn ,world , best popcorn ever
this popcorn pops up light fluffy and crunchy i have been using orville redenbacher white popcorn but this is slightly less expensive and very tasty and fresh my popcorn method is as follows br use a stir crazy qt popper it is the best because it gets hot quickly without smoking or burning the corn br then use tablespoons of olive oil flavacol to taste i use about a teaspoon put the oil and flavacol in the popper and plug it in add approximately cup of snappy white popcorn when the popping stops enjoy a large batch of great popcorn with very little fat and what fat there is will be a href http www amazon com gp product b r west stir crazy quart electric popcorn popper a a href http www amazon com gp product b w lt gold prod flavacol seasoning popcorn salt oz a ,my new favorite popcorn , the best popcorn ever
we only like white popcorn and since it is hard to find in the grocery store it is great to order this it was yummy and plentiful recommend ,good popcorn , best popcorn ever
good big crisp white kernels with few pops quickly faster than name brand yellow corn in the same microwave and popper decent price and package size enough to last awhile not so much as to go stale before it runs out br br bad almost tasteless butter and salt are not optional br br orville redenbacher still leads the pack but this stuff is pretty good and costs a lot less four stars would have been five if it were even a little less bland ,pretty good stuff , not as good as it is
i ordered several kinds of highly rated popcorn from amazon at one time i admit i was skeptical of some of the rave reviews well the snappy white popcorn arrived first so i tried it immediately i actually measured i usually just eye ball it t canola oil cup snappy popcorn and tsp flavacol flavored salt i put the oil and flavacol in my pop popper and swirled to the flavacol i then added the popcorn it popped really quickly white and fluffy it was divine tender not greasy or chewy and so flavorful i will update this post when i try the other brands i ordered to let you know how it up oh and i had one kernel that did not pop ,no longer a , best popcorn ever
this is the white popcorn we ate in years ago i am so glad to find it and what a great price too br i got it today and popped some right away i used the microwave popcorn bowl i bought from amazon put a of extra virgin olive oil and two of the popcorn in the bowl br i placed the bowl with lid on in the and turned it on for minute and then pushed the popcorn button to pop it br after moving the popped corn to another bowl i the shaker with the popcorn seasoning several times and oh what a delicious hulless treat the hulls seem to have during the popping i felt nor found any br and all of the items i used including the microwave i bought from amazon ,white tasty and popcorn , best popcorn ever
this is great popcorn i just purchased a second batch i never had a problem w a ton of kernels left in my air popper or many hulls as long as this is being produced and sold i will be a buyer br br the only con i have is that the only seal on the canister is a small piece of tape on the lid canister i was surprised to not see some type of freshness seal like you would see on a ketchup bottle surprisingly though i had no issues with humidity the corn maybe because i am in a dryer climate ,customer , great stuff
i ordered this popping corn after being disappointed with the local big box store selection two brands one of them tasted chalky like styrofoam and its claim was larger popped kernels no taste br br i mainly use this popcorn with one of those plastic microwave popping bowls i noticed that cup yields more cooked popcorn than two other brands i have tried it kept on popping after my usual minute and second routine when using microwave poppers you tend to get some burnt kernels if you extend the cooking time for maximum popped corn the snappy burnt kernels did not taste as bad as other brands br br this white popcorn tasted great with canola oil and even better when popped with coconut oil ,works great with , best popcorn ever
this is the best white popcorn yet i have tried the others sold on amazon there is no comparison it was fluffy flavorful almost every kernel popped how often can you say that i have already ordered more so i will not run out ,the best , best popcorn ever
good product almost all the popcorn pops up fluffy and snow white with our air popper great snack with few calories taste great ,white popcorn , best popcorn ever
all of the positive reviews led me to believe this popcorn was going to be really great truth is i am disappointed the popcorn kernels are tough chewy and lack any great corn taste i want popcorn that snaps when you bite into it i will go back to buying the premium orville redenbacher brand at my local grocery ,disappointed , best popcorn ever
so far i am not impressed with this popcorn it is tender when popped but it is really annoying how much does not pop i am going to add a little water and then let it sit closed up for a while and see if that helps as of right now i would not buy this popcorn again ,lots of , best popcorn ever
these are supposed to be cherry and brandy filled chocolates if they contain brandy it is too subtle for me to detect a to the cause may be the of the package and the cracks in the candies it appears they were at some point and may have leaked but the box they came in shows no damage a friend that airline burst them maybe but other imported chocolates do not suffer this problem br br i should also mention that the chocolate tastes a little bit on the outside br br i cannot really recommend these candies there are other brands which are quite good ,disappointing , not as good as it is
if you enjoy a rich flavored cheddar cheese with a bite of horseradish i would give this a try it was a instant party favorite when i brought this and crackers to friends house i would recommend this to anyone ,the best cheese you will ever eat , great taste
i enjoyed the dry roasted part but the onion garlic combination was a little overwhelming for me i thought that they would be a little more toasted than they were the flavor was more of an after taste and my wife away from my after i ate them bummer i am looking for something else ,onion garlic dry soy nuts ok but not great , not as good as it is
love these soy nuts especially the garlic and onion blend perfect for taking to a party or just snacking on while on the go been happy with every product from ,organic fresh crunchy , great taste
the onion garlic soy nuts are my favorite they add a great hit of flavor to salads and the added bonus is they are good for you ,love the onion garlic , great product
i like the onion garlic flavor it really tastes good very fresh and it is much healthier for you than other non organic soy nuts i like to add them to my salads instead of ,great garlic flavor , great taste
this is a very good gingerbread mix lots of flavor and easy to make it is probably a bit overpriced but i was having alot of difficulty finding any gingerbread mix in the grocery store i use this mix to make gingerbread muffins with diced pears and dried cranberries i will purchase another six boxes when i run out of mix a good buy and good product ,treat , great product
this packaging is awesome my main with regular jolly is that if you keep them in your pocket they will melt and stick to the wrapper and eventually stick to your pocket not delicious this packaging completely fixes all that it is the size of a pack of gum and the candies do not stick to anything br br clearly not the healthiest thing to eat but if you are on your feet all day long and often find yourself without a meal for hours these could be a convenient quick fix for when you start to feel all weird and and br br totally no nutrition in these but they are great for when you need a bit of glucose boost ,quick boost with no , not as good as i be
these crackers are made from whole flax seeds so they are not like your usual chip or cracker some people i have shared them with do not care for them at all but some loved them i am on a raw food diet and i use them as chips to eat with guacamole or or other raw dips raw meals sometimes take a lot of advance preparation and when you are really hungry these will fill you up fast just make sure you drink a lot of water and do not eat too many at once i personally liked all the flavors the onion was just a bit strong for some but i thought it was ok will definitely be buying again ,some getting used to but i love them now , not as good as i be
love them i love knowing how much better this is for me than potato chips or typical crackers i am on eating nutrient dense food and am avoiding putting into my mouth non food items for only i love crunchy foods and this is great the flavors are all good except do not like the sweet maple and flavor as much br my family doesnt like them because they are not yet taste buds is all i can say at this point start your babies off early and you will not have to habits of eating non food for fun ,love and hate in same family , great taste
they do get stuck in your teeth but hey that is flax seeds for you if you do not like or tolerate the texture of flaxseeds there is nothing these crackers can really do for you br br the flavors my favorite is the mexican flavor hands down a close second is the hemp rosemary and the cinnamon maple higher carb but only barely really i am not really a fan of the onion garlic and italian i love garlic but it is just too much the original flavor is icky it just tastes like soy sauce and flax meh i like soy sauce but it is not really an ideal flavor for crackers if you like japanese rice crackers you might like that flavor br br i think the cinnamon maple would probably be a fantastic flavor to spread nut on chocolate almond butter almond butter peanut butter whatever ,good for low nice strong flavors , this one of the
i do like the idea of these crackers for gluten free eating but i cannot bring myself to enjoy them i bought the pack variety and have tried the maple cinnamon and the onion garlic i generally like flax but these just are not setting well with me even when i use them as a for dips i feel i wasted my money i will probably give the unopened packs to a friend family that are gluten free ,i like the idea of these but , not as good as you are
the flavors are really good but the crackers get a bit slimy as you chew them if that does not bother you then they are a great low carb snack ,tasty buy , good
i loved the foods alive garlic and onion flavor flax crackers when i finished my entire order of bags i decided to try the mustard flavor since i love all on almost everything well i just finished my first bag of it last night and it is ok organic crisp fresh for sure but does not compare to the strong powerful garlic onion flavor maybe the mustard is too mild on my palate but i just thought the flavor was too bland for my taste br br if you like a mild mustard always wanted to try organic flax crackers made with pure ingredients no fillers or chemicals then this flavor is for you and i would recommend that you try it ,love mustard but this flavor is too mild for my taste , good but not great
makes great nut their chocolate version is like should be less sugar and other crap delicious and super nutritious ,quality nut , delicious
i bought a bottle of hot sauce for my friend to have it shipped over to her in the east coast the order said it would take business days it ended up taking over weeks ,forever , great hot chocolate
i love this tea and have no complaints i just want to comment on how the tea is packaged it comes loose in little plastic baggies so if you want to use it you have to have some sort of filter we have an iced tea maker and used a cone coffee filter which works just fine i did buy a inch tea ball but the loose tea just falls right through it so i guess i did not buy the right thing ,great tea but need a , great tea
some people mentioned the loose tea is difficult to filter br br use a french press made for coffee is a good option dilute concentrate to desire strength my favorite flavors are mango and passion fruit ,good tea use french to , good tea
my whole family is addicted to this tea we make it in our mr coffee iced tea maker it is fabulous ,just like a , great taste
we are big fans of the passion fruit tea but wanted to try something different i like all of the flavors but the blackberry is my fave for a change of pace still got to have the passion fruit as the go to tea though everyone about how good this stuff is i cannot make enough ,variety pack is yummy , not as good as it is
many food serve tea and i love br the flavor i was happy to be able to purchase it on amazon br i make it my iced tea maker it is so easy and has a great br taste with less caffeine try it you will love it too ,china is the best tea , great tea
decent every day loose leaf tea the china mist brand is good the only downside is some of the tea is too fine so there is in the tea i recommend letting the tea settle before serving china mist is not extremely high quality just a nice every day tea that tastes fine the sample pack gives you a chance to try some variety and it lasts a while ,good value , great tea
there i will have coffee with a cup of water on top br br the second part of the review concerns our hamilton beach iced tea machine we add the recommend water and ice cubes and the brewing cycle indeed does take only minutes the tea is already ice cold it may be the difference between a home level heat limit or maybe the fact that the water is not over the tea as much as it might be in a commercial machine or maybe the commercial machines are much better around the steeping container our hamilton beach unit made a weaker tea than i would have liked we will reduce the amount of water from now on and see what that does in the beach iced tea make was commercial models are or more but they brew their stronger teas in only versus minutes a wildly expensive two minutes ,almost perfect , it is
i purchased this product mainly to try out the different flavors of tea when i find the flavor i like i will probably buy a case of it china mist tea taste great as for those who have problems with tea leaves getting in the tea do not worry i went to the local supermarket heb in texas and found empty tea bags in a box for about they work great fill with tea and fold top and staple ,excellent product , great tea
you know i really do love this product i wish i could give the tea stars because it really does brew up a very pleasant tasting iced tea that needs little sugar or other the problem is it is loose and when you are trying to make a big jug of it with two packets of tea it is a huge mess to strain and ordinary double mesh strainer is not fine enough i do not have coffee in the house so i had to line a mess strainer with paper towels and it took forever to strain but when i it with just my mesh strainer there was a ton of tea in the jug i wish the variety pack came pre bagged like the smaller boxes of tea do ,great taste to , great tea
i bought this item thinking it might be to starbucks or hazelnut syrup but it is not at first it tastes like hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale the price is only slightly better than what i can get the brand at sam club but the quality is far lower in my opinion for hazelnut fans i suggest avoiding this particular brand ,more like pancake syrup , not as good as it is
i am sorry i bought this brand it leaves a lousy after taste in your mouth no wonder amazon is giving cent shipping on this item stay away avoid ,star to much , not as good as it is
the flavor of big train hazelnut is not significant one has to add a lot to have a flavor impact of the three big train flavors i purchased including vanilla and irish creme hazelnut is the least satisfactory vanilla a little better irish creme is best i gave that one stars ,mediocre , best ever
i use this syrup in tea coffee and over cut up fruit and ice cream i buy unflavored creamer and add this to it much cheaper alternative to pre flavored coffee creamer ,versatile to kitchen favorites , great tea
i love cheese in general i have had lots of european cheeses and this one is outstanding br br the texture is a bit hard not creamy as french cheeses and the flavor is full and rich great to serve with some bread and of course some wine it is great with salads as well you will not need any dressing since the cheese is enough a good flavor enhancer by itself br br i have shared it with many guests and they all love it it is not salty like cheddar and smoked cheeses it is more of a refined goat milky flavor br br it always a success ,flavorful and natural goat cheese , delicious
so i had this cheese on my mind ever since trying it at a restaurant in this was one of those things that i though when im bored and want to burn money on shipping i would order is it worth it yes if you are a cheese fan goes great with any wine not so much if you are being curious ,worth the shipping , best ever
your guess is as good as mine regarding what festival means when they claim that their canned slices are fresh pack on a separate subject unlike brand of canned sliced festival brand does not add sesame oil which would make the mushrooms taste better but at the expense of adding calories from the bad fatty acid acid omega which is the only kind of fat contained in sesame oil ,does not tell us what they by fresh pack , not as good as it is
i tried this at first as a gluten free alternative to cream of mushroom soup turns out its really good modified my swedish meatballs recipe using this sauce as the base also served it with over rice very versatile and tasty and its great that the ingredients do not read like an ,really good gravy , great product
tea then white oolong and green tea i have discovered the loose fruit flavored green tea mixes sold by teavana which are delightful teavana makes tea drinking a pleasure with all the available and br br this green tea mix is flavored with apple pieces hibiscus flowers blackberries and blackberry flavoring raspberries plum pieces blossoms and spearmint and is called blackberry br br are nothing new in the tea world but teavana product is most fresh in the vacuum sealed pouches and has a wonderfully delicious fruity fragrance however as an infusion i found its slight astringent tartness somewhat which most likely stems from the rosehips peel perhaps other people prefer this if compared to the lipton fruit flavored green and white tea bags which are available now and look like little i have to say that i do prefer their taste but as a potpourri blackberry is the winner ,have a of tea , not as good as i like
i made the bean soup with a few modifications i added carrots onions celery and potatoes however i did not have to adjust the seasoning this is not a bland soup excellent i also gave women bean soups dips and salsas to my extended family for christmas everyone loved the gift it my shopping and i felt like i was helping those who really need the help ,well , not as good as it is
last night they an ice and i was going to have the day off for so i knew that this was the day to make soup this one is excellent my only addition to the recipe was a ham bone and about a cup of rice it made a great satisfying pat ,bean soup , good
i did not purchase this but received it as a christmas gift it was wonderful my husband actually made the soup he followed the directions added some ham and it was soup he did say that the beans seemed to get done quicker that he thought he would not them as suggested it is a great gift that not only gives to the recipient but helps women in need as well i would highly recommend it and will be purchasing some myself ,bean great gift idea , not as good as it is
if there is one good thing about a cold winter day it is hot soup the women bean project provided me with one of the best and it is good for me too how often can we do something that is good for us and so enjoyable at the same time br i have told all of my friends about it and i hope they will in turn spread the word so that the women of the bean project are kept busy and ,most enjoyable winter treat bean soup , great product

this coffee tastes pretty good and i like the fact that it is organic coffee has one of he highest rates of pesticides however each time i use subscribe save unfortunately the price seems to get raised substantially a few weeks later which is why i had to cancel my subscription to this ,decent tasting , good coffee
hooray for an all natural sweetner say goodbye to sugar and chemical based sweetners and get your hands on this stevia ,love me some stevia , great taste
my father in law bought some for me to try love it very sweet no aftertaste wonderful all natural sweetener my new choice replacing all those other artificial packets i used to use ,super sweet , great taste
i bought this vinegar along with others for my father for christmas i wish they could have all been shipped together but they went separately good vinegar though ,a beautiful vinegar , great product
big negative i have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it they are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around the mouth stains i used to buy all different flavors of iams savory sauce buy my told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face vitagravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins so if your must have some sort of gravy i recommend vitagravy a bit more or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog this creates a gravy like texture and aroma that most dogs love not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues but a great free solution for picky eaters ,decent but not great , great but not great
my wife had some white balsamic from a store in boston and loved it so i figured i would get her some for xmas but i could not get to boston this product and seller gave me a good alternative it is a fantastic product and she loves it we use it with lemon or other infused olive oils on salad or what have you nice ,nice , great product

highly recommend this brand of coffee for the and seasoned coffee drinker i dont know how they do it but these pre packaged can actually make pots of cup coffee the flavor is slightly bold but smooth as ever i actually dont even like to use cream or sugar with this flavor you can taste the flavors of butter rum coconut right in the cup smells incredible as its brewing however i personally use a coffee press and the flavor comes through even stronger again highly recommended no cons you will definitely enjoy this over the coffee plus this saves you money try it try it try it br br p s i also highly recommend the almond amaretto caramel kiss and butter pecan enjoy ,delicious flavorful big for your , not as good as i have

this is the best marinade to in a fried turkey ever made you do not have to add anything of your own maybe a little olive oil but that is all plus there is a shaker mix you can buy to sprinkle on the top of the turkey but this marinade can be to make a tender juicy fried turkey we loved it ,best for ever , great product
if you have tried pumpkin seeds in the past chances are they have been heavily salted seasoned and deprived of most nutritional value or had the taste and consistency of styrofoam fortunately neither description to these they are indeed raw but removed from the hull for easy eating no added salt or other chemicals just delicious and nutritious snack mix with raisins and or sunflower seeds for a healthy snack rich in zinc other vital nutrition or use with breads cereals and flavor for your favorite recipe ,delicious try these before buying other brands , good for you
red mill seeds are simply the best other seeds or pepitas do not come even close red mill seeds are crunchy and very tasty they are product of the u s not china like most pepitas well worth the price ,the best seeds , delicious
usually healthy food is hard to swallow not these fresh crunchy delicious pumpkin seeds i switched from potato chips and my wife tells me they are good for the what do i know i am taking her word for it ,and be healthy , great snack
i grind these seeds up in a coffee grinder give them to my dogs they are a natural add good fiber to their diet we have sauteed them with some seasonings in a pan the kids will eat them they taste similar to sunflower seeds you can also put them in the oven or eat them raw the seeds are good quality you do have to either freeze or refrigerate them to keep them fresh pretty expensive though ,versatile , great taste
i only ever had pumpkin seeds before in cereal in small amounts these are great just add them to bob granola or yogurt even just plain by the handful they are great ,taste good , great product
love bob the best of the best pay a little more than the other guys but all american and owned seeds are high on the calorie so just a teaspoon at a time ,the best , great stuff
also extremely nutritious high in iron protein and fiber actually pumpkin seed kernels have four times the iron and about more protein than beef per gram the price produces somewhat of a sticker shock though at over seven bucks per pound however considering all of the fiber and nutrients i believe they are well worth the price bob red mill has the nutrition facts on his web site i highly recommend these pumpkin kernels because they taste great and as you can from the facts below are at the top of the nutrition br br usda nutrition content seeds pumpkin and squash seed kernels dried br protein br fiber total dietary br food br br vitamin b br riboflavin br br vitamin c total ascorbic acid br vitamin a br vitamin e alpha br calcium ca br iron br phosphorus p br magnesium mg br copper br se br zinc ,very good flavor extremely nutritious worth the price , not as good as i be
these are not only one of the few pumpkin seeds grown in the usa they are great and fresh every time ,pumpkin seeds , great product
this product is great tasting i was eating the pepitas at half the price due to not finding usa made pumpkin seeds the pepitas tasted bitter and were much larger i hope red mill continues to make their pumpkin seeds in the usa it is worth the higher price for excellent quality and supporting local usa companies ,bob red mill seeds great product , great product
because these are more expensive than some of the other brands i decided to order since they had great reviews and are a product of the usa i am sure glad i did because these are delicious my whole family likes them straight out of the package we have not yet taken the time to roast them ,i almost did not order , good for you
i sprinkle these on oat or just grab a handful and munch i the contents of the package to a ziplock once i opened it and keep it in the freezer to ensure freshness ,eat them up yum , great taste
in oregon br br i took the plunge and ordered bags of these seeds and they arrived in less than hours br four sealed bags were also in a sealed bob red mill box and then packaged in a larger amazon box br br i just opened one bag of the seeds to try them they are way better than what i was getting at my local whole food store in bulk these seeds are chewy as they should be and not hard or stale with any off taste br these have a slight pumpkin taste which they should have this variety of seed is and than some of the other pumpkin seed varieties i have had which i like no ends to me as i am munching them down br all in all a great buy br br seeds stars br grown in the usa stars br total stars ,great healthy snack , not as good as i be

lot of pumpkin seeds in this box of packages fresh quality product oz packages made this box a good easy to share with friends family far less expensive than buying these seeds at the grocery store ,fast delivery fresh convenient packaging , great product
the ones i received were mostly in color with some light green instead of dark green dry and somewhat stale they may have been in a warehouse longer that they should have ,disappointed , not as good as it

these pumpkin seeds are the quality i have grown to expect from bob products this is the best price i have been able to find on pumpkin seeds and enjoy them on a daily basis especially in the morning with oatmeal ,pumpkin seeds , great snack
researched a lot on internet before buying these great price great taste happy with my purchase although a bit expensive but a quality product does comes with a price tag ,great taste , great
i have only eaten the raw and they were as expected i will be roasting some up this weekend but i am always happy with bob products a company ,bob red mill pumpkin seeds raw , not as good as
inside the box well packaged and secure seeds br br i cannot say enough about the quality of the packaging a really nice thing for me because it takes some time for me to finish them all and they stay fresh and secure because of the special care taken in the packaging br br the quality of the seeds themselves is very good they are uniform in appearance well shaped appetizing and healty looking br br the price here is totally right for those of us that need more closer to a bulk level of foods these came in a carton br br these are not only items by bob red mills there are many and if grains and nuts and seeds are in your diet your diet or even your pets diet then i cannot recommend this line enough to you for fresh healthy eating br br try them ,good quality and well packaged , not as good as i be
i were pretty enthusiastic to in and try them all but took a step back to read the companies review on each of the vendors and brands we decided that we would begin with the gelato roasted banana true italian artisan gelato after a single bite my girlfriend that it might be the best gelato she has ever had and proceeded to eat most of it while we watched tv the best description she give as she devoured the gelato was saying it was like having velvet wrapping around your body the additional flavors included in our shipment were swirl ice cream and cookie dough classic each of the selections were very delicious and from companies i have never heard of i highly recommend this club to any person looking to give or get an of tasty desserts that you will want to find more of once you are done ,this ice cream rocks , the best in the best
month ice cream of the month club for my wife birthday she received her first shipment today and none of the ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included the ice creams you could have bought several of the ice creams such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip in your local grocery store when i called the number i was told that occasionally they reserve the right to change the ice cream if it does not meet their quality guidelines when i told her none of the four ice creams that we received matched the sheet from the customer service rep was rude and told me that i needed to call back and talk to someone in their support group note you must call before pm est to speak to someone in this group i would seriously caution you to shell out more than for this club ,be of ice cream of the , good product but
i use this in all my recipes calling for brown sugar as per the instructions on the package use one half the amount called for in the recipe if the recipe states one cup of brown sugar you use only one half cup of splenda brown sugar blend i am not a diabetic but i do have many family members who are and this is a great substitute for real brown sugar even though it does contain part splenda and part real brown sugar ,great low calorie sweetner , great product
the only difference i can see between using this blend and using brown sugar is that you do not get the usual sugar rush when you eat the result cookies and pies made with this splenda blend which does contain some sugar taste the exactly the same as they did before great stuff and it is gluten free too ,really good cannot tell the difference , not as good as it is
i love this product now that the are falling us and i am a diabetic it is nice to be able to have treats that i can eat and not feel deprived this is a great brown sugar sub it is the best i have tasted it works like regular sugar so if your on a diet or diabetic like me your have been answered ,easy to use taste is very good , great product
i use this on my oatmeal every morning i cannot tell the difference between this and brown sugar no after taste ,tastes great , great
regular brown sugar by reading these reviews in spite of that i still give it an excellent score br br i ve always used brown sugars of all kinds in my coffee when at the store a few weeks ago i was looking for a lower calorie sweetener for my coffee and happened to buy this splenda brown sugar blend i have been using it in my coffee since and love it the only difference i could tell was it was so much sweeter than my usual coffee that when i got close to the bottom of the cup i would pour more coffee into it to stretch the sweetness now i know why it twice as sweet as regular brown sugar br br just ordered the pack and this should tide me over for a while adding it to teas and coffees delicious it is also cheaper on amazon ,would not be without it , not great
splenda contains real sugar you have to pay attention to the word blend in the title yes diabetics can eat it because it is only half or less the blood sugar agent of the same volume of real sugar it is also why it tastes like real sugar and can be cooked unlike some sugar a lot of non sucrose based sweetners are by heat br br what i have found with this splenda brown sugar is even though it is up so that it is supposed to be equivalent in volume to all sucrose it is really very very sweet so i do not substitute it for sugar i use much less than i would real sugar ,tastes great works as , not as good as it is
it has been mentioned that you only use half the splenda blend than regular brown sugar which is very cool the only problem i have run into is when i need brown sugar for volume making a crust for my crunch half does not work so i end up using regular brown sugar rather than double splenda other than that it works like a charm and you can hardly taste the difference ,very cool , not as good as it is
or molasses sugar you can make your own brown sugar by adding tablespoon molasses to cup cane sugar and mixing it with a fork it comes out nice and fluffy and you can control how much caramel flavor it has and how much extra sugar too br br splenda brown sugar blend as it is is a very granulated splenda a little than splenda white so the texture is better than what you might mix up on your own so for convenience you cannot beat splenda brown sugar blend the splenda brand is superior in my opinion to the store brands that are popping up but and your store might have a really good version br br still and this accounts for a very good four stars you can always count on splenda for texture for flavor and consistency when you bake that counts for a lot in my book ,yummy good substitute for brown sugar , not as good as it is
this taste just like brown sugar with less sugar br i use this for everything that requires sugar baking est i use less of this than is required like if it says use cup i use of splenda brown sugar ,best brown sugar replacement , best tasting ever
greek yogurt mixed with a sliced banana and or sliced strawberries add a teaspoon of splenda brown sugar blend and it is nicely sweetened and a healthy way for me to start my day i started this breakfast routine over a year ago and have not grown tired of it it was suggested at a weight watchers meeting as a very low points breakfast it has easily become my standard for breakfast so much so that i will bring a bag of splenda with me on in case i have trouble finding it at the store i also admit that perhaps i am too up on this routine but it is so satisfying in the morning that i do not care br br i have not personally ever cooked with this brown sugar blend but as a topping on my yogurt or a baked sweet potato it is been great ,of my breakfast , great product
this mix of splenda and sugar works pretty well for me a teaspoon of it is enough for a large cup of coffee and it tastes like a real brown sugar ,sweet , great product
i just love this even on my diet i can have hot yummy it is without that rich brown sugar flavor its just not the same taste love it ,best on hot cereal , best ever
i have been using this to cook with for over a year never had a problem with it love it ,good stuff , great product
love this substitute for brown sugar always stays moist and no one can tell that i am using it instead of regular brown sugar ,tastes like real brown sugar , great product
i have used this in my baking with the regular splenda and it works great always trying to cut calories with out flavor works great in my muffins with just a touch of sugar ,nice for baking , great product
baking for my husband with type diabetes just go easier br i can adapt regular i use only half the amount of sugar called for a bam they turn out great the pack is a great buy too ,the sweet life , great product
this is simply a mix of brown sugar and splenda i am sure it would be cheaper to make your own ,make your own , great product
if you are looking to cut out some cal and want a great taste then go with this i keep getting it sent to me every months love it ,great , not as good as it
i purchased this item to bake some low carb cookies for a diabetic friend this works well for that however i did find that there is another brown sugar alternative that is calorie free both options worked well in the cookies ,a good alternative , good
have not been able to determine how and if is to those who prefer not to partake in using sugar i mostly use that has everything but needed to use some kind of sugar so i bought this perhaps it deserves a higher rating and also there is the chance it might deserve stars instead of still it is a better option than most items out there in the free world so that is why i stars hope this helps and wish all who read this the most wonderful and holidays starting with thanksgiving all the way to the new year stars for splenda brown sugar blend ounce packages pack of which by the way it ended being in quantity much more than i had for but what can you do unless in the future amazon would allow to split orders such as this with other amazon customers imagine that ,for what it is , not as good as it is
i made the mistake of thinking that this product was simply brown sugar flavored splenda i did not read the product details stating that it actually has brown sugar in it my mistake ,this product has sugar in it , not as good as it is
who ever is making french potato sticks keep it up they are the best french should have keep them in their line mike ,potato sticks , delicious
oh my these are going on my list to re order they are actually like them a lot better than the oreos with cream in the middle crispy crunchy low cal cookie if you can eat only bag that is packs a powerful chocolate punch for a low cal snack satisfies my chocolate craving without the guilt actually choose these over the thins any day more flavorful satisfying have to stop myself from open a nd pkg ,you to eat just bag , good but not great
my month old son has been a fan of yummy spoonfuls from his first bite the garden flavor is a new favorite the puree is thick and almost creamy perfect for a baby who likes his food to have texture he is always happy when i bring a cup of this to his tray ,yum , great product
these are not black winter truffles i thought the price was too good to be true even though they are not fresh and it is these are it says so right on the label br br i was very angry about this but jr mushrooms has said they will refund me for the truffles and even let me keep them so i give jr credit for excellent and customer service although i still feel they should not be labeled black winter truffles ,beware these are not , not as good as it is
if every seller was like jr mushrooms the world would be a much better place they wont stop until there customer is satisfied i ordered some winter black truffles from them and got my package lightning fast but came to find out that it what i ordered i called jr and they said they sent better quality black truffles that cost more for the same price and this story doesnt end they even sent a jar of the original truffles i ordered just so i can taste the for free name another seller that would do that ,is the , not as good as it is
finally a company that cares about it is reputation and products i ordered these truffles and recieved them securely packaged and protected to ensure they arrived safely and as quickly as possible i am even planning a special dinner with friends entirely based around the truffles i ordered as i was so please with them br br i also saw the other products this company carries the attention to detail and the information provided on each and every product is outstanding just like their quality i e i have found my gourmet source from now on ,amazing company , great product
true story i online looking for difficult and expensive to find gourmet ingredients when i came across this listing every review raved about the excellent service provided by jr mushrooms i them to ask a question about refrigeration vs shelf storage and got a voice mail i left a message and five minutes later the man himself personally called and gave me friendly and professional answers to my questions i ordered these truffles and several other items the next morning there was a little personal e mail from jr me for the order and by the order had arrived although i chose the cheapest shipping this is the best customer service i have ever experienced with on line shopping thanks ,and is the of gourmet food , great product
first package was lost in the mail but jr shipped a at no charge with hour shipment ,customer service by j r , not as good as
not only are the truffles excellent but the package arrived in record speed with standard shipping chosen we are very pleased with our truffles and with our experience with this company we will be ordering from them again ,excellent , great product
i though this product lack flavor as i taste different brands far better br there were no real flavor as i expected sorry ,black , great taste
had no taste and after the heat of the dish it was on turned them to a better off buying the high price truffles ,no taste , not as good as it
we tried these and they were bland and had no redeeming qualities we sauteed them slightly and also tried them as is the price as some have mentioned what you get for truffles spend your money on white truffle oil you will be much happier we are also wait for the white truffles to come in from italy i would not knock jr as a company but would not recommend this offering ,not the you want , good but not great
there was absolutly no scent or flavor to this when i brought home truffles from in italy they were wonderful and cost less these were worthless ,what , good
i ordered this in the past and was extremely disappointed they are unlike truffles that i know of they were hard like a huge seed had no truffle aroma i threw all contents out will never order them again ,disappointment , not as good as
this is not what one should expect from a black truffle but we are not paying the price for a winter truffle it is cheap but there is a reason for that there is no taste and no smell at all i was disappointed when i tried this truffle but i realized that the price was that for a reason at least it can be used to add a to your dish ,no taste no smell , not as good as it is
i should have listened to the negative reviews but hoped that the positive reviews would ring more true there was little truffle flavor that got entirely lost in the risotto i made i agree with the other reviewers in that this was and flavorless not worth even this price for truffles ,big disappointment , not as good as it is
oil the oil will add the flavor the preserved truffles the truffle look but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish or in to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget does not allow for the real thing br note preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost no flavor or odor if you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle if you are looking to add a truffle look only to your dish then this is the product for you br br better to buy real truffle oil experiment for example jr mushrooms on amazon is a good start about dollars is low that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil ,looking to add a look only to your no flavor then this is it , good product
zero stars for this item i could not even confirm that the wrinkled little animal sort of thing is a truffle this lacks any aromatic attraction at all i would be afraid to put it in anything i planned to eat for fear it would ruin the entire item br br as for the famous jr service my complaints about this product have been ,no stars for this expensive , not as good as it is
i am the biggest fan of mushrooms you will ever meet but these are really disgusting they taste like dirt i have to imagine better quality truffles if these are even truffles at all are better they would have to be there would be no comparison these are really bad ,horrible , good but not great
i gave this item as a gift and the recipient has not yet made the dish for which i gave it to her a dish but i must say this price for a french truffle is amazing i suspect most of us do not have the to appreciate the truffles good for those of you who do but for the rest of us this is a good choice br linda ,french at , not as good as it is
this review is mostly about the seller they are great the product arrived within days with standard shipping br br i have never had black truffles before they have a very earthy smoky flavor that really when lightly sauteed in butter they are an expensive pleasant treat ,great service interesting product , great taste
this is our second time using your black winter truffles they are truly delicious we throw them in with pasta and truffle oil to have the world best dish reminds of our stay in tuscany this is a quality product and we plan on buying again in the near future ,delicious , great taste
recieved the truffles in one day shipping the customer service is over the top i opened the jar and enjoyed the aroma i will shop with them again ,customer , not as good as it is
these truffles are not as great as they are made up to be i thought for the price they would have a greater taste but they did not have much taste at all they are not worth the price but had to find out for myself i will not be buying truffles again and i am not going to spend over for a fresh one ,nothing special , not as good as it is
teas but they had stevia added to them and i could not get past the taste of that this tea is not bitter and has a very nice smooth flavor i have had it both hot and cold i do feel that i am energized after drinking it but it is not a jittery feeling it is more of an awake and alert feeling and refreshed energized physical feeling some reviewers state it has a sweet taste to it but i do not get that while i do not often add my packet of sugar in the raw to it perhaps that is what they mean that you do not have to add sugar to it i have replaced my second cup of coffee in the morning with this tea and i even have another cup throughout the day instead of coffee excellent taste and an all around great product ,no great flavor and it does work , great flavor
as a long time yerba mate and coffee drinker runa traditional guayusa has switched me over the super smooth and sweet flavor to this tea gives it the same of any other based drink but with the lasting power and complexity as any high end tea br br drink up ,this is , great taste
i was introduced to runa guayusa about months ago and i have been drinking it pretty consistently since then it is a great alternative to coffee which tends to make me nervous the taste is mild and almost a little sweet also it does not get bitter like green tea or yerba mate when steeped for too long br br also runa business model makes me feel good about drinking this tea they are a certified b and they do great work with the farmers in the amazon br br i highly recommend you try it ,love this tea , great tea
i usually do not drink tea because it does not have the caffeine kick i am looking for but guayusa tea has almost as much caffeine as a cup of coffee and unlike coffee it does not need to be in cream and sugar to taste good and does not have any of the other unpleasant side effects i usually add about half a spoonful of sugar per cup which is enough to pleasantly complement the natural flavor now if only starbucks would start carrying guayusa ,i drink this instead of coffee , not as good as i be
as a tea runa traditional guayusa offers a simple taste that is not like any other tea i have had i used to swear by matcha green tea but runa is a superior alternative in that it is super cheap more much easier to swallow and offers just as many health benefits br br also if you look into it runa doing some great things on the side of social and rainforest i highly suggest reading into it it will make you love the product even more ,me , great tea
life thirsty or not hot or cold this tea can help you in many ways as a college student to be an i cannot just take prescribed drugs all the time to keep my attention span up instead i turn to caffeine all day every day runa tea has been one of the few products that have really caused me to feel refreshed as if i was just hydrated after a run as well as feeling as if i were ready to write a page paper from scratch i do not know what it is but it just makes you feel good in every way personally i love the cold tea but as a consumer everyone needs to find their niche as i am a huge hot tea drinker and chose the cold version either way same thing you need to try it and then try and our star opinions ,do not it try it , great product
clean taste and clean energy br br packaging is attractive simple and elegant as well br br sourcing and organic round out the whole package br br overall nice product ,amazing tea flavor energy , great product
as much of a tea fanatic as i consider myself i would never heard of before running into the runa brand now that i have i could see myself buying it over and over again it has a full bodied flavor without the bitter aftertaste of some black teas it is earthy without being heavy handed or overpowering completely unique from any other tea i have tasted you will not find tea like this anywhere else and though the product for itself the business model of this brand does not hurt runa buys guayusa directly from local farmers in ecuador at fair trade prices try it it is worth every cent ,taste good do good , good tea but not a great price
i watched a youtube video on guayusa tea and heard very good things about it there and on the amazon reviews as so i thought i would give it a try money well spent this tea is smooth and easy to drink and is absolutely delicious with sugar and honey br another awesome thing about this tea is the dreams you get my mother has not had a dream in years and i offered this tea to her one day and that night she had three dreams she was so thrilled she bought two more boxes of the runa guayusa tea i am so satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend to anyone who needs some steady energy and dreams ,i am not a tea and yet i love this tea , not as good as i have
little hint of sweetness and a nice gentle flavor very easy drinking and it does give a kick of caffeine energy i have been a diet pepsi diet coke drinker for years because i like their tastes and the caffeine never could do coffee and tea is too bitter but i have recently converted to being a for work and needed to the heavy soda drinks this guayusa is perfect as tea bags it is obviously lighter than around sodas and it has more caffeine too better for me too and no bitterness like tea or coffee and i am supporting fair trade small farmers in ecuador instead of giant soda companies the packaging is recycled post consumer br br this guayusa is as good as advertised i like drinking it and i cannot think of any stars i am glad i found this product it is worth the price ,as good as advertised , great product
talk about a versatile new product drink it hot on a winter morning drink it iced on a summer afternoon mix it with your favorite add it to a marinade combine it with your your best herbs i love it all it is smooth and almost silky texture and lack of tannins make it great for anything how has it taken so long to make it to the states ,so many , best ever
love the snack wanted to buy a bunch p shipping at amazon is more than the price of the snack try ordering a dozen and then look at the shipping price p every link i have tried to this snack takes you back to amazon shipping rates p another reason to buy your books at com too back they do not carry food as well ,amazon , great snack
this is the worst flavored coffee i have ever tried there is no aroma or flavor of chocolate raspberry to this coffee bean at all in fact the coffee tastes sour i too am sorry i could not buy just lb to try it first now i am stuck with this awful coffee i cannot return so buyer beware no returns ,chocolate flavored coffee , not as good as it is
i like some of coffee bean direct coffees but i cannot stand the taste of this one and no one else in the house likes it either i wish i could of bought it in a smaller package rather than the lb bag that cost over i do not recommend this product to anyone but everybody has their own taste and some people may like it ,never will purchase again , not as good as i be
wow this chocolate raspberry flavored coffee is the absolute best we have ever had and i can honestly say we have tried quite a few in our time and of course the price cannot be beat unless you find someone who wants to sell you some that fell off the back of some delivery truck ,chocolate , great coffee
i was surprised how much raspberry flavor the coffee has the coffee has a nice aroma and a chocolate flavor i will get this flavor again ,chocolate flavor , good coffee
we really enjoy this coffee we recommend to store it in an airtight container after opening to maintain it is full flavor we enjoy it as an evening coffee ,great flavor , great coffee
this coffee is my favorite i usually do not like the taste of coffee and cannot tell the difference between brands but this stuff tastes different and good my only complaint is that amazon raised the price recently from to i still bought it again at the higher price but if it goes any higher i probably won t ,good stuff , great coffee
nice small nutritious biscuit nice pocket size resealable pouch is a plus as well will order more in the future ,dog treat , great product
my jack and both love the lamb what we refer to as doggie cookie bones br they re finally the need to go out onto our five to relieve themselves br with help of the pro plan biscuits with real lamb as a reward we use the small ones as jack br tends to and weighs less than lbs this one item added to their daily menu has br made a huge difference in our household reducing the mama not happy time to about ,amazon makes happy again , great product
i am so happy to have found a wonderful decaf tea for myself and guests this tea is nice and full flavored and has a very smooth finish i usually use the k cup twice on setting and the tea remains true and delicious the price is the best i have found anywhere ,good tea , great tea
twinings english breakfast decaffeinated tea was exactly what i was looking for i loved the english breakfast tea but needed to find a decaf version the taste is great the price is right and i am sold ,excellent taste , great tea
great tasting tea in fact much better then the bags of same i am an decaf irish breakfast tea drinker but cannot find that in k cups english breakfast in k cups tastes great ,yum without the , great tea
i have been drinking tea for years it used to be made in england but now they have a plant in north carolina for the american trade the tea is excellent i drink the decaf for health reasons and find that it is as tasty as the regular tea ,a good cup of tea , great tea
this is a pretty good cup of tea i just wish pg tips made pods for the keurig brewer maybe eventually ,good tea , great tea
i just purchased a and this was one of the first k cups i bought i still use it but if it was decaf would be better than id rate it five starts ,good , not good
please do not tell me this is going to be a seasonal find only i made the pink lemonade cake with the pink lemonade frosting for july th and it was such a big hit the blend of lemon sweet and pink are just right when i went back to get more mixes they had been to the seasonal section and i could only find cake mixes and no more frosting it is definitely a year round keeper i am thinking granddaughter birthday parties parties parties ,fantastic , good but not great
i made the pink lemonade cake mix and used this frosting to it for mother day and it was a huge success my mother who does not normally like cake really enjoyed this i thought it had just the right blend of tangy and sweet i hope this flavor sticks around because it was really good ,yum , not as good as it is
pink lemonade is one of my all time favorite drinks so when i saw had this beautifully pink pink lemonade frosting i had to get it i paired it with their pink lemonade cake mix br br i think i died and went to pink lemonade heaven actual lemon flavoring gives this just a hint of tartness while the sweetness drives you mad the gorgeous pink color says easter and spring br br perfect for dessert for the family or the ladies tea br br i highly recommend this yummy frosting try it with the cake mix too ,and for summer , great product
this is my favorite of all the choices of coffee for the new vue i do not like strong tasting coffee i prefer dunkin donuts over starbucks until they come out with a dunkin donuts vue pack this light roast is perfect for me ,my , great coffee
this is an awful coffee the flavor is extremely weak and tastes more like a lemon grass tea than coffee ,tastes like tea , great taste
i have recently purchased the vue by and i must say my initial are very positive the new design provides a better cup of coffee having used green mountain nantucket breakfast blend before i was presented with a very good cup of coffee it is actually stronger and better flavored than the original the brewing system must contribute to the difference if you like medium roast coffee as your morning wake me up than you should give this a try assuming you are going to use it in the new vue machine ,good medium roast , good coffee
i was very happy with the way this turned out it is very similar to traditional american beers but with an extra kick the flavor is very smooth has a creamy head and ends with a slight this is a great beer to start with for new brewers and alike if you are to anxious to wait for it to age you can drink it after weeks it will taste good but get better with age make sure to put it in the fridge after it lager ages and taste best when in colder conditions ,very good , not as good as it is
i brewed this kit first as it was the one that came with the kit i followed the instructions exactly note if you do not follow the instructions exactly you are opening up opportunity for problems i brewed for about days i then bottled and let condition for weeks at room temperature i then put the beer in the fridge i tried two bottles the next day the taste was ok but it was very flat i then put more bottles in the fridge and let them sit for weeks i tried one of these after the two weeks and it was great the carbonation was perfect and the taste improved even more definitely give the beer time to condition you will be glad you did ,great brew will try again , not as good as i be
makes a nice lager that is quite a bit heavier than the domestic lager beers i do not plan on making any more but has more to do with my love of dark than the quality flavor of this kit ,nice , good
i have been brewing this beer off and on for the past five years along with many others when it comes time to pour a glass it has never let me down even without using methods it always into a a tasty drink ,just good beer , great taste
i got my husband a brew kit from for his birthday the lager is the only beer he is tried to brew but he says it is very easy and it tastes good it tastes best if you only let it in the bottles for a week we are definitely going to try other flavors ,easy to brew husband loves it , not as good as it is
this is a good brew for the time and expense involved that being said the longer you and bottle condition the better it will be i thought i had drank all of my batch when i discovered two additional bottles away they were the best and they had sat for a good three months give it time if you follow the included directions you will get closer to six gallons vs the five in the amazon description additionally the included directions state to use sugar obviously will work better but you can still use plain old old sugar i ve used brown sugar and avoided any cider like finish if you order the full kit it comes with carbonation drops and a dextrose save yourself the money get this kit use sugar and bottle condition forever ,good brew but , not as good as it is
i love using the os lager can as a base for making various pale since it has only i can add different to it to make light to dark amber it is easy to get consistent results with especially when re hydrating the yeast in c warm water to which tsp of dextrose has been added br it a good product for experimenting for the experienced home brewer alike ,as base , great product

i bought some of this creates an awesome effect on cakes and candies love it completely edible br br but overpriced on amazon usually amazon is cheaper than buying in stores but these are only at any store so is severely overpriced ,great stuff too expensive on amazon , great product
br i tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to paint it on i had read this was the best way to do it i found that the was very and not very consistent maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively in the end because the red color was important for the cake i mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color not a great deal br br in the end i would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red but as was i did not find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again i hope that other people have a better experience as i very much like the idea of the product ,was not red , good but not as good as it is
my daughter loves this stuff on cake pops it add just a little color if on dry but the color is more vibrant if mixed with extract and on ,great a little , great product

it is period but ground as only masa is to make a good corn tortilla it has great flavor tortillas can be a real pain in the to make too many people worry about how it doesnt look like a commercial tortilla but i will bet you that as it is it will leave in the dust the hardest part is getting the mix right after that all you need is a rolling pin and two pieces of wax paper make a few and you will get the hang br br you really do not need a tortilla press what you really need is practice ,it is , great product
corn flour is not treated with lime corn flour with lime gives it a fairly distinct bitter aftertaste and a more dense construction chocolate chip cookies made with masa which tastes like the tortillas it is meant for little bitter with chocolate chips br br i wish it were corn flour as of this writing none of the major mills in the that means north and south make gluten free corn flour not even bob red mill is anymore them for having the integrity to say so although i hear you can order it from in canada br br this is where we cut to the texas face br br this is masa sorry guys ,it is not corn flour it is is with lime gluten free though , not as good as i be

and comfort sort of a nutty caramel with vanilla notes it is the perfect dessert tea my husband lost lbs by drinking this instead of having ice cream now when you present it to friends let them taste it first if they go by the intense aroma in the bag it is so fresh some have wrongly thought it was too strong a flavor but it is not it is the amazing freshness they are not used to we served this at our wedding and it beat out vanilla and paris too this tea has filled a i have had in my collection i have searched for a flavor like this over years br lana please keep on creating this tea i am definitely coming back for more br and thank you for tremendous and fast service btw i am sipping this as i write yum br smiles grace in ,fantastic , i love it
the written description of this tea was good enough to get me to put it on my wish list this xmas my wife prefers the sweeter teas such as of tea kiwi pear and i generally go for traditional prince of etc but this tea is perfect for both of us i always liked good vanilla teas and some coconut teas always blew me away as well our at steep tea still make some of the best teas in around so we were pretty game to try this lana tea it always feels good to try out teas by the small guys br br anyway there was this unbelievably great aroma to this tea that we could not pin down until one of our pointed out this smells like need i go on ,a tea both my wife and i agree is heavenly , great tea
i completely agree w grace comments this the perfect dessert tea i have given up sugar but love coconut and this is the perfect replacement the smell in the bag is intoxicating but it to a soft vanilla almond coconut smooth sweetness when brewed i have many excellent teas in my collection but this beats many of them especially if you are craving something sweet thank you lana please keep making and quickly shipping this fantastic tea ,tea lover , great tea

this tea is my favorite i have never had any tea that could match it please consider making it in a decaf version so i can curl up and enjoy it in the evening also ,absolutely wonderful , great tea
this tea is very similar to coconut almond i have bought at whole foods unfortunately i do not live near a whole foods this loose leaf tea is awesome i was first put off by what i considered to be higher than normal shipping charges but the cost of the tea is so cheap when compared to buying it in tea bag form i will probably get cups of tea out of this package the flavor is so unique i cannot wait to try it this summer in a sun tea jar ,unique addictive , not as good as i like
recieved the tea very quickly with very helpful detailed brewing instructions tea is absolutely delicious like dessert in a cup ,delicious , great tea
tea sounded so interesting and the five star reviews made it simply irresistible i had to try it the delivery was very fast and it was nicely packaged when my husband saw we had new tea he had to open it the next thing i heard wow you have got to smell this the aroma is so wonderful the sweet scent from the coconut and almond fills the air and the hints of vanilla are simply divine while the fresh aroma is intense the smooth taste is beyond compare a great substitute to after dinner desserts its calming essence makes it great for a quiet evening at home be prepared to indulge your senses br br snowflake tea now has to be our favorite tea i plan to buy it as stocking stuffers for my friends and family lana keep creating this tea i plan to buy a lot more ,tea in a cup , nice for the

although orange is stocked everywhere their hard to find ginger preserve is truly incredible i have tried many other brands but this one is truly classic with the intense ginger flavor i love try it on a warm english muffin crunchy fresh waffles or as a roast chicken glaze ,favorite , great
this preserve is really delicious aromatic and not too sweet nor too and it is cut in just the right size pieces for spreading not too or too br br i ve wasted so money on so many different preserves i eat a few teaspoon usually find them too sweet then they sit in the until i finally throw them away this brand i ate all of in just about months which is really fast for me it stayed in edible condition in the fridge up to the last spoonful br br amazon is listing four bottles each containing pound of preserve so each bottle costs about plus shipping ,first jar of that i ate all of , great taste
found these locally in chicago about months ago amazon price is high but these are definitely the best i have ever tried my wife and i cook with it and just spread it on toast or crackers the white jar is also distinctive ,best ginger ever , best ever
for those who enjoy ginger the preserves taste great on crackers and bread the texture allows for easy spreading but it is not runny it also stays fresh if stored in the refrigerator ,great ginger , great product
on an english muffin the day starts off best with the mild taste of ginger ,ginger day , great product
always used the ginger this production is almost as good but the price is inflated for the size of the jar the product was packed well glass jars and arrived promptly ,good product overpriced , great product
my nearby fresh and easy market an english company has a variety of english fruit spreads and i am enjoying trying them out one of the latest is son ginger preserve oh my this stuff is just delicious i have always liked ginger but as a spread it is just fantastic what a nice flavor for my breakfast toast i can hardly wait to try this out on other folks or i could give a jar here and there as gifts i am sure they would be appreciated br br gary peterson ,oh my this stuff is delicious , delicious
this spread is just right but costs only about six dollars locally br price with shipping here is ridiculous ,great but expensive here , best ever
second time i have reported this one jar broken and order br not what pictured jam same but jar different i know my ginger br br this not same ,broken and not what picture , not as good as it is
you can order the same products online from nespresso for approx and you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items some of which you may not like br br nespresso makes great coffee and great machines the nespresso capsule offers posted on amazon however are all by third parties who prey on people who do not know better ,is out of line the price of buying them from , not as good as it is
great coffees i enjoyed the most when friends come over for coffee it gives lot of fun to try out all the ,variety , great coffee
i picked this off the shelf without any research and my husband who is pretty particular about his vodka and tequila and rum but that is another story loved this i am not a vodka drinker but even i had to admit the first smell and taste were extremely pleasant and he said it tasted wonderful straight and excellent in mixed drink made by two guys from using a copper still definitely worth the price ,great aroma no after , not as good as it is
our year old son was diagnosed with being allergic to soy and peanuts this is the only sunflower butter that we have found that is free of both allergens and not processed on shared equipment this is the only product we buy now our son likes it on pb j crackers on celery and by the spoonful and with no sugars added much more healthy for him ,only sunflower butter we will buy , great product
this stuff is pure natural creamy goodness perfect for using in recipes and for eating straight out of the tub ,delicious , delicious
since sun butter only contains roasted sunflower seeds and no other ingredients it is the only nut butter product we buy ,best tasting butter around , best ever
this is a sun butter with absolutely fresh roasted sunflower seed taste i was pleasantly surprised from the first taste shipping is very reasonable also i trust but still i was by how good this tastes ,best butter ever by far , delicious
i originally ordered this product as an allergy free alternative to peanut butter i have many serious food allergies peanut walnut almond dairy gluten corn soy and another popular brand of sunflower seed butter is manufactured on equipment that also processes soy not just in a shared facility but on shared equipment i am thrilled to say that this sunflower butter is not only smooth and creamy with a delicious taste but it is organic has no added salt or sugar and is free of other allergens give it a try i bet you will love it ,pure organic sunflower butter no soy here , not as good as i be
when a peanut butter addict like me says this is better it is saying a lot br flavor very creamy texture almost to creamy more like a puree br not to oily or sweet just right does not stick to the roof of your mouth br organic makes it even better and healthier ,better than peanut butter , not as good as it is
no sugar or anything added to the product i have to add honey to it when i eat it and it tastes fine with honey br quality seems fine to me it seems a bit oily compared to peanut butter but it never gets hard like peanut butter does even keeping it in the fridge ,good plain natural sunflower butter , not as good as it is
although sun butter tastes like sunflower seeds and nothing like peanut butter it still tastes great and has a smooth creamy texture the only drawback i noticed was that it is a little runny compared to peanut butter ,great substitute for peanut butter , the best licorice
tastes burnt roasted slightly rotten sunflower seed taste gritty bland no salt sugar only seeds would not eat if it was free ,weird stuff , the best
just received this butter yesterday and we are already using it to make sandwiches with jelly tastes great without having any salt or sugar added highly recommend ,tastes great , delicious
this organic sunflower butter is the only one i can find with the least additives my only alternative is to make my own and this saves time ,best thing to making your own , great product
i ordered this product because i wanted alternative to peanut butter and it is organic i actually prefer the creamy sunflower taste over peanut butter now definitely would buy again ,delicious , delicious
this stuff is great i am allergic to peanuts just happened over night and i miss having a so this is the next best thing to it truly this butter is all that and then some ,tastes like peanut butter , great product
pure and organic no salt no sugar no poison what more can you ask for i keep mine in the fridge and it stays soft and easily i use it in my banana cacao smoothies and it tastes good warning not as good as peanut butter for this recipe but it is better for you so i can accept the difference in taste i admit and is a better combo and change is never easy but what is your health worth to you this is all im buying from now on ,simply awesome , not as good as it is
per the manufacturer the product is organic and only made from sunflower seeds it tastes very natural and fresh i would highly recommend if you like the natural taste of sunflower seeds ,very good organic , not as good as
i put teabags of easy now in an entire let it steep for min and have some before bed no matter when i got to sleep i always wake up hours later feeling good and without having up in the middle of the night except maybe to use the but i always fall back asleep instantly its also great anytime during the day to just calm your nerves it will not make you sleepy this is easily my favorite calming tea ,easy now tea is great , great product
these are perfect for portion control i like the stand up bag too great for putting the candy in the fridge as opposed to the flat bags my husband and i are both trying to lost weight and to be able to grab one of these calorie chocolate packs from m m are great br i was also very pleased with how they were shipped you have to pay a little for packs but that is fine and then it came in a styrofoam box to keep the chocolate from melting br i ll definitely order these from amazon again ,perfect size , great taste
that many more changes of something getting squished or ruined i have always wondered when they are cheaper than in regular stores or if the quality is a little lower br br in this case i handed out a lot of the candies and while everything was eaten there were some major problems with both of my bags of peanut m almost all of them were crushed and there were peanuts with a little bit of m m stuck to them and then a lot of m m dust the snickers were not squished and the sticks were all intact so not sure what happened br br that being said these deals that amazon are fantastic and they pack them very well definitely worth it if you need to buy it in bulk just with all bagged candies be forewarned that all the pieces may not come in totally intact ,nice mix damaged peanut m , not as good as i be
when i ordered these bags it was only today it is so i paid for a little more than pounds bag with free s h via amazon prime membership br br it had more plain m m than any other candy but that could have just been my bags you may find differently all the bags were sealed and none of the candy was broken or crushed it is fresh and the expire or best if used by date is july so long shelf life i also sent a couple of bags to my senior parents who love chocolate br br if you found this helpful please click on the yes box ,great if the price is right , great taste
i really like the fruity taste of this tea so much so that i can actually drink it without sugar if you like fruity teas you should try this product ,great fruity taste , not as good as it is
when i read the other review of this tea i had to write this tea has a wonderful balanced flavor that mixes the tartness of raspberry and the sweetness of peach to come up with a smooth blend i usually want a little honey in my tea but this one does not really need it makes a great iced tea too ,this is my favorite tea , great tea
i am a fan of the drink white peach puree and a italian sparkling wine and i was not disappointed i mainly brew it for ice tea i disagree with some of reviewers in that not only do you taste the raspberries and peaches you can also taste the sparking wine this is my primary drink in the summer to give it a little kick i will sometimes add a peach liquor or peach flavored rum i recommend it highly ,it is great , not as good as it is
i almost never write reviews but i thought i would for this one i am pretty open to tastes of anything but something about the smell and taste of this product was really bad it tasted off almost i am really disappointed because i had hoped to like it and i love fruity green teas but this was no good i would strongly recommend trying a sample of this if possible before buying sorry maybe i will like another flavor i have not given up on you yet ,could not the taste or smell , not as good as it is
this tea has mostly all raspberry flavours with little to no peach at all i added a peach green tea bag when i brew it a little sweetener it is very tough to taste the sparkling wine flavour either at best it is a nice raspberry green tea but it is certainly not what i was expecting hoping for if i bought it from a store i would have taken it back ,not very , not as good as i like
my husband and i absolutely love this gum that is actually good for you it keeps flavor for a long time ,awesome , great taste
a bit pricy but well worth it to avoid the garbage found in other gums made in usa and delicious ,great gum will buy more , not as good as
i love b fresh cinnamon gum it tastes great it is good for you and it temporarily your breath now the flavor does not last a long time but with pieces you have plenty to chew on ,delicious , great taste
i love this gum but i gave it stars because the flavor does not last long you will enjoy it though ,good gum , great taste
great for when you are pregnant or nursing no artificial anything including no aspartame yay the bubble gum is the best gum in the whole world love this gum ,the bubble gum is better but b fresh rocks , great taste
greenies arrived promptly are fresh with an expire date months from now great price to keep my dogs favorite treat on hand for many months to come yes she through them quickly but she loves them so much i dont care this is the best price i have ever seen on greenies so we stocked up ,my dog is so happy , great product
my border expect one of these each night before bed i have learned how important it is to create regular to keep these active dogs calm and there is no way i have time to brush their teeth each even if they would let me but this can get very expensive when i found them here at this price i ordered tons then went back and ordered more figuring the price would increase to that on other sites it had increased a bit but still a great price entirely pets delivered a bit late due to supply problems but that was okay since i had just received enough to last a month ,great price on a great product , my dog loves it
the photo shows potato and carrot pieces in the butternut squash base but upon opening a can there are no potato or carrot pieces to be found unlike the cans i have bought from a local grocery store i guess this must be a change in wolfgang puck recipe but the photo on the can does not the contents anymore several cans out of the twelve pack were delivered dented although none seriously packing with better filling could have dents in transit ,good soup too many , good but not great
i have been buying these at the grocery store every week for a year my husband and i eat wp soups every day for lunch i am so happy amazon can deliver to my doorstep ,healthy and delicious , great taste
i had ordered a case of this incredible soup based on my experience of ordering it at the the dallas fort worth resturant it was so incredible that i ordered another container to go couldnt stop thinking about it during my meeting in dallas and ordered two more before my flight back to california i went out of my way to go to this so i could order it again br br so when i got the canned version not as impressed oh well ,its not as great as the version but its still good , not as good as it is
this soup is advertised as creamy however when it arrived it was signature puck changed the recipe of the creamy butternut squash soup and is now calling it signature butternut squash soup it does not taste the same and is not as good as the original recipe ,not creamy but , not as good as
months ago i had my first butternut squash soup hand made at a fancy restaurant i do not like canned soups but i saw this in our local grocers and remembering the soup i had at the restaurant i decided to try it it was delicious it is my favorite lunch go to now i have added shredded roasted turkey to make it but as for taste it is wonderful i order the case on amazon which is cheaper than my local store i also tried their french onion soup which is really good i have avoided the others simply because in their best form i do not like chicken noodles and tomato soups but for the i do like and have tried they really made something from canned soups and i would recommend them ,delicious , great product
very good soup light and creamy added curry gives just right spice to the taste love it highly recommend to try it you will not put your spoon down until you ate it all ,best soup ever , great taste
the soup is rich and tasty but do not buy it from amazon the packaging is so poor that the cans dented as did the replacement shipment i got my money back but now have to pay more to buy this wonderful soup from my local grocer ,wonderful soup but , not as good as it is
i have eaten in various restaurants operated by wolfgang puck and have always found the food to be delicious this soup is no exception the only problem is that it is high in sodium fat cholesterol and calories in general per servings are calories total fat g saturated fat g cholesterol mg sodium mg this sodium total is of what you should get for the whole day by comparison campbell chicken with rice soup has calories total fat g saturated fat g cholesterol mg sodium mg almost double the sodium salt but much healthier in every other category the bottom line is if you want healthy soup make it yourself ,tastes good but not real healthy , not as good as you are
this is quite simply the best mac n cheese on the market it is our go to meal for when we have not gone to the grocery store and need a dinner br br my tips br add the optional butter you know you want to br personally i find that it needs just the smallest pinch of salt to bring out its flavors br some fresh ground pepper rounds it out br br if you like this stuff i also highly recommend the annie snack mix i think also available on amazon i believe annie makes both products with their bunny tm the dangerous addiction i have developed is totally worth it ,highly addictive , not as good as i be
this mac cheese is really creamy without tasting processed and it has the right amount of salt very good product overall ,yummy , great taste
i have always been a fan of annie products and since i am overseas at the moment i didn have access to the products that is where amazon comes in the price is very good almost the same as buying them in the store in the states and the product came in great shape and the expiration date is not soon either br as for the product itself i think the sauce can use less salt but other wise i love it natural ingredients and it takes less than minutes for me to make it ,great price , great product
i am a big fan of anything annie so it is no surprise i give these stars there is simply no comparison between the and the truly mac cheese which is annie i enjoy the white cheddar the most ,love , good
this is twice as expensive as basic box mac and cheese it is just so so in taste if you check the ingredients it is not much different than other mac and cheese the cost does not justify the ordering i will not be ordering from amazon again the cost is much cheaper at a big box chain ,so so , not as good as it is
annie has a great line of food and this macaroni and cheese is great kids like it grown ups like it ,great cheese , great product
our family really enjoys this shells and cheese i love the convenience of mac and cheese but usually the flavor is horrible annie tastes great and is better for you cannot beat that ,great quality , great taste
to all those who complain of the taste you making it right br br i know because sometimes i put in a little too much milk or whatever but when you make this stuff right it really its also good to know that im not eating as many chemicals as other kinds of mac and cheese br br i find the family size serving better personally ,this is the best and cheese , not as good as it is
it is all natural no artificial color no weird ingredients but it also has no taste the sauce is thin and runny and does not have much flavor if you need a boxed dinner in a pinch then by all means use a product with natural ingredients but if you want good mac and cheese stick with homemade ,all natural but bland , not as good as it is
very yummy my kids and i loved it cute story on the box too ,yummy , great
no long lists of chemical additives either nice to find something quick and easy that i do not have to feel guilty giving my kids from time to time i have no problem paying a little bit of a premium for annie it is well worth it br br oh and for anyone who is getting lumps take the package directions at face value and mix the cheese separately then add the pasta ,no more orange cheese , good for you
my whole family really enjoys annie mac cheese the reason i gave it stars was due to the high salt content common to all boxed dinners ,great natural alternative , great taste
all annie products are excellent beats the other name brands br br for flavor it is organic with no additives good item to keep on hand for a quick lunch ,creamy and delicious , great coffee
i have been disappointed with this product we have always enjoyed annie products have never had a problem until now the cheese was so clumped that i was unable to make a sauce without lumps i have used different packages from my order have had the problem with all of them i am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse either way beware ,it may be good if i could get the out , not as good as it is
i love annie but this had no taste very bland and unappealing i would not purchase this again but worst of all i am stuck with boxes ,organic is great but , great taste
i bought this and a grinder and a couple other varieties of course salts as a gift for my at christmas i know he enjoys the visual appeal of the coarse ground salt and i was tired of buying the use and toss of salt at the grocery store br br as far as this salt goes you should not use it in a grinder because it is too moist i did not know this until after i had purchased it i still use it as a finishing salt but for the use i had in mind grinding on food it does not work ,good quality not getting flavor difference , not as good as it is
this has to be the best and easiest bread machine mix i have come across incredibly simple directions and impossible to fail plus the come out perfect everytime i ve had issues in the past with getting whole wheat flours to rise as well as white flours i have purchased this collection several times and will continue to do so ,best and bread ever , great product
i originally got this bread thru amazon but now buy it directly from the manufacturer so i can get free shipping when buying worth that a lot of bread mixes it is truly delicious easy to make in my bread machine and there are a lot of different flavors the yeast does come in separate little packs in both the individual and the multi packs br it a little more expensive than the hodgson mill bread also very good available thru amazon but a much greater variety ,wonderful bread , great product
i could not be more pleased with the bread machine mixes they are delicious the service was outstanding ,great product great service , great product
i bought a new bread machine and bought this collection of bread mixes as well as some single mixes to try it out the single mixes worked well as they included yeast packaged separately in the mix my machine states clearly not to get the yeast wet to put it on top of the flour away from the water the mixes in this collection have the yeast in the flour not packaged separately the bread failed to rise at all why would they package the yeast separately in the single mixes and not in the multi packs along with the collection i also purchased the baker choice collection i am throwing them all out do not waste your money ,terrible , great product
the bread has a good taste but does not rise properly and only makes loaf i checked the temp of the water as suggested with bad results after raising the temp to degrees i got it to rise to loaf pretty expensive for the quality and i will not buy again ,bread , great product
to add to their wet i learned that feeding your dogs the right food from an early age is key to keeping them healthy and with you for as long as possible br br this by far is one of the best natural foods i have purchased and my dogs just love it the holistic is high in protein and very well tolerated by sensitive stomachs this food has never been recalled and is made in it is own plant unlike most major brands out there that are manufactured at the same plant and only under different names the price i find to be fare as i have paid much higher for other holistic food which was not received well by my dogs br br i highly recommend earthborn natural food for anyone who really knows the of feeding your healthy food and for those who really love their pet ,happy healthy dog , great for my dog
food really has made a difference in her overall health coat and energy levels none of the other foods made her coat this soft br br these are bite sized pieces of food that an older or smaller dog would be able to eat mine does not like big chunks of food she prefers the smaller bites so this one is perfect for her oh and upon opening this bag the scent is like meat not bread or preservatives in other foods this food is not greasy either like many of the others we have tried in the past that leave stains on the floor if it drops and she misses a piece br br i d definitely recommend this food to everyone who has a small or large dog the differences you will notice right away in your dog will make you a believer in this food as well ,love this food , great for my dog
earthborn is the best grain free dog food and it is reasonably priced this food is calorie dense and so good for your dogs ,best value in grain free dog food , best dog food ever
i have a great dane she is very food intolerant she cannot tolerate brown rice beef lamb sweet potato nor large amounts of broccoli spinach peas and not too much fiber i chose this dog food because it has meat proteins chicken turkey fish no rice and small amounts of vegetables and is low in fiber this dog food has worked extremely well for her she no longer has soft stools her coat is much better she does not have itching problems and she likes it it is high calorie so she only gets cups per day for her lbs ,good for dogs that are food , my dog loves it
my puppy loves the stuff his poo is proper consistency since switching his coat is beautiful and he treats the stuff like well a treat cannot wait to try the other flavors with him br br the ingredients list is tough to beat for the price br br jim ,solid puppy happy little man , great product
shinier as ever its absolutely beautiful the last time i remember her coat being so shiny was when she was a puppy there is a little gas now and than but nothing horrible and i do feed my dog at night so her stomach works during the night stool is solid and still no smell i also notice my dog shaking her head less because of ears food can cause ear and eye infection so that is satisfying too as for the shedding it has almost stopped its better br br this is definitely the best food we have tried in months we have tried around different brands that gives you an idea of how good it is also it is ridiculously cheap if you know where to buy it this food under is without a doubt the best food money can buy well at least for us it is ,high quality that , great product
and they are as and energetic as dogs half their age we went grain free years ago after one of our dogs got cancer i began reading about excess carbohydrates and how bad they are for our dogs and us initially we used evo because it was great and it was the only grain free we were very happy with it until the price went through the roof we tried several different grain free food over the next year or so some the dogs just did not like some my lhasa allergies a couple of my dogs are to yeast infections and the evo had that problem but it came back with other foods finally we tried earthborn grain free line and voila they love it the price is right no allergies or infections everyone is healthy and happy this is the best food around and the price is right ,healthier dogs of , my dog loves these
since switching our golden from his regular dog food to grain free his skin allergies are much and this grain free dog food is great it smells good even to me and to see it available at amazon with the super saver free shipping is wonderful ,love this dog food , my dog loves it
breakfast and dinner now however after one bag i took her off because the company that makes it has had recalls with other dog food brands they make though was never on the recall list i loved my dog too much to risk it i did not have a lot of dog food options for my area and i was not about to buy her dog food from wal mart all of which contain the ingredient animal digest which i am keeping her from a friend suggested earthborn which is what she feeds her dog and was also sold in my area and just as much as she loved she loved earthborn probably more she was soon an twist and was asking for more this food makes me happy with the good ingredients that are used and her coat shows it i love this product and so does my dog ,great food for those we love , my dog loves it
i bought this because the ingredients seem to be ok but for some reason it made my dogs have to go outside at least times each night overnight for the weeks we gave this to them we changed back to a food they do well on and the middle of the night bathroom trips stopped in days also my older dog tends to get really when she is eating something not good for her and with this food she was constantly digging at the i have no idea what is wrong with this food none of the ingredients stand out to me as being the cause but something in it really my up ,not good , great product
i have to disagree with another reviewer i did not find this pb gritty at all i always but natural pb without any added sugar and also did not find this too sweet it has a nice not overpowering taste of maple great snack on rice cakes ,yummy , not as good as it is
juice which is a way of saying raw sugar on the sugar the sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple it was not very maple y it was gritty sweet and pretty much not great maybe the cane juice to the low moisture content of peanut butter anyway it was a br br i had heard much hype about this peanut butter started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in new york i happen to like and celery with pb a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes i gave it two stars if you are making a confection or cookies it could be very good but as eat alone peanut butter i found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes ,sugar lots not so much , it is the
this superb tasting drink was used at the turn of the for medicinal purposes as it had calming but effects thought to have same effects as but was in but still it is a very popular drink if mixed properly which is dissolving sugar through an spoon and mixing with vodka named the drink was somewhat by the character played by in the movie from hell based upon jack the ,the drink of choice from , not as good as it is
my vodka have never been so refreshing i wish i would have ordered two cases now as my husband and i are going through far too much ,so refreshing and tasty , great taste
i ordered this and several other plants from this seller br br i was quite suprised to find that the plant was much larger than i expected with a full six heads on it and well packed every plant i got in this shipment is thriving and happy it has been two weeks now and nothing has failed to thrive this is more than i can say about others that i have bought from br br i will be buying from this company again ,could not be , not as good as it is
i got this from my mother and love it named him and though i do not have any flies to give him he is growing well you have to be and make sure your trim any heads that start to turn black and not let the plant dry out but is not that much work i cannot wait to get a bell jar for him and keep him in my ,little , great product
i just received the plant i paid extra for a quick delivery to secure the plant condition it arrived on time however it arrived wrapped only in moist news paper without any protection for the plant the plant is completely smashed this was for me a complete waste of my time and money i paid more for shipping than for the item itself and it did not do a bit of good very disappointing ,item arrived damaged , great product
i ordered this item and was not pleased when it arrived however the seller promptly contacted me to make things right they refunded my purchase in full after a photo of the item their response was quick and much appreciated i will likely not purchase plants online any longer however if i do i would not hesitate to consider this seller again mainly because of their customer service ,good service , not as good as it is
healthy plant received on time no issues just the way i like it ,no issues happy customer , great product
there was a little damage in shipment which might be expected but it is growing and catching flies with a little help ,plant , not as good as it
ordered this plant to remedy a fruit fly the amazon shipping was acceptable but the manufacturer does not create the packaging to any shipment unless they were to put this side up on the box the dirt was everywhere but where it was supposed to be and the plant was upside down roots up in the box if i had found one locally i would have bought it there hoping but i do not have high hopes br edit is now do not recommend ,not packaged for , not as good as it is
my new friend arrived with quite a bit of and only heads one crushed i was so upset but i put the moss back into the pot around the base of the plant gave it bottled water and plenty of sun and now i have heads and a very strong plant he back so well eats and is now bright red and green ,dont get , not as good as it is
it came in good shape the plant came a little and two were dead but worth every penny and six head were still alive very happy ,a little , great product
the plant looked great the day it arrived with that said the arrival took an extra week to get here after the first day one of the heads turned and i had to remove it i give it hours of direct a day and always keep the wet i never use tap water only rain and water i still have yet to see any of the heads open i am very nervous that they will not ever open maybe they will send me another one ,pretty nice plant , great product
in black space and the leaves of the plant were inside of a clear plastic cup to keep them from getting crushed there was a disposable heat pack that was placed inside to raise the humidity br br all leaves were green and healthy not many traps were closed it had two adult plant one one i separated them to give them more room in a hanging pot because the three inch pot would not have been long enough for their roots they like over inches of room for their roots if it can be helped fast forward months my has grown and these original venus fly traps have been with growth points they are growing like weeds br br don t forget they like sun and distilled water but be careful when you first get them put them in partial shade for a few days to avoid sun burning ,great plant , great product
the plant was upside down in the box and i had to put the roots back inside the it never came out of shock and turned black and died ,it days after it , great product
i received my plant it was in great condition i have a question the box says its stay in box for im a little confused how is it catch flies if its in a box can anyone tell me the in a not so confusing way lol ,great , great product
this plant arrived packaged it was very healthy and came with good instructions for growing we will enjoy raising these ,healthy interesting plant , great product
i was very pleased with my venus fly trap when i received it it was in good shape and came very quickly we have been having a lot of fun feeding it bugs ,good plant , great product
the plant arrived dead it cost as much to ship i did not want to hassle with any kind of return i should know better than to buy a plant on line ,on , not as good as it is
i received an sickly plant that could not be back to health what was i thinking ordering a plant over the internet never again ,the worst purchase i ever made from amazon , not as good as it is
it only lasted days came mostly dead glad it was only bucks it was also very small so the flies i wanted it to eat it t ,small , great product
i bought this as a gift for my sister and her family who live in arizona they were so excited when it came and it was small enough to not be a bother but big enough to be interesting and pretty they were pleased it came almost right away days and the package was in good shape ,my family loves it , not as good as it is
my plant arrived quickly and packaged very well almost too well cause i was so anxious to see it and it took a bit of time to it the first day it did not want to eat because of the stress from shipping but now it is eating the bugs i give it everybody is so with it and we all love it ,love my plant , not as good as it is
we love the little venus br it healthy hungry and producing new shoots br it arrived quickly and in good condition br altogether a positive experience ,it is a winner , great product
ordered this plant for my seven year old daughter she was extremely excited to get it so i even ordered the express day shipping which i paid over ten dollars for and it still took over a week to reach my house once it got to my house i opened the box expecting it to be a fully established plant which would look similar to the picture shown this is not the case it came as a pot a bag of soil and a damp paper with a very small plant inside maybe inch long there were absolutely no care or instructions or anything like that at all we were pretty disappointed however i was able to plant what was there in the dirt and it seems to have survived and looks a bit better now my daughter is happy with this plant now but it was a rough start ,not so great , not as good as i be
its smaller than i expected i dont think inches is as big as it used to be it comes in this clear plastic box that told me to use said box as a humidity i do not remember seeing a in the little shop movie but i tried it anyway a day later my plant was burned and never br br i d give it more stars if the directions were more clear it was cool seeing the heads close up on things ,shipped then i it , not as good as it is
we live in the country so flies are very this plant is probably stuffed its working each mouth has about three flies i would think that is too many to digest but hey its eating flies like its suppose to ,eater , not as good as it is
i received the faster than expected but it was brown and considerably smaller than advertised i have very little hope that this plant will live out this week but if it does i will update this review with a higher rating ,brown and small , not as good as it is
the plant come early then expected and was in perfect condition so far the plant is doing okay just cannot understand why the traps are turning black after every feeding i try contacting the company but no one was there to answer the phone either way they delivered the plant to my house without it being damaged or smashed i would recommend buying from this company again ,plant was in excellent , not as good as it is
i received this item today and while it is indeed a venus fly trap in a pot i was disappointed to find it is the kind of plant that comes in the clear plastic packaging that is available at a few department stores and garden in my area i specifically ordered a plant on the internet to avoid getting one of these br br i still give stars because it did arrive in pretty good shape and most of the plants like this in stores are not very healthy and after all i ordered a in a pot and that is what i got just know that if you have a local store with a garden center they may have these plants already and you could save the shipping cost by buying one there if you can find one in decent shape ,same as those available in stores , not as good as i have
we love to feed ours i chase flies and around the house sometimes just to watch them eat i would recommend buying some type of for them they need a warm space only use distilled water not filtered these plants are very delicate when it comes to the water you give them i would even go so far as to buy a guide book do not buy the happy plants it is a good book for a kid but it is not a guide on how to raise these plants these plants are a great conversation piece for house guests need i say more enjoy ,fun fun fun , great product
the plant arrived in great condition fully green and with about five or six heads in the clear box that can serve as a will give it our best shot on keeping it up and running this was in much better shape than the venus plants at our local big box do it yourself in their garden area ,my year old is pleased , great product
my in my to buy this plant i accidentally sent this plant to my home address instead of my despite this my plant arrived about one week after i first ordered it had it been shipped correctly it would have taken only four days in addition the plant still arrived in good condition its growing very well br br a few things to note this plant is as stated in a pot do not expect a giant man eating plant my plant came with about seven heads and a flower stem which will hopefully bloom soon the one thing that this plant does not come with his any sort of or other for it though the plant makes up for it make sure to follow the special care instructions with it and the plant will grow fine it is definitely worth the cost and it makes a perfect pet plant ,a great plant , great product
i opened the carton and the plant looked like someone put it in a box and it all up i did not think it would live br it did recover however and a heat was included so i give it stars knocked one for loose packing br i would buy from this company again in hopes they get better at packing ,it was on barely , not as good as it is
the plant arrived it was kinda small but now it is starting to grow new traps and its getting bigger every day i have enjoyed feeding it bugs and i an very satisfied with the product ,awesome plant , great product
this review is based on taking care of their customers if you receive an item that you consider to be they will make it right highly recommend this retailer ,care of their , great product
i ordered this plant as a gift for a friend and was not told until recently that the plant had died shortly after she received it she said she followed care but the leaves started to fall off and it and died i wish i had known sooner but she just told me last week ,plant , great product
two of the three plants were dying and are now dead they all were tiny they are suppose to catch flies but not one fly has been caught because they could not even fit in the bloom rip off do not do business with this vendor ,bad , good
i recieved the fly trap and it seemed fine i put it in a nice sunny area it did good but then days later it just died so i paid for a plant that lived days lol ,days , not as good as it is
my son asked for this plant for his birthday and he is very happy with it it seems to be doing well thus far hopefully it will continue to thrive it was packed well in the box and no damage during shipping ,good quality plant , great product
i received the plant in great condition but soon killed it the directions said not to it and exactly what to plant it in so i bought exactly what it said but did not pay attention to the fact that the medium had rapid in it so it died within days my seven year old loved it while he had it though he even named it fed it and took care of it as if it were a life pet ,i the plant , not as good as it is
i love white but most of what i find in the u s is very coarse it still tastes great but the texture leaves a lot to be desired is amazing the and finest i have ever seen ,best white , the best
whipped peanut butter is not for everyone it is basically just peanut butter whipped up so it has more air in it for some reason however i love it it spreads easier and seems to taste sweeter lighter and fluffier if you are a peanut butter freak definitely give this stuff a try ,peanut butter mixed with , delicious
on the label it says less sugar than regular peanut butter if you read the fine print it is because it less peanut butter that being said it is very tasty ,what a , not as good as it is
my golden retriever loves these bones i ordered them and they arrived in a timely manner however when i opened the box they were old meaning the filling was somewhat dried and did not completely fill the due to once the plastic is removed the filling pretty much falls out very disappointing ,disappointing , not as good as
this is one of the few canned sauces without citric acid their canned ground tomatoes i use all the time for sauce better than imported san marzano and i am an italian american i know my sauce this can be found in some local supermarkets here in ny it is in and in larger cans at sam club for under for a huge lb can in supermarkets i bought it recently at for a oz can on sale regularly priced under for a oz can look for it and try it nice and thick and tasty as it should be an additional bonus for me personally is that it contains no food allergens such as dairy eggs or nuts safe for my granddaughter who is allergic ,love it and free , best popcorn ever
a great sauce if you can find it locally my giant carries it for less than a couple of bucks a can the flavor is great very good tomato taste with a good bit of tanginess not sweet at all but there is a hint of tomato sweetness i never thought i would find something this good in a can i bought one because it looked out of place on the store shelf so it had to be good i have read reviews on a pizza making and most of the people grudgingly its a good sauce ,as good as you can get in a can awesome flavor , great product
do not be put off by the label this is serious excellent pizza sauce the best i have ever tasted out of a can my family has been eating it for years basically there is no need for us to make homemade sauce anymore but do not just believe me google don pizza sauce and read other people rave reviews br br we cannot find it in our local grocery stores so we usually buy a case or two at a time the pop top cans are also a perfect size for a large pie or two br br the company other tomato products sold under the name are also highly recommended ,as good as homemade , best popcorn ever
i grew up in and the local italian food store sold this sauce along with dough and cheese that you could take home to make your own pizza i loved it then and i love it now the only issue is the price at almost per can it would be hard to justify the cost so to be clear stars for the sauce but star for the price ,just like i , great product
there is no better sauce and i think it is even better than most homemade sauces one can will make two large pizzas it is seriously amazing unfortunately it is hard to find but when i do find it i buy all the stock ,mmm , great stuff
potato is a nice and good for digestion the oils and flaxseed are good for the coat being rich in the probiotics digestion the eggs and chicken are good sources of protein you might not need some of the extra ingredients like goji berry for example but they are better than fillers and at the very least to cats br br i recommend this food because my cats love it it is relatively cheap for a quality food and the ingredients are top notch if you want better food go with instinct which my cats love even better especially the rabbit but be prepared to pay much more the absolute best would be to put your cats on a raw diet using pucks of meat prepared by various companies or simply do it yourself if you have researched how to prepare it but this is an even more expensive route ,highly recommended cat food , cat cat cat food
by god is there anything this stuff cannot do br recently when it holy hell i was out of rock salt br with which to the with sure enough br came to the rescue with just a few sprinkles of this remarkable in a can every last bit of that ice did not just melt but literally away leaving bare dry and actually kind of warm br however it managed to turn snow into ice cream also apparently water into wine by alone br however since this i have never been able to these effects except for one br it makes a very rich ,juice , not as good as it is
i was given a track number and told it was delivered to my it never happened i received a refund and am now in the process of for my new reorder ,never received goat milk , great product
recipe was quart milk scoops of powdered milk made warm and allowed to chill br br cup white sugar br br tsp vanilla flavoring you can try other flavorings like banana br br tsp salt br br my electric freezer will freeze this in minutes br br i like the powdered for it is ease and it keeps well i can make up a quart and it will keep weeks so it is on hand and not wasting or someone who has limited use to drink a gallon of milk granted one is used to cow milk but this is something one can get used to if they have allergies and i am glad it comes in a nice metal can with a plastic lid to reseal after you pop the top and a plastic measuring scoop to get it right br br one can will make quarts of milk ,is a ok fine , best ever
taste sweet like cream and then there is a little gamey after taste but nothing like the slap you in the face taste of the powdered i was hoping to save money with the powdered but since it is a chance she will not drink certain cans i am really wasting money i am thinking i will have to stick with the fresh from now on br if anyone has any ideas about what the difference between cans could be i would love to hear it i always have prepared it with filtered water warmed on the stove and mixed it up in pyrex then stored it in a large ball jar in fridge i know i should call the company and talk to them but that would require me to actually remember to do it at a time that they are open and i am able never happens thanks ,some cans tastes good others , not bad but not as good as it is
i used meyenberg powdered goat milk with my first litter of pups five years ago and was very pleased with it so made sure to stock up before my second litter was born i supplement the mother food with it and mix it with ground puppy food to make a puppy to transition the pups to puppy food the pups and their mother seem to love it and have suffered no digestive problems at all it dissolves quickly in warm water and is convenient and easy to store i recommend it as a nutritional supplement for nursing mothers and pups both ,powdered goat milk good for , great product
my almost two year old is allergic to cow milk so we give him a mixture of goat milk and rice milk liquid goat milk is expensive at least where i live so we switched to the powdered form a few months ago i do not drink milk but my son seems to like it okay goat milk products have a distinct flavor that you either love or hate i love it in goat cheese and goat butter but my wife hates it judge for yourself ,my toddler it , great product
this is the best stuff going for a child that is unable to drink formula or soy milk i used it for my son when he was a baby i started him on it when he was about months old because of allergies and his doctor said to leave him on the soy milk even though it was causing him much discomfort i could not just let my son suffer and took it upon myself to put him on goats milk and ended up with a healthy kid and a doctor who was also a convert ,milk , great product
my son is sensitive to cows milk protein and i am trying to keep him off of soy my milk was not enough for him and i did not like the ingredients in baby formula all had soy and most have cows milk protein not to mention corn syrup solids my pediatrician recommended this powdered goats milk because they add not normally found in goats milk since i have been feeding my son this milk he has been so happy and growing so much better have not had to add any vitamins supplements to it to make it a whole food it is fine on its own although i have been using organic brown rice cereal because he is getting close to being ready for solids love this milk always your doctor before changing your babies diet ,great for baby formula , great for
am not sure which was the bigger influence but the quality of our lives is now significantly better br br the nice thing about the meyenberg goat milk is that is easy to prepare just like regular formula liquid goat milk must be kept in the refrigerator and must be warmed not too big of a deal except for those am feedings another nice thing about the meyenberg powdered milk is that folic acid is added remember that if you choose to give goat milk to your baby that you will need to give some vitamins our daughter seems to enjoy the taste and as a bonus it does not have the nasty smell of a href http www amazon com gp product b similac hypoallergenic formula powder case of cans each lb g a br br final verdict so far great let us hope it continues br br stars ,so far great for , great product
we have been using meyenberg powdered goat milk for several years we used to buy their milk in cartons at walmart and it was good the only problem was that we live so far from a walmart store that we would run out of goat milk between trips we decided to try the powdered and found that it mixes and stays mixed very well and tastes exactly like the liquid milk in the cartons of course it stores easily and and we highly recommend it to anyone who wants or has to drink goats milk ,the most way to store and drink milk , great product
my month old daughter can not tolerate cows milk or soy while she was an infant she had to drink formula and would only drink maybe oz at a time once she turned a year old and i began giving her meyenberg goat milk she began to it she loves it so much she now consistently drinks ounces at a time br br i mix one can powdered at a time which makes approx one gallon we go through about a gallon every days br br this milk is such a blessing we highly recommend it amazon has the best price too it is so much more convenient and less expensive to purchase it on here and have it delivered to us rather than make countless and expensive trips to the health food store ,my daughter loves this milk , great product
my daughter is allergic to soy cow milk but tolerated goat milk very well she has been drinking it since she was months it is nice having a powder so we can take it with us when we are on the go there is more information about the milk itself on the meyenberg website after looking over the website i felt confident that goat milk would meet my daughter nutritional needs ,great milk alternative easy to use , great product
my three year old daughter has been drinking this brand of goat milk for the last years because she is dairy intolerant this is a great product easy to carry because it is a powder and mix it when you need it and this is an awesome price less than i usually pay for three cans ,great product , great product
odd man out here but this powdered goat milk is horrible my month old son is allergic to dairy and soy hence the reason for goat milk we were going on vacation for two weeks and i was afraid there would not be any source of goat milk at that being he drinks almost a quart a day of regular liquid goat milk i purchase from trader joe i figured i would go for the gusto and buy a two weeks supply for him it smelled horrible and more importantly tasted horrible words cannot even describe how disgusting this stuff was my poor son almost threw up from tasting it which prompted me to smell it it smelled so bad i could not even taste it myself maybe we are just used to the regular brand he drinks my only advice try a small amount first it is not returnable ,horrible , not bad but not great
this goat milk has been a godsend for our granddaughter who seemed to get sick on every formula we tried the goat milk with a little coconut oil and extra dha became a fantastic infant formula once she started using the goat milk almost all of her issues resolved themselves her skin cleared up completely and her did not look all and dry she looked like the perfect child we knew her to be she is now months and has been using it since she is a month old she has been growing beautifully and perfectly on this powdered goat milk the powder is very convenient too twenty years ago my nephew used goat milk in place of cow milk and also did great his allergies also became a thing of the past all i can say is this is an excellent product ,excellent formula , great product great price
i purchased this product in the hope of it to produce yogurt the yogurt produced by this product was very thin and could not be thickened using only culture br br from the producers website br br note goat milk yogurt is very thin almost like kefir for a thicker consistency add packet of unflavored gelatin dissolved in some of the goat milk br br the product has a distinct aroma not terrible but was stronger than comparable fresh goat milk the flavor of the milk was only acceptable br br in a pinch this product will however i would not personally recommend it for regular consumption ,an product , great product
i tried the condensed version and thought it was horrible so was concerned that i would not like the powdered either before i tried the powdered i had some of the fresh from my grocery store and really liked it as it turns out this is quite the same as the fresh and about cheaper br br we are switching because both of my kids had ear infections and now sinus infections one was always constipated and still is to a certain and one is showing signs of which some believe may be related to a food allergy such as cow milk so i figured better safe than sorry and am switching the whole family ,excellent replacement for milk , great product
my kids enjoy this goat milk product with their cereal and i use it for cooking as well although i have not tried many goat milk products this one is easy since i make what i need therefore there is little waste it is also easy to pack and take when traveling overall i recommend this product ,nice alternative to milk , great product
the last shipment i received when preparing the milk there were black or in it it was in two out of the three containers i do not even know if it was in the first can i used this was the first time it is happened and i have been using goats milk for my daughter since december and she loves it plus it did not constipated her like whole cow milk now i am about buying another batch as it may contain this stuff again ,black in milk , not as good as it is
with the worst smelling spit up the expensive formulas smelled bad and tasted worse i hated giving them to her goats milk was recommended to me her doctor only was that it was low in folic acid and to babies well meyenberg powdered milk is fortified with folic acid so dilute it with a little extra water and you are in business i now have the infant you have ever seen enfamil can take that nasty chemical soup they call formula and it i will never go back br br you can get the formula recipe at br br br there have been concerns about arsenic in rice syrup lately so i have been using golden syrup and she likes it fine also it is the best pancake syrup you will ever have i am going to try barley malt syrup next it is chemically more similar to rice syrup ,fantastic baby formula , a great product for a great price
i have tried pills and special milk with no results br br i use this instead and have none of those symptoms measure into your mixing bowl cup pitcher etc and slowly mix in hot water as soon as it is paste you can add cold water doing it this way prevents clumping br br i like it and add just a touch of sugar or other sweetner kids cannot tell the difference between this and cow milk i use tbs of blackstrap molasses per oz milk it turns the milk light brown think iced coffee but my family does not mind we like the way it tastes and appreciate the extra iron calcium and potassium from the molasses has to be blackstrap this type has only g carbs per tbsp i use less powder than recommended scoops for oz instead of the recommended this helps to the goat flavor ,use it all the time , great product
reading about it on dr website our son has had no problems at all with the formula we add brown rice syrup per our recommendation to add calories our son was a and was for the first months until stress from work affected milk production our son took to the goats milk right away we mixed the first couple bottles with breastmilk until we knew he had no digestive issues with it then were able to give him goats milk by itself the goats milk smells and tastes better when warm than cold i grew up on goats milk myself so the taste does not bother me but my husband is not crazy about good thing our son loves it because that is what really counts it is the cost of cow milk based formula and is easier for tiny tummies to digest it is a win win all around ,great formula , great product
my son recently had a stomach that gave him temporary lactose intolerance buying fresh goat milk in the dairy section is very expensive compared to organic cow milk but most of the milk alternatives do not have enough fat and too much sugar for growing toddlers this powdered goat milk was a great solution it is easy to mix with my formula pitcher even using cold filtered water and the taste is very good my son likes it as much as he did his regular milk this item is hard for me to find locally so i was glad to see it on amazon through s s i plan on keeping this in my pantry from now on in case his intolerance comes back or i run short of regular milk ,easy to mix good for , great product
my baby has had digestive issues from birth at months i put her on this product and immediately saw improvement it did not take long for her to accept it either i found a recipe on the dr website for making goats milk formula for infants and would have tried it when she was younger tip this powder does not dissolve in water as easily as regular formula make a days worth of milk ahead of time and use a wire to mix it ,great for toddler with and soy milk , great product
br br the pros the boy seems to really enjoy his goat milk and does not seem to know the difference between the kind we get in the refrigerated section of our grocery store and the powdered variety it is nice for those emergencies when your local grocery runs out of those few quarts of goat milk it carries it was also good for traveling to grandma and not wanting to take a cooler to store the milk br br the cons it mixes very unless you use really warm water to mix it even then you have to stir stir stir to get the lumps out also once you open it it has a limited shelf life must be because of all of the fat if your intent was to open it up and use every once in awhile until it runs out this product is not for you ,good but , best of the best
i have been so happy with this product my baby girl has always had a sensitive tummy up late hours w pains and crying with nothing to sooth her i finally found this product our suggested it my daughter loves it and it really helped her tummy now i wont her any other formula it organic and difficult to find at local stores in my area i found amazon to have the best price and its easy to have it delivered to the door id suggest this formula to anyone ,i give my baby else , great product
we love the powdered goat milk taking the place of regular formula raw goat milk is one of the closest and most milk to give a baby other then breastmilk and when we cant get raw milk we go with powdered it sits well in his belly and digest great he loves loves loves it i have used this milk for all of my boys and it has proven to be the best formula ever would highly recommend to anyone for their baby unless of course you can get the fresh stuff lol ,my baby , great product
will she be like when completely on the goats milk i have to supplement her with the multi vitamins br i took her recently to her pediatrician her gi their exact words her skin has never been this good before the is working on my daughter diet plan to make sure br she gets all the nutrients which are essential for a growing baby br i did not wanted to make the trips to the whole foods everytime and pay a higher price for this product when amazon is selling on a great price of cans the shipping is free br and the package arrives right on time before i am out of the stock you need to order this product before a week so u never run out of it the packaging is good and the cans are not br damaged or dented br great product br excellent amazon ,to my allergy , great product
i like this milk powder my boys cannot drink cow milk and fresh goat milk can be hard to get this does not get all in the can like some powdered milks and is easy to mix up if you use warm water per the directions it has a nice taste much better than canned and just as good as fresh it has been very useful for traveling as you can mix up a cup or two at a time as needed ,great product , great product
we have been using this stuff for our baby for three years and she loves it ,great stuff , great stuff
are both intolerant to milk my solution is to add a little of the mixed goat milk to vanilla flavored soy milk why would i do this you ask i read that dairy products are the best form of calcium you can get dairy and broccoli enriched products like soy milk are okay sources but not as good as the real deal so i mix the two together to make sure my kids get the best possible calcium intake they can they would not drink it just so though so this company is great cow milk is just not good for people goat milk is better i use to make their mac and cheese and things like that too they can stand the little bit of lactose in the cheese powder and by using the goat milk you cannot even tell there is anything different about the dish very useful ,good to mix with soy milk for my kids , great product
i started using goat milk when my daughter was because she did not digest cow milk that well this product is great has equal or more nutrition than cow milk has a good flavor just slightly different than cow milk is easy to digest and best of all the powder form is great if you are on the go i do not have to worry about it i just mix and give it to my daughter ,great alternative to milk for , great product
goat milk is very good for the digestive system fortunately it performs many that the medical world is not aware of i can remember in the my father his with goat milk he lived until the ripe old age of i have friends who have and over the counter products in favor of goat milk to solve their digestive problems br br even though regular goat milk lasts long in the refrigerator powered goat milk lasts longer and is easily made when you need it plus with the powder you can the quality of the product to your taste br br it good for you and to you ,go for the goat , great product
this is by far the best tasting thing that is come from a goat in years man chowder dairy or goat coat cannot hold a candle to this stuff drink it bake it it it all good ,it is goat , best ever
when i was young my mom owned a couple goats that gave our family fresh milk recently i discovered meyenberg powdered goat milk and was surprised to find out that it tastes just like the fresh goat milk i remember it even has the thick cream layer fresh milk has br br however it would be awesome if the product came in larger cans i ended up the ounce can rather quickly because i used my large blender bottle to mix three cups at a time and this unfortunately one can of powdered milk in record time one can makes cups liquid ,powdered goat milk yum , not as good as it is
after my doctors told me that i needed to supplement with formula and stop as much because my daughter did not gain enough weight i knew i did not want to use i found this goats milk and it not only helped her gain the weight she needed but it did not give her any gi upset this was a god send and my month old is still just as happy as when she was she does not mind the taste and loves her bottles ,amazing , great product

flavor of lamb and i love lamb but this taste is so slight that it is not in kefir which makes the most delicious pancakes or yogurt or in custard or any other baked goods i like the taste and smell of this goats milk better than cows milk br br i also like the powdered milk because i can make it up a cup at a time or a quart at a time as i need it and never have to worry about having to store it in the refrigerator or it going bad or it is very convenient br br it takes a few minutes for it to dissolve and be absorbed into warm water when first mixing it but once it is all dissolved in the water i cannot tell the difference between this powdered milk and fresh milk it dissolves and mixes quickest in a blender ,wonderful product , a great product
i love to feed my kids goats milk but to buy it fresh from the farm is so expensive so this is a great substitute i started my kids on this when i stopped nursing and they have loved it ever since they eat it in their cereal and drink it straight from the cup i think goats milk is the next best thing to breast milk ,love milk , great product

others may have a different experience we were using this as a supplement to mother milk because mother milk just did not seem to provide enough fat protein for baby to gain weight problem although stated that goat milk is easier to digest we found that once we mixed the goat milk with mother milk she ate more and got constipated with we had bought this to help with digestion as formula is based on cow milk this goat milk seemed to have the opposite effect on our baby and she did not gain weight also the taste is not so great br br we can use it as back up in case we do not have milk in the fridge so it is ok but i probably will not buy again ,not , great product
we wanted to use milk that was lactose free and close to breast milk we began using this milk to supplement my breast milk and we now use it full time my baby has never had an allergic reaction to it and he does not spit up it is gentle on his stomach and amazon has it at an inexpensive price i would suggest this milk to any parent that prefers something different than cow milk ,the best milk for my baby , great product

i do not like non organic dairy but this stuff comes close goats are not given or hormones as far as i know the taste is usually very consistent but it does take some getting used to the powder mixes very well and it is handy when on the road and need to mix a protein shake it improves the taste of protein shakes and that is my favorite thing about this very recommended ,great if you and need milk , not as good as it is
excellent stuff my baby is allergic to dairy and soy br this is the only formula she could tolerate it br smells but she loves it when they are under a year br old you add brown rice syrup to give more calories br then you gradually them off of the brown br syrup so by the time they are a year they are drinking br straight goats milk ,wonderful formula , great product
us th largest who just has the liquid br br anyways after weeks of trial error we have a very happy mo baby i wish would have found this milk earlier br i added a mixture of goat milk and pulp free plain coconut water into my daughter feedings and it not only has cleaned her system out but has stopped the colic vomiting reflux constipation and to replace her electrolytes again i will repeat lower iron content equals happier baby we still have the lingering green poops compliments of the iron however the iron tolerance has been greatly no colic no vomiting no reflux and no constipation she has one bottle of coconut water goat milk every day just to keep the gi tract from the excess iron proteins and to replace her ever so important electrolytes ironically she actually takes this formula mixture better than the traditional formulas ,a for , great product

i have been exclusively feeding my son so when the month mark came up and had to introduce solids i was nervous i knew breastmilk was the best thing to mix cereal with but i really didnt want to mess with the of i tried whole milk ok per pediatrician which made him so fussy then water he would not eat it then i did actually try some breastmilk i had frozen from the early weeks of nursing he still refused it i then heard on the dr oz show that goats milk is most like milk and thats what brought me to this product i was so happy to find this product for him he eats his cereal with no problems now and absolutly no tummy problems either no and no formula needed could not ask for anything better highly ,great product , great product

to recover from crohn coconut oil and goat milk were important for reasons you need to read yourself it helped me improve my health too i find i have less congestion allergies and sinus problems br br the flavor can be overcome by a mixing some goat milk into whatever milk you use be it cow soy rice after a while you will not notice it much then you may like it i bet after a month or two of no cow milk you will taste flavor in it our tastebuds change br br i like both the evaporated and powdered milks my cats do too and it has been okay for feeding a sick cat who could not manage solid food br br i am going to make some goat milk products since yogurt is over a plastic cup in maybe cheese will be next goat farmers cheese mmm ,love it u could me w milk though , cat cats love it
it is a very nice milk powder i do not have any allergies in particular but i am genetically lactose intolerant if i have more than glasses of milk in a day my stomach will feel all acidic i do not face that same problem with this milk i drink this over the liquid one sold at stores because this has more value for money and has got folic acid in it be warned though if you do not like the smell of goat meat you might not particularly like this since it has a bit of that smell it mixes very well with hot water and not so well with normal water despite all of that i love it and use it to make my milkshake ,goat nutrition , not as good as it is
my month old has been on this for months and loves it br it is easy to make you do have to shake it a bit when you make it br we add probiotics to it for a little extra immune and it br works great as a substitute for milk br our doc tells us this is easier on the toddlers digestive br system and may even aid in less ear infections br so far so good br amazon has the best deal we could find also ,toddler milk substitute , great product

i do not drink cow milk and was on soy which was me further into remembering that i had liked goat milk when i had the opportunity to drink it fresh from the goat in my home country i started to do some research online to see if it would be a good substitute and what do you know it was yes it is not fresh straight from the goat milk but being able to have it again has been a blessing thank you for both the powdered and evaporated milk thank you amazon for offering it a price that is not breaking my purse ,life milk , great product
i do not find the taste of this goat milk very pleasing if mixed to use in liquid form i have had fresh goat milk and frankly this does not come anywhere close even with reasonable expectations because of the powered form it does however have its use in my kitchen in baked goods where the flavor even if slightly sour can be of use certain bread pancakes and the like do very well if i add this mix instead of other milks or water good to have in the pantry for those just in case days ,a little sour but great for baking with , great product

this stuff apparently has a shelf life of many weeks even after opening and it tastes ok in tea and coffee once you get used to it which is more than i can say for soy milk br br but i give it just stars because it is so hard to mix now if they added some modern chemicals to allow easier mixing even if it caused an allergic reaction i still would not vote for ,lacks , not as good as it is
the can does not say no antibiotics i called the company and asked why the can does not say this first she tells me that they have no antibiotics but the fda will not allow them to put it on their can i said lots of companies put no antibiotics on their label then she said we are making a new label i felt a attitude i felt like she just wanted me to get off the phone br br well i just canceled my for their goat milk i am now looking for another goat milk that puts no antibiotics on their label i know that there are some good goat milk companies that do this ,no more , not as good as it is
this is great for a quick easy versatile dessert when you do not want to heat up the oven although it does not taste exactly like cheesecake it is a pretty good cheesecake like dessert for the price i like to make the mini suggested on the box and top them with fruit one note of caution amazon cost per box is a little high in this pack of each box of mix costs about but a box costs around in my local target so i recommend this product and i suggest buying it at a local store ,yummy dessert , great product

for boxes br br is this a rare item br br that a box br br i think the item might be a bit overpriced ,for boxes , not as good as
i am rather about this product granted it does taste like actual chrysanthemum tea like the ones you get at sum places when brewed hot however it tastes bad when iced and mixed with sugar it does not taste like chrysanthemum tea at all once it is iced and combined with sugar the tea is enjoyable hot without sugar but it is way too light i need to double or triple the recommended amount of blossoms to get a decent amount of flavor and by then i am pretty much done with the entire canister too pricey for me ,it is , not as good as it is
chrysanthemum tea taste great with lemons and chrysanthemum tea is caffeine free that is great for pregnant women and those with high blood pressure ,tea taste great with and , great tea

my husband says these pretzels are great and he loves them however on the box i saw a warning that says the pretzels are made in a facility that produces peanut butter therefore i cannot eat them so for those of you with peanut nut allergy i would urge caution ,if you have a peanut allergy beware , not as good as
they are not hard as a rock or so soft that if you dip them they will break for a diet pretzel these are great but then again of has been at it for a long time ,one delicious , good for you
pretzels are too easy to just keep eating until the bag is done therefore a calorie option gives me the i need before i open another snack sized bag to decide and therefore think before just eating all packages yikes we use them in lunches as snacks as halloween treats at the beach at the at work in the car now i am becoming a dr book br br the shipments we have received so far have not been stale soggy or out of date ,snack , great for
as a i am always looking for high quality reasonably priced snacks to offer to my customers on my trips is a brand and i appreciate being able to purchase bulk quantities of their pretzels at such a great low price ,of , great taste
this is a great deal for the amount of pretzel packs that are given we love these since they are only calories each and perfect for a snack pair with a sandwich or just to stick in your purse if you get hungry ,great price and yummy , great snack
they are just that calorie bags of pretzels tends to have one of the best tasting pretzels according to my taste buds these bags create instant portion control and are a great value for the price especially with subscribe and save i also throw them in the kids lunch bags and keep some in the car for road trips ,calorie yummy , great product
great buy but it seems that they are not very popular in my office less healthy chip snacks are more popular still a great product fresh and tastes like a pretzel should without any additives ,too healthy for most people in my , great snack
do you seriously need a review for pretzels it is either going to be these pretzels are delicious or maybe these pretzels are disgusting thats pretty much all you can say about pretzels i personally think they are delicious but of course i like pretzels if you dont then probably want to go the other way on this one ,are you , good but not great
i personally think these are the best pretzels on earth i have to admit that when it comes to eating pretzels these are the first in my mouth ,a darn good , great
morning it is nice to have a hot cup of coffee to wake you up while you watch the news we have always drunk maxwell house coffee and even when i was a child my parents used it it is one of the best coffee brands available as we have gotten older we needed to consume less caffeine and we actually brew a mixture of part of this coffee and part of the maxwell house decaf blend it helps us reduce our caffeine and we still get to enjoy our coffee in the morning with just a little kick in it br br the price of the coffee here is about the right list price but the shipping is a on sale at a local store we get it for less than half the price and no shipping this is a very good product and i recommend it to you ,a favorite coffee in our home , good coffee but not a great price
for coffee drinkers who buy maxwell house coffee this is a deal buy two cases for just over free shipping too seriously you know i stocked up ,fantastic deal , good coffee
when it does come down to my mornings i always do enjoy a good cup of coffee to start my days off right but i have chosen to drink more ground coffee than instant these days but it has also been much harder finding the right kind of great tasting cup and that does definitely come well with maxwell house and the simple original roast blend the taste is definitely simple and not too string for most new coffee drinkers but enough to get your mornings off to a great start with each and every savory cup while there are not many great brands of coffee that ve shown that test of time maxwell house has been one that has not lost its shine i absolutely recommend this brand each and every time br br price b br br taste b br br overall b ,good to the very last , good coffee but not a great price
my husband is a big coffee drinker and with a deal like this i can order ahead and never have to worry about running out i hate to have to run to the store because i am out of one thing ,good deal , good coffee
what can i say great cookies the only way to improve it is if it came with some cold milk ,they are , great snack
pamela baking and pancake mix is very very good however know when you order in the small packages you are not getting the baking mix you are getting individual or for two people servings of pancake and waffle mix this formula is different than that for the larger packages of baking and pancake mix and does not make biscuits muffins or other short breads very well too sweet for my taste if you are looking for great tasting pancake or waffles in a smaller package then this is for you if you are looking for a great baking mix as well as pancakes and waffles then get the larger packages ,not exactly what i thought i was getting , great for pancakes
i have tried many different cheeses and i have to say is my most favorite br br the texture aroma and flavor is both bold and pleasant yet not overbearing br br a highly recommended cheese for cheese ,my new favorite cheese , delicious
i have been drinking v juice for many years ordering it from amazon by the case with free shipping prime allows me to have it on hand in a convenient can with the right amount for my needs ,great product in perfect size can , great taste
the package arrived with all the cans inside of a cardboard tray that was wrapped there was no damage to the cans and they tasted just fine br br as far as v itself br br i enjoy using v as a meal replacement replacing a greasy breakfast think of it as tomato soup with a little less flavoring it was an acquired taste for me that i have since come to enjoy if you find that the original is a bit on the bland side you can try the spicy flavor as a nice alternative the only drawback is that spicy has a bit more sodium ,great packaging great taste , not as good as it is
he says it tastes great and is a great snack for his diabetes good source of vitamins for him great shipping on our second order ,great for husband , great for
great price and we did not have to leave the house and shop i really love the fact that there is no trouble with ordering great product ,great , great product
filled with inflated plastic to when i opened the box although all the flip tabs appeared to be intact one can had leaked some of it is contents and the juice was all over the other cans and inside the box i the cans to find out which one s had leaked and that is how i determined which one to throw away the weight of the cans but the was consistent except one can was a few ounces short i am hoping it was just from the one can and i do not turn up with down the road since this was a ups delivery i am kind of surprised that amount of pressure was put on this package usually get superior service from them i have ordered like this in the past and the product arrived in perfect condition so as i said i was disappointed this time ,disappointed , a great product
yes it is mainly a tomato juice and yes it has sodium in it but it is definitely still better than drinking coke and its just a better alternative of drinks to bring to school or work ,its , great taste
tastes like v cuz it is v o delivered on time my doctor says i dont get as much nutrition benefit as i thought i did because of the process but i dont eat lots of veggies and i like this stuff sooooo i drink it anyway ,i like it , not as good as it is
i have been a vegetarian for years and have a meat eating husband for years i have been looking for a good ground beef substitute i finally found one this one had a good taste and texture when cooked my meat eating husband is even happy with it when i use it one of the things i love is that i use this to make meatballs and they stay together in the past they never stayed together this is a great product and i am happy i found it ,great substitute , great product
very meaty texture for a vegetarian product looks like fresh ground beef after you mix it with water i would recommend this product i also want to try the sausage variety ,texture , not as good as it is
i first received a bag of harmony valley as a on a on com i was very pleasantly surprised at the texture and taste i made stuffed green peppers with it just as you would a traditional recipe substituting the mix my husband who is a avid meat eater really enjoyed it and said he would not mind eating more often i also made the sausage style in an with peppers and onions and it was tasty i ordered a pack of six of the burger mix right here on amazon ,very good substitute for ground , not as good as it is
i am a meat eater my wife vegetarian she picked some of this veggie burger mix up to try and we both really like it i am not saying it tastes like beef but i do not believe it is supposed to it is really good and i would recommend it to anyone ,eater likes this mix , not as good as it is
i have been a vegetarian for about a year now so i am relatively new to the meat substitute market but this is by far the best veggie burger mix i have tried far better then any of the frozen patties you can get in grocery stores an added bonus is the versatility of the mix you can use it for many different things instead of just being stuck with patty form like the frozen variety my meat eating girlfriend really likes this as well and she tends to be pretty picky ,best mix i have tried , best mix ever
i tried the vegetarian hamburger mix and i liked it more than any other burger substitute i have tried i made it into steaks and topped them with a mushroom gravy delicious a href http www amazon com gp product b h harmony valley vegetarian hamburger mix ounce pack of a ,mix , great product
i have used harmony valley hamburger substitute several times now and have been very happy it is spiced and tastes pretty close to a mixture when used in sauce or to stuff peppers i cannot tell that it is not hamburger meat i was thrilled with its performance and its ease of use i cannot wait to try it in other recipes ,delicious substitute , not as good as it is
great product br br i purchased this product from our local fresh market i am a vegan and am always looking for different meat substitutes to try i used this mix to make some taco this stuff was perfect i even got my non veg father to try a bite of the tacos and he thought they were good as well that right there is saying something because my father is really about meats br br i have another packet in which i am going to cook up today ,very tasty , great product
some of my family are vegetarians but the rest are die hard meat eaters this is one product that the whole family will eat we like it as burgers but we love it as and meatballs in spaghetti we like that it keeps a good texture even when in sauce i love that it has the texture and bite that hamburger has as an extra bonus i am on weight watchers and it is low in points ,it is the best , i love it
those people cannot wait half an hour for a burger if you want an instant veggie burger that can be in the time it takes you to grab the ketchup buy a frozen burger i think this mix will be good in better handmade veggie burgers and i look forward to trying br br addendum br br after eating the made with the hv mix both my husband and i experienced horrible stomach bloating and pain i am apparently a for though because i decided to give it another try and made meatballs with it yesterday not only did they not turn out as good as my usual ones made with mf crumbles and sausage they had a sort of texture that i really did not care for but and texture i can overlook except again the product gave us both the same horrible stomach bloating pains and gas ugh ,mixed review convenient okay taste bad stomach problems , not bad but not as good as it is
we just received a package of the hamburger mix from one of our friends as a gift we loved it i am vegetarian and my husband is a meat eater i whipped up some stuffed bell peppers using the mix and it was delicious i love that it is a great price as well ,yummy , great product
i love all three products that harmony valley has but the vegetarian hamburger mix is my favorite we love to make taco salad joes meatballs hamburgers steak spaghetti with this great product if you love the store bought burgers that are found in the section of your store these are times better so fresh tasting gmo free thanks harmony valley for making such a great safe to eat product p s the plant is ran on wind power gmo free is the way for me ,make this your product for , great for
i have tried almost every kind of fake meat product out there while i really like the morning stars and the ground meat you cannot really make them into anything br br this product was great soak it for minutes in water and you have a really good ground meat you can make something out of the only problem is that it tends to be a little for my taste so be when you are seasoning it ,great product but a little salty , delicious
making the chili i was a little worried so i cooked up all my veggies and seasoning in a separate pot browned this beef in another pan and added it into the mix later cooking this alone it smelled funny and i was worried it would taste the way it smelled i am very sensitive to smell and taste of things i can taste this in the mix of things but not so much more than anything i am busy looking for a taste one thing i can say is the texture is pretty good for the consistency of meat except its much lighter and thinner less than real ground beef if i had to give up beef for the rest of my life and pick this i would not but if cows disappeared off the face of the earth i would be fine with taking this as a substitute ,helps with fat diet , not as good as i be

semi sweet dark chocolate bar is by far their best bar in my opinion the is pretty good also but it is more smooth and balanced whereas the is just goodness from start to finish and has a wonderful creamy flavor br br i ve tried their and also their espresso one the is the best by a long shot then the comes in nd place the others are very good too but do not quite have the amazing overall rich creamy of the bar br br if you are not sure which bar to buy the bar is an excellent choice if you like see candy and or godiva then you will be right at home with this bar it is one of the single best dark chocolate bars i have ever had in my life ,this is their best bar by far , best ever
wolfgang puck recently changed their chicken soup the old stuff is excellent the new stuff is watered down not filling and does not taste as good the image and description on this item stated that it was the old soup the soup i received is the new stuff being a food item returns are not allowed i feel this was false and am extremely ,not what i ordered , not as good as i have
you will not find better tasting soup anywhere i initially purchased it because my wife is sensitive to msg and other kinds of additives that are found in most soups after eating some myself i now keep a supply on hand for all of the family ,the best in soup , not as good as it is
this soup is absolutely delicious the chicken tastes like real chicken not processed fake meat and the wild rice adds just a bit of yummy crunch for some reason i think it is way better than the chicken noodle one if you eat strictly organic it is perfect for when you do not have time to make a fresh meal ,the best , delicious
bland and slimy i decided to try it a minutes ago because i was desperate for something healthy and convenient because i was a tad sick and could not make my own meal with the ingredients i had home i bought it for about and hoped i just had a bad can of soup the first time but this was just awful no taste slimy and hardly any chicken probably tiny pieces i can see why they added such little chicken it is just tasteless and dry tasted nothing like chicken i will go try another can of soup that can make me feel a bit better this sure did not do it i have never had soup that tasted bland even after adding salt and seasoning i see positive reviews that make me thing i had another bad can because i still cannot believe it had absolutely no flavor ,bland and disappointing , not bad but not as good as it is
this soup has no flavor broth had a slimy consistency instead of a liquid y one i was so disappointed ,disappointed , good
i normally hate canned soup but this one is an exception great flavor and the chicken carrots and rice actually seem real not imitation or over processed like all the other canned soups i have tried ,yummy , great taste
delicious organic full of flavor and a hit at our house plump rice fat carrots tasty chicken a great soup ,very yummy chicken and rice , delicious
is very limited br br don t like the bpa issue either i did speak to wolfgang puck about and their plans like most they are water to see what the government friends of the fda does or does not do about it what is a little more poison added to the current mix in processed foods br br ever notice that most of the wolfgang puck soup ingredients here on amazon end at contains or less of the following br br as i indicated above we did try this soup and it tasted ok nothing special try adding a little more sea salt it is better than the msg enhanced preservative laden campbell brand crap a brand we would not buy regardless of one never knows who actually made this soup br br we consider the organic versions the lesser of insert remaining and have a case in case ,ok for food , not as good as it is
i love rice and this was good with all kinds of textures i am allergic to so many things but this soup was awesome and no hives win win ,awesome wild rice , great product
this soup is incredibly good but honestly i was looking for a better deal through amazon the free shipping is great but it is over bucks a can and i can get it cheaper through my grocery store they are always having wp sales for bucks a can a can so does anyone know about a better deal than this it is a really good tasting soup ,really great taste price should be less though , not as good as it is
it is my favorite soup and you cannot beat the amazon price with free shipping thanks for making my favorites available ,yummy , great product
i love having a soup that is healthy and not full of bad ingredients i like the chicken noodle better but the rice is pretty good too ,love wolfgang puck , great taste
this soup is simply the best been ordering for a very long time and will continue to do so br great soup and product ,wolfgang puck organic chicken with white wild rice soup , best ever
the soup itself was excellent a nice well tasting mix of meat veggies and wild and white but surely a few more chunks of chicken could have been added i bought it at local grocer two cans for ,more chicken please , best ever
very tasty but my only complaint is that it is very oily if you let it sit and cool it a fatty skin and my plastic spoon gets a film on it while i am eating i gave it stars anyway b c it is still the best canned chicken and rice soup i have ever tasted but outside of canned soup homemade is always better ,tasty but chicken soup , great product
in as i understand it you are not supposed to about anything where you do not have direct experience you can discount this review if you want since i have only second hand experience with this soup br br i gave a case of this soup to a young friend who is a college student i worry about her starving she never mentioned whether she liked the soup so i asked she finally that it was to quote her the worst thing i have ever tasted apparently her boyfriend also tried it and thought it was bad as well while my friend is rather picky her boyfriend has a much culinary range so if they both disliked the soup i am to think it is not very good ,the worst thing i have ever tasted , not as good as it is
very good white chocolate and very fresh too thank you for wrapping securely quick shipment was appreciated very much ,and fresh , great hot chocolate
i found this exact same product same size at our local grocery store and safeway for so am not sure why this product is priced so much higher ,around , great product
over the local grocer regular price i expected a fair market price when i placed this order but because i did not research it i was extremely disappointed to find it so inflated live and learn i hope i can save someone else the trouble of having to make a return ,off , not as good as it is
first quality dogs like it and it does not have grain as an ingredient therefore a reduction in ear infections due to yeast infections ,premium dog food , my dog loves them
my dogs love this food and with the limited ingredients and low it makes it great for them as well ,natural grain free and my dogs love it , my dog loves them
and inflammation scale this is one food i try to eat everyday i live in a pretty town in the central valley of california and you would think our high end supermarket would carry organic lentils but of course they don t and even if they did i would have to pay an arm and leg for them amazon is my for quality organic foods and other products incidentally i do not make the typical lentil soup with these i simply cook one bag oz with about cups of non bottled water fluoride is extremely bad for your salt them to taste and only cook them for minutes this way they do not get mushy they keep their firmness without being too chewy more like a bean and then i keep them in the fridge for a week and have them with a little organic shredded cheese on top yummy ,top super food , great product
these are such high quality beans no stones great taste cook and freeze and perfectly i will order again and again ,great , great
what i like about these is that they are gluten free full of flavor and have a hearty corn flavor they are a bit thicker than some of the chips i have tried out there and hold the salsa love these ,yummy , great taste
these chips rock we have tried just about every kind of chip lately looking for something that is lower priced more natural but still taste good these chips taste great perfectly salted not too salty and can be enjoyed plain excellent crunch and corn flavor and best of all the shape the long shape are the perfect size for dipping and are just thick enough to hold any dip or salsa best part they are made with only natural ingredients ,perfect chip for salsa and , great chips
i love the crunch taste of the corn strips my whole family loves them too ,love love love , delicious
my husband and i love these chips they are not very salty and the strip shape makes them great for dipping in salsa dips two of my favorite things about these chips though when you open the bag the bag still looks pretty full unlike many other brands where the bag look half full at best when you open it there are not ever very many broken chips ,excellent chips , great chips
these chips are my family favorite they are absolutely fabulous with guacamole because they are not too salty they pick up salsa well too especially fresh salsa because of their shape you get just the right amount of salsa these chips do not take over the dip they compliment whatever you dip them in they are fine without dip also but if you are used to a salty chip you might find them a bit plain tortilla chips are a staple at our house and these are the best you can get except in an authentic mexican restaurant br br hope you enjoy them as much as we do ,best chips ever , great chips
if you are looking for a healthy natural tortilla chip for dipping you should try these i bought these for the holidays and we enjoyed dipping them in a corn black bean and red pepper salsa the shape is perfect for dipping br they re all natural low calorie chips that taste great you can eat chips for calories the chips are big and can be broken in half for more dipping one serving of chips is only of your allowed fat and there is no trans fat and little saturated fat cannot wait to try them with guacamole great treat for parties ,great for , great chips
this is a mild buttery cheese my favorite cheese made in the united states ,favorite cheese made in the , best ever
i bought these for my grandson who is months old he loves them and they are just the right size for a snack between feedings his mom likes the convenience and ease in taking them along i like ordering these and having them shipped directly to their house it makes me feel like i have sent them a little present that is practical and appreciated ,convenient and good , my dog loves these
my son is months old and this has always been his favorite baby food it is nice a thick which he loves ,love it , great product
i am a bit of a foodie and have become quite picky over the years i have to say hands down this is my favorite olive oil it is affordable and non amazing flavor i use a lot of olive oil in cooking and this is great for that and just by itself to a piece of bread through or to drizzle over i definitely recommend this to anyone looking and of what to buy because who knows but this one is a keeper and a must try ,my husband is italian but i on with olive oil , great product
purchased two looking for an oil to put in salads on bread etc something with a strong flavor of olive oil this is not it this is good for cooking has little flavor ,good for cooking , great product
i purchased this food coloring hoping it would create black frosting i read several reviews on this and other websites which suggested i use chocolate icing as white icing black food coloring frosting but this product did not the chocolate at all i ended up using over half for one cake and still decided the color was not right it was still obviously brown perhaps my expectations were too high ,waste of money , not as good as it is
distinctive adding a bold delicious flavor to fresh salads cooked vegetables and roasted chicken and meats i have tried many other brands of extra virgin pure select or other types of olive oils growing up in an italian household and in my years none of them the taste buds with the savory satisfaction delivered by extra virgin olive oil the product is not widely known but the at in italy have developed as good a commercial product as is currently on the market and in my opinion it is the very best the cost is high but consistent with the higher end oils but if you enjoy fine foods and preparing aromatic dishes simply put this oil turns them into a gift use it and enjoy the satisfying reaction and comments of dinner guests as they realize they are being treated to a very special experience quality makes a difference ,quality olive oil at it is best , great product
sure this rawhide is expensive at dollars per rawhide however it is excellent quality many rolls very tightly rolled and takes my gsd hours to go through one for reference he can eat a thick bully stick in minutes and a dog chew in minutes for the time spent chewing per dollar these are a deal i also love that my dogs cannot get big chunks off so even though i keep an eye on them i have very little fear of choking ,best available anywhere , great product
i mix scoops of this and two scoops of formula in my son bottle and it keeps him full longer my mother says she used it on me when i was a child and it kept my and me full my son seems to really enjoy it ,great for one year , great product
well it is funny but even though i am yrs old i love eating this in many flavors i was born here and did not get the chance to grow up on this till almost three where my family went overseas and they used this nestle brand and i am hooked till now it is really hard to get it here as i live in so i order it online br i really like it and would recommend it and will defiantly feed it to my kids when i get some ,i love it and i am , not as good as it is
this the best flavor out of all the others my loves it and it is easy to make and very nutritional too ,love it , great
sweet tasty but there is not sugar baby love it better than gerber like or brand ,baby food , great taste
this is a great product my son loves it still i like better the cereal with honey that somehow is not available in the us but you can find it in europe ,great product , great product
i switched to sea salt a couple of years ago and have found these mccormick very handy ways of my attraction was the price this deal is better than any i have found in local grocery stores even with shipping handling well worth the price shipment was fast no breaking or damage this is one of those more bang for your buck deals worth it ,great deal , great taste
those were just personal preferences of people generally not fond of those flavors in each instance i thought the flavor combinations were both well chosen and perfectly balanced br br overall you could not ask for better quality in a packaged cookie i only regret that the chocolate raspberry coconut lime and vanilla cream varieties were not available to try as well very highly recommended br br ingredients br br wheat flour br butter br sugar br honey br almonds br natural almond flavoring br lecithin br raising agent sodium br br each g oz package contains cookies or servings of cookies br br nutrition per serving of cookies br br calories br calories from fat br total fat g br saturated fat g br trans fat g br cholesterol mg br sodium mg br total carbohydrates g br dietary fiber less than g br sugars g br protein g ,english honey almond all butter biscuits , the best cookies ever
my and years old both loved this lip food it has given them more energy and their coats are looking wonderful in fact when you open the bag the food smells like fruit and veg changing to which is small kibbles from the old food does take a process for the older dogs not because of its size but because of its high quality lastly the company has never had a recall on its products something we all look for today ,my love it , great for
we lived in for years and always loved the availability of fresh seafood especially oysters now we live about hours away and i do miss being able to by the seafood market when i am in the mood i had no idea that i could have it delivered to my doorstep within a couple of days it was well packed and smelled as fresh as if we bought it off the impress your friends and throw together an pasta dish so much better than the stuff in the small plastic containers at the grocery store these were huge ,fresh as it gets , great product
perfect starter tree it is adorable and the included tells you the of bonsai i bought this for my mother in law for mother day a live tree instead of cut flowers makes a great gift ,very nice , great product
i bought this for my boyfriend as a day gift and he absolutely loved it its an amazing size and includes all the essentials for a starter kit it arrived extremely quickly even though i chose standard shipping it arrived in a medium sized box and alot of packing peanuts which kept the tree stable and safe throughout shipping overall i will definitely chose to order from again because i was satisfied and absolutely love it ,amazing , great product
i received my tree quite quickly despite the holidays when i got the tree it was packaged very well and i do not think anything short of getting run over by a train could have broken the tree i called after i got the tree and the exchange i had with the person on the other end was very helpful and i could not be more pleased with their service these guys show great care and to the customers br br all in all a fantastic buy ,had a bit of a mix up but service was superb , not as good as it is
the tree is nice but that is the only part besides the pot did not come with a drip tray as promised instructions were lacking information and were merely a printed piece of paper ,nice tree but where is the , good
as far as noodles in a cup goes this is one of the best i have had actual small chunks of dehydrated veggies mostly mushrooms and onions that i could make out noodle quality and a very hot and spicy seasoning mix they do not show it on the picture here but i am pretty sure this is the hot and spicy cup it looks exactly like the one i just had but the words hot and spicy are just to the left of the and are not visible in the pic if you like spicy noodles definitely do not pass this up br br very good ,tasty , great product
i used to eat noodle for years and that remains my favorite however it has beef stock in it and i cannot eat it anymore i checked out the whole line at my grocer for a vegetarian noodle and this cup is all i could find it tastes virtually identical to the bowl but is vegetarian its spicy and the noodle is of a better quality than the cent packages i grew up on you cant go wrong with but i thought that vegetarians should know about this soup br br so i just read on the description that it contains beef but the cup that is in my hands right now does not say that i may post a picture as proof ,the best for , not as good as it is
i really enjoy this noodle cup mostly because of the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the soup the noodles taste firmer and less like the cheap kind that would regularly come out of one of these instant noodle packages the flavoring has just the right amount of spice and is not excessively spicy ,best instant cup , good but not great
i pass around favorable very seldom but this is one of those occasions br br i m almost and this bacon would be as almost identical to the bacon i ate if it were a bit and had the rind left on br br if you want the old time southern bacon without all the salt and the rind this is it br br i ll admit i do salt the bacon just a tad before i fry it br br this is good stuff if you appreciate great bacon ,the real deal almost , not as good as it is
the product was fair not as country as i would like but better than you find in a grocery store ,country bacon , not as good as
this ghirardelli mint dark chocolate tastes really good the chocolate is not too sweet nor too bitter it is also not too creamy or milky as far as the mint filling it adds some more sweetness to the chocolate but at the same time the mint is very refreshing perfect to have after dinner or as a dessert br br if you like mint chocolate you might also want to try the after eight mint chocolate they are very good too also try the ghirardelli peppermint bark chocolate which is kind of interesting taste a combination of chocolate dark chocolate with white chocolate and peppermint crust br br ,i love this mint dark chocolate perfect for after dinner or as a dessert , not as good as it is
i bought this because i was craving dark chocolate and thought mint sounded great at the time the chocolate is way too sweet dark chocolate is supposed to be a little bitter not too much but enough to give it some bite i guess ghirardelli decided to cancel that out by adding more sugar add to it the super sweet mint filling and i could barely finish a square it was so sweet considering the expense i expected a much better quality ,too sweet , not as good as it is
both my friend and i love this product the dark chocolate and the mint really supplement each other a little expensive but excellent quality ,chocolate mint , great
my mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven they did not believe they deserved receiving these but i know they did deserve to receive these ,chocolate heaven , good flavor
various proteins i tried in case you are wondering there is no cholesterol in this protein either texture and overall are great i drink it mixed with water with no issues flavor is decent obviously none of us are drinking protein powder expecting a gourmet flavor this protein is decently tasty if you like chocolate not as good as most whey casein proteins but better than almost all non whey proteins i tried quite a few of those as well before that i could not tolerate dairy proteins be warned the vanilla version of this product tastes terrible in my opinion it is barely drinkable br br four stars overall if i had no food sensitivities i might still use this in with whey protein but would probably not use it exclusively br five stars if you cannot have whey protein br br i hope that this review is helpful ,best non non soy alternative , great product
be disappointed br br i found that if you live in a state like florida you will need to make sure that you screw the lid to the protein power on tight if you this power to high humidity you will have a terrible time with it clumping and mixing properly br br general tips for drinking protein drinks i have found that eating a granola bar while drinking a protein drink helps first biting the granola bar then taking a drink i found this to work for me and it makes the occasional protein clump less noticeable br br is there room for improvement yes loads of room for improvement is there anything better i have not found it yet but i am still looking i will give this high marks until i find something better please leave a comment if you find a better non whey protein product ,protein review , a great product
good taste mixes easy and has no artifical sweetners i been using this one for years ,great product , great
if you are concerned about digesting dairy and soy products you can rest assured that this is the protein for you it is a nice vanilla flavor with no and no artificial sweeteners i love it and i know my body loves it no digestion problems ever rock on ,best to , great taste
fast as you can i recommend but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people including myself br br there been a lot of regarding the high protein for gain weight loss and the seems to still be out however what i can say for sure because doctors and have told me is that more than g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term also the ideal ratio for fat protein varies by body type and desired goal the best way to learn is through trial and error personally a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me but that is only ideal for the short term br br i definitely recommend this product for either people who cannot take whey or for those wanting to get lean pure egg is a purely brilliant idea ,superb when you cannot or even when you can , love it
i have been using this protein powder for about a month the first thing i noticed is that this brand mixes better than optimum nutrition egg protein but still not like whey or even rice protein the texture is not great by itself in my opinion not awful but not great i have been mixing garden of eating super seed with the powder before adding water and it mixes to a much better texture i have also tried blending the two with ice to make a which turned out ok for those of us who cannot tolerate the whey or soy proteins this particular brand is the best i have found ,a for , great product
been a fan of egg protein for a while now as whey me and gives me indigestion that being said the only whey i have found that does not bother my stomach at all is a href http www amazon com gp product b optimum nutrition platinum whey chocolate protein a br br the chocolate tastes pretty good with water although i do not really care about taste and is actually pretty darn good with rice milk it also tastes good in smoothies i use frozen bananas and rice milk br br only downside is you may get gas initially and you are going to smell things that no human should smell this pretty quickly though br br oh and do not buy the vanilla flavored powder because it tastes like soap i use it in smoothies and it a little vanilla flavor but it is still not very good ,this is a great alternative to , not as good as i be
compared to other egg proteins i have recently used this one is very sweet it is sweetened with splenda so still very low in actual sugar carbs i prefer to use an unsweetened version and put fruit in the blender with it to naturally sweeten it but my wife likes this one b c its easy to in milk we use almond milk with a spoon no blender required ,tasty but too sweet , not as good as it is
in general egg protein does not have the best taste since it has a mild flavor mixing with other ingredients e g bananas work well ,great value for protein , great product
i really like this protein drink i am pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat this is the perfect solution i usually mix it with a combination of plain almond milk and half water i also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions otherwise i find it too sweet the nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie filled sugar of some sort i prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often gmo and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy or for anyone actually and whey protein is a dairy product which i generally do not tolerate well egg protein is perfect for my needs ,low calorie high protein great taste , great taste
i use this as a whey soy protein alternative i am allergic to soy and have sensitivity to whey and this product seems to be free of both i actually have not used it as a shake but i use it to make protein pancakes i find i have to add extra cocoa powder to make it more chocolatey and stevia to make it more sweet at first i came out with some really awful pancakes but after i found the perfect ingredients to doctor it up they all come out amazing so if your looking for an alternative to whey and soy i definitely think this is a good choice ,it is good once you it up a little bit , not as good as it is
what is in this stuff where is the list of ingredients br br i do not eat anything unless i know and approve of what is in it br br for example although this product description says it contains no sugar it does not say if it contains any artificial sweeteners which are also bad for you br br for one thing aside from tasting awful artificial sweeteners often cause horrendous intestinal cramps and diarrhea br br in addition to having long ago given up the eating of sugar and sugar in all its e g natural cane juice fruit juices raw sugar organic sugar etc i also stopped ingesting artificial sweeteners of any kind br br so what is in this stuff ,what is in this stuff , not as good as it is
this but it is a fact america has an with dairy and sweets if you look at any tables that show protein in our bodies you will see this fact eggs and fish are rated at the top for best and in the human body eggs are around while fish is around and chicken around whey and dairy are below all of these this is precisely why whey is so cheap and that is why it is so popular sure the egg protein is going to be more expensive but it is a better product br as far as taste and texture i find it just as good as the whey products that i have used and even better then some i have tried some whey powders that were just aweful i have a lb tub of metabolic whey that i tried it is still sitting in the back room ,the best protein out there , a great product
so i bought a lb tub of that i found that while the on protein has a little fat and more carbs in it it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps unlike the healthy n fit product i also like the taste just fine so i found that i enjoy my shakes with the on more and it is faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the on br br please do not get me wrong this is a great product but i just do not think it a higher price than the optimum nutrition protein br br so to as compared to a href http www amazon com gp product b optimum nutrition egg protein rich chocolate pound a br pros br lower in carbs br lower in fat br br cons br more expensive br harder to mix ,very good but expensive and , not as good as you are
had the of putting in my mouth br br i mix my protein shakes with a hand blender so i rarely have any mixing problems and even this protein mixed well the fun really began when i tasted it it tastes sour and acrid at the same time absolutely horrendous i could not finish the shake i had mixed up and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before i could actually eat or drink anything else br br this is a terrible protein powder from the of taste in my opinion of all the types i have tried which is many this has taken seat as the new worst one br br fyi i had ordered this with another brand because i am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity if anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation pm me ,a protein powder to make you , great product
i have tried a number of protein powders over the years most problems i encountered ranged from poor taste to not mixing well to leaving me bloated the healthy n fit egg protein is only calories and you get grams of protein with no cholesterol no fat no carbs minimal sodium in the big of things and even some potassium add to that the fact that it mixes really well and tastes good either on it is own or mixed with fruit i do not feel bloated with this at all like i did with other products like milk light i usually throw a banana and some blueberries into a blender with one serving of the protein for breakfast and then i use it straight right after a good workout again it tastes great on it is own or mixed with fruit i strongly recommend this product ,great product , good for you
there vanilla and chocolate are both delicious i would stay away from strawberry it has a strange artificial taste to it this was the updated formula too so they still have not worked it out i prefer to mix with some vanilla coconut milk and it is actually something i look forward to drinking as opposed to some that i had just down as quickly as i could i have also mixed in a teaspoon of cinnamon with just water and the vanilla protein and it is good as well br br another plus is that it uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners such as sucralose or aspartame br br if you cannot handle whey casein protein then i would absolutely recommend this one even if you can but want to try something else best bang for your buck compared to other egg proteins and the taste is actually good ,best natural protein , good but not as good as it is
it mixes well i bought a sample case just to test the waters and i dont feel bloated or anything after i drink it i think i feel my body is to it very well i am going to finish up the milk protein because i bought it and i pay over for it lol but when i finish up the other proteins i purchase i am going to stick with egg white protein since i dont like eating them everyone taste buds is different some may like it some may dont then depending on your body chemistry some well to egg whites some dont but as for me personally i like it so far might try out the strawberry passion protein but the vanilla kind taste very good i would suggest this protein should be used for or people who are into such as push ups and pull ups ,taste actually good , not as good as i like
this egg protein is great br first off it is sweetened with stevia a natural herb and not some artificial sweetener like aspartame or sucralose br next it is very easy on the stomach even whey without lactose is a lot harder on my digestion system it seems br it tastes good mixes well and is a good value br i bought all flavors and found i prefer the vanilla br goes really well with some almond milk and blueberries br i m glad i have found a pure protein source that is dairy and soy free ,product , not as good as it is
i loved egg protein but i think their out of business this healthy n fit will substitute just fine ,its good , great product
i have learned not to expect a lot in that department it just taste like watered down chocolate to me i drink it with water or sometimes with rice milk because i need the extra calories on days that i cannot handle solid foods however on receiving the product it does contain soy how much i could not say as it was not listed on the i found it mentioned on the back of the label stating that it contained soy think i that right i have not been able to find out how much if someone could shed some light on that i would appreciate the info also i noticed that it has gone up about since i placed my order last month so it may not be an issue anymore because that puts it about even with what i was paying for the jay robb egg white shakes ,seems to soy , not bad but not as good as it is
excellent product great taste and easy to in cereal etc that is it in a very timely delivery ,excellent product , great product
although it is very high in protein i thought the vanilla ice cream flavor was very bland i would not buy this again as it was not tasty enough ,protein , not as good as
well i have tried many protein shakes and the taste is never been a problem for me but this was just horrible it is good for you but i just could not do it it might be a good protein shake but it is extremely salty i tried to drink it with other liquids to help the taste but every time it tasted worse and worse too bad because i was looking to see some results ,horrible taste , not as good as it is
so after comparing this to jay robb i can say that this protein is not as good the taste is not as good and it does not mix that easy i do not think it is horrible just not that good br br one thing i like about the jay robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs i sent healty n fit an email asking where they get their eggs from but they did not reply it is a little cheaper but i found the jay robb at vitamin shoppe for per ozs which is not bad i have to say that i do not like the picture on the bottle but that is my only complaint ,not the best , not as good as it is
the protein powder is ok not to good as i expected if you pour hot milk over it will will form substance like egg white which is very bad in taste not at all drinkable ,not good , not as good as it is
fantastic product keeps fresh for months had a bag in my desk that i had opened but packet was product still fresh after several weeks product has a spicy but not hot flavor and is enjoyed by my whole family i am diabetic and have a hard time finding low sodium low calorie snacks grandpa po products are both low sodium low calorie and also taste great i would highly recommend ,out grandpa po products , great product
grandpa po originals slightly spicy is a wonderful savory organic snack not too spicy at first and ends with a great finish if i had to sum it up in one word it would be wow i would recommend them for young and old alike ,slightly spicy are slightly addicting , great snack
for years i have grown my own to dry crush and use for cooking i have been unable to do so for the last two years because of a job my supply from previous years had run out so i purchased this product to re supply br br i have been tremendously satisfied great quality great consistency great heat good color good size good price br br without any would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for a good habanero powder br br be warned though it is not for the faint of heart ,everything i expected , great product
initially i was worried about loss of when thinking about a powdered pepper this came out beautiful though it is very finely ground much like cayenne pepper is commonly found the color is beautiful br br i am very happy with this habanero powder i am so glad gourmet was there to provide such a wonderful product and ship it out so fast if you want some habanero for up your food buy this it is great ,beautiful powder , not as good as it is
hot full of great for jerky sauces love it ,full of flavor , great hot chocolate
been buying ground habanero from american spice for years decided to try someone else with their price going up up up and not satisfied with consistency of heat this stuff had the right flavor and more heat than anything beside fresh it will make you sweat better price and value than any habanero experience in years of buying the stuff will buy from this vendor again ,sweet , great product
the product was better than expected and it arrived quickly i am very pleased with this purchase ,better than expected , good
smaller bottle it when into my nose and i had a five minute attack in fact every time i use it i do i stored the larger bottle in a plastic bag until i need to refill and plan to wash the outside of the smaller bottle after each use so no one else in the house gets hurt br br with pets and please watch out for your animals that try to your food off your table it could hurt them and send them to the vet and watch out for with a bad sense of it could hurt someone badly if they decide to play a joke on someone with this pepper seriously br br also i guess i really am bad a math this size will last me a lifetime it is a very great tasting pepper smoky flavored if you can get past the hot part ,but i love the product , good but not great
i have previously brought habanero powder from a gourmet store at the grove in la it was roughly oz for this has the same great flavor and intensity that a habanero powder should have we use it to season fried fish and chicken and all meat dishes i highly recommend buying this product ,great buy , great for
knew that when i bought this years ago that i was also getting something good for my health saw a recent dr oz show with and he had a great recipe and one of the ingredients was dried red pepper by the way the recipe is just as good without the tuna i sprinkle a little of my habanero powder as a substitute for the red pepper flakes br br you do not need much of the powder it is very good quality if you see it you probably used to much i put some of the powder on almost anything the best part i had no idea i was buying a life time supply after years i think i have barely used a tenth my family makes a little fun of me about that but i do not mind i love it the powder and the very highly recommended ,a little hot spice to help , good but not great
i especially like like this on a href http www amazon com gp product b organics kale mega green oz g a i empty the kale into a container sprinkle on habanero powder put a lid on it and then turn it over and over to mix the two wow i have heard it is great with popcorn too whatever you do just be careful how much powder you use i have been in a world of spicey hurt more than once ,great quality absolutely delicious and hot , great product
this stuff is the bomb br there is no pepper that has a tastier fruity flavor than the habanero the fact that is hot is both a bonus for us heat lovers and a for the br i use this stuff all the time sprinkle it on a sandwich over the tomato sprinkle it over some mexican sour cream for a dip sprinkle on pizza or a cucumber and tomato salad the uses are near endless br br also if you wanted to use it in lieu of or pepper spray a little bit of this stuff blown onto any skin location rapidly excitement br be careful in the sprinkling of this stuff if you get a puff of it into your nose you will most definately know about it p ,a pepper powder , not as good as it is
this stuff is gold for the hot spicy food i put it on most everything other than breakfast grape nuts i really think you get way more value from this than any hot sauce in a bottle this is basically what is in that fancy bottle hot sauce just without a fancy label try it oz goes a long way ,simply amazing , best hot cocoa ever
my mom was born in england and i have been drinking tea since i was very young a few years ago i was forced to switch to decaf tea most of the blends available are terrible i used to drink regular tea and was thrilled to discover they had a decaf blend and it is a strong full bodied tea and i love it i decided to purchase from amazon because i knew i could count on them as well as their outside vendors i was very pleased with the transaction and would purchase from them again ,terrific decaf tea , great tea
i just received my tea thanks for getting it out so quick i really appreciate the extra box i drink this tea every night br br ,i love my tea , great tea
i have used this product for over twenty years however it is br br no longer available in any of the local food markets in the br br ca area i am happy that i can order it via br br amazon com ,blend coffee , great product
i ordered this candy for a friend as a mother day gift she was delighted to receive it and i was excited to share it ,delicious addictive treat , great product
i was to try this thanks to amazon new add on program cod pasta is surprisingly good especially with the toasted i used grams of angel hair pasta with one packet of the sauce next time i may reduce the amount of pasta or use two packets of sauce to up the flavor a dash of red pepper might be good too ,surprised , great product
i used this product cod spaghetti sauce to eat when i feel lazy at japan br that very cheap and just boil pasta and mix this pouch because br i ate that product once a week in japan br br after i moved here america year ago i really miss some asian food because little expensive but br when i see picture i remind how good and excited because i bought this from amazon br br but taste little different i was disappointed too strong smell like a ocean br i throw garbage because i did not remember product of japan america br br i never ever buy this in america ,i do not think original one , not as good as it is
i am glad nail has become to be adult and not just for little girls i am not sure why it started out for adults and dove for little and now back up to where it is alright for all sizes of you can also use items from wooden and other places not usually on the same channel as beauty materials for and ,will know more when i actually use it first , not as good as it is
this is not as tall as they advertised but we kept it and we like it alot it is the shining star of our indoor bonsai collection just stunning like having a forest in your kitchen we have had it about months now and it is thriving ,great tree , great product
one of the few chicken jerky type treats out there that is made in the usa and is not made in china time and time again there are recalls for these types of treats that come from china do not buy treats made in china for your pets sure these are a tad more expensive but in the long run it will save you money by not having vet bills and save the health of your pet i call it kitty and dog candy they come running from any room in the house when they hear the bag open they love real meat treats ,premium made in the treats for dogs cats , my dog loves these
my cat is a picky eater but he got excited even before the bag was open i guess he smelled the meat and devours the treats the only downside is the size i understand this was a strip but i use them as regular bite size treats and therefore had to break them into bits by hand took me a while i wish amazon sold bite size roast chicken treats by this company i feel good about giving them to the cat as it seems most cat treats are loaded with bad stuff ,cat loves it but , cat cat food
packaging on these leaves something to be desired last shipment i received had out of boxes with the corners crushed and when i opened the first one and removed the bag there were a lot of broken biscotti i expect it will be the same for the other box that was damaged given that these are fairly fragile they should be given better protection from being crushed by the br br the biscotti themselves are tasty if a bit small i wish they were full sized or inches long instead of an inch and a half but as i live in a rural area where people think biscotti is a kind of biscuit these are a good second choice ,small but good poor packaging , not as good as i have
pan almond biscotti were a disappointment to me not because they were bad but because they could not come close to the great almond cookies at best they are low in calories also in almonds ,a disappointment , delicious
they have other flavors but the dogs favorite is still the original i wish they carried it in the local we go to purchase their other flavors ,dogs love it , my dog loves these
we love this sauce and are hunting around to find it and to introduce it to others sort of a wasabi mayonnaise and terrific on fish potatoes and many other things we re eager to discover more ,a great , great product
was quite pleased with the product arrived on time and wrapped well would buy again and again try it you will let it ,great buy , great product
i bought these for my husband because he occassionally likes a cup of coffee at home and it is a hassle to out the coffee maker and grinder when he only wants one cup and it is not everyday it also comes in handy when guests come over because we do not tend to keep coffee in the house br br each serving comes in a little pouch that you can easily into your pocket or travel bag the flavor was rich and at around a cup much cheaper than going to starbucks or anywhere else and grabbing a cup on the way to work br br it dissolves completely leaving no grit or residue he first tried it in a ounce mug and found it to be a little strong but was perfect in his ounce travel mug br br ,convenient and tasty , not as good as i have
i was absolutely amazed at how good this is in my opinion it is as good as fresh ground coffee beans brewed up while i only use when i am in a hurry or want one cup i would not be without it and i have never used instant before now ,the best , good coffee
i have been a fan of starbucks via since it was first introduced as a pregnant and now woman my caffeine intact is restricted to one cup of coffee a day i am lazy and not willing to go to the trouble to make a pot of coffee for just one cup so i switched to via i do not think i will ever go back i have tried all the via varieties including the decaf italian roast and the various flavor blends mocha vanilla etc this variety is one of my favorites it is not as bold as the italian or french roast varieties but it has a smoother and taste and will appeal to those who like a well balanced cup of coffee good work starbucks and keep the new varieties coming ,a smooth well cup of coffee , good coffee but not a great price
coins back a few people have electric coffee pots others use a french press and still others sneak out for the real thing br br now that i discovered the columbian via i have to my cup from all those noses that my cup i know there are directions on the pack however i now have my own ritual clean cup fill filtered water seconds in the microwave shake contents to bottom of pack rip the whole top off the pack with teeth pour pack in and watch stir for a few seconds add a tad of ice hope i can make it back to my desk before the cup br br i was never a fan of reconstituted coffee however i think it is the addition of the micro ground coffee that adds the edge necessary br br in any event you owe it to yourself to try it ,a to your , not for
cup coffee makes br pros br fast and convenient br taste great for an instant coffee it is not quite as good as fresh brewed but remarkably better than other instant coffee br cons br it is expensive so watch the price on amazon it will vary greatly over time i tell my wife we are not pay the full price people put the item in your cart and then if u have time check your cart daily for a while i do this for all amazon purchases since the price does really for most items for via i have found that watching it can save me or more on amazon the price of this item locally never changes much br it is not the same as good brewed coffee do not expect this to be the same as fresh brewed coffee all else constant i e filtered water etc ,great fast way to get good coffee , great coffee
as far as instant coffees go this one is amazingly good usually i have to use sugar with instant coffee as they generally taste really bitter not so with this one i can drink it straight and it tastes like real coffee br br while this will never fully replace brewed starbucks coffee for me it is still pretty good and i will be keeping it my desk at work ,amazing instant coffee , great coffee
this is not a coffee that i would drink on a regular basis my morning coffee is freshly ground however at work i occasionally want a cup in the afternoon and the folgers and maxwell house that my coworkers brew is undrinkable the price on this coffee is a bit high but the taste is better than any other instant coffee i have tried so i will keep getting it until i find something better and cheaper ,the best instant coffee i have found , good coffee but not a great price
while no instant coffee will ever taste as good as a freshly ground then brewed cup with filtered or spring water this is as good as it gets otherwise while pricey the packets are handy and convenient the directions are easy just add oz of hot water and stir and the taste is smooth i even got a bit of a caffeine buzz these instant blends are not as bold or strong as getting a regular cup of columbian or italian roast at a starbucks location but still a very good cup on the go i really like this instant coffee and will continue to purchase them ,best instant coffee on the market , best coffee ever
i use it when traveling or when i am in a hurry and do not have the time to grind my beans i was surprised by how much it tastes like drip ,best instant coffee i ever tasted , great product
i love this coffee it is easy to prepare one cup when you are wanting a great cup of coffee highly recommend i usually use one half of the package since i do not like my coffee real strong ,columbian , great coffee
i like this coffee it is much better than instant i keep some packs in my desk for those long afternoons and i also started carrying them when i go camping if i can go another cup of instant coffee from a jar i will be happy ,good coffee , great coffee
done a great job with this product br br when i first saw it on the shelves i thought starbucks instant for over a a serving yeah right but i decided to try it anyway and what do you know it really tastes great you really cannot tell much of a difference i suppose you could if you had them both side by side but the reality is this once you load down your coffee with foam cream flavoring and and you let it cool off a bit the two are almost identical very very little difference br br so i can make myself a tasty cup of starbucks at my own home with my own cup anytime i want it saves me from having to go down to starbucks and spend almost more the quality and flavor are good and the price is actually right br br i recommend ,not bad , not as good as i have
i am not a big fan of starbucks coffee but i have to say this one tastes the same as their house coffee they brew so that puts it on the highest shelf within instant coffee family by far it also has the br kick of a regular brewed coffee due to the of real coffee beans in it must have if you are on the go or have no coffee maker near you ,the best instant coffee you will ever find , not as good as i will
prepared as directed w oz of water it is very strong good tasting coffee not better than fresh colombian but very good for emergencies and to have on hand for some this might be strong so oz of water is more the kind my friends like a good colombian coffee on the go but i like my fresh ground and brewed stuff better i give them an a for effort finally someone is getting close to that point where i cannot tell it is not fresh brewed but not quite there yet i ordered it days ago and got it fast the best by date on mine is may th of this year rather quick to expire or this stock is old perhaps that is why it tastes instant ,best instant i have ever tasted but it is still instant best by date , not as good as i have
this is a great stand in when you cannot make it out to starbucks love having an instant version at home love love love it ,this tastes great , great coffee
i rarely drink instant coffee but sometimes go to rural india on medical trips outside of starbucks and large western style in all but not in rural india it is nearly impossible to get brewed coffee in india ask for coffee and you get instant everywhere in india except as noted anyway to get a coffee fix on the go i have tried the starbucks via packets and for instant coffee they are wonderful will not fool you into thinking you have got a good cup of brewed coffee but better than common western office coffee and much better than the instant served in rural india the starbucks packs cost cents to each and i was hoping the packs would be nearly as good at the price unfortunately not if you want something that reminds you of brewed coffee bite the and pay for the starbucks ,great compared to other instant coffees , not for me
i bought this as an experiment to try on a camping trip br after adding hot water there was a brief instant coffee taste but that was soon gone and i was left with a real good cup of coffee it is too expensive for my budget as a regular item but i will definitely include it on future camping trips and driving trips with stays at cheap ,pricey but good , not as good as it is
if you want a good cup of coffee and are rushed for time or your household is like mine and you are the only coffee drinker then you must give this a try i admit the price is a little high but for that occasional cup it is well worth it no bitter after taste like other ,instant coffee without the instant taste , not as good as it is
i tried the starbucks instant coffee not only does it taste like coffee but there is no after taste like you get with other instant coffees i give this thumbs up ,delightful coffee , great coffee
starbucks has once again proven it is the world best coffee company their new via instant coffee packets taste great and are portable which gets me through the day i highly recommend this to anyone who loves starbuck coffee ,as always , great coffee
via is much more like a real cup of coffee br br another advantage of via is that the packets are in cold or water so it is possible to mix yourself a glass of iced coffee right away rather than having to brew and then cool coffee first br br at about per cup it is certainly less expensive than fresh brewed starbucks coffee though it is still more expensive than brewing coffee at home using a drip maker french press or whatever other process you prefer but for when you are on the run or on the road it is quite a and enjoyable cup of coffee without too much muss and fuss i bring via packets with me when i travel for example and keep them on hand for when i am not in the mood or do not have the time to brew a whole pot ,quite a good cup of instant coffee , not bad but not great
i drink starbucks drip coffee the instant tastes just as good and is great when you do not want to make a whole pot friends could not believe they were drinking instant coffee ,great quick cup of coffee , great coffee
without this is the best instant coffee i have ever tasted i have consumed coffee in many different countries during over years of travel starbucks has created a with this product it is a bit expensive but well worth the cost ,best instant coffee anywhere , best coffee ever
after a slow start at our meeting of guests these coffee packets everyone ended up enjoying them ,start , great coffee
really very good taste is great no weird artificial taste no little grounds floating about this is not crunchy brown water but an actual cup of coffee i make it in the microwave and it is great get the pack for and it is less than cup ,real coffee , good flavor
great coffee for the one cup drinker or the especially great for travel where you have to pack it in your suit cases wonderful for overseas where us style coffees are hard to be found taste is very good ,great coffee , great coffee
it really is great instant at very first sip i thought i detected that instant aftertaste but as i continued i was more impressed i drink coffee black and am pretty particular about my java i do think this is a great product to take on the road to work etc could do without the starbucks though ,best instant coffee no , not as good as it is
i am a very picky coffee drinker i was so surprised at the flavor of the italian roast oz to oz of water is all you need i run the water through the one cup maker it is important to put the coffee in first and stir while hot water is coming through i guess you could just micro the water and pour it over the coffee in another mug great for home or travel we all know hotel coffee is br enjoy ,instant coffee what a surprise great , not as good as it is
money on your coffee bill a quality coffee press and a will do much better the packet order currently sells for on amazon without special offers or subscribe and save discounts that works out to per cup which is about what you would expect to pay in a standard vending machine hands down starbucks via tastes better than anything pouring out of a vending machine however each via stick produces an ounce cup of coffee so depending which size you normally order you might spend for ounces or for ounces br br at per ounce cup starbucks via sticks are the same price as a href http www amazon com gp product b m french press to go a which i also reviewed on amazon com i still recommend both brands as tasty and portable options over the freeze dried coffee sold in glass jars br br rating four stars ,in a is a and cup of , great for a great price
i thought i would be writing a review raving about this product sadly i am not br i would never use it for home use it tasted muddy and bitter i followed the directions i even made sure the water was hot but not boiling i would probably take it but that is it it is worth a try if you have not tasted it yet read some of the other neutral reviews it might help with expectations ,expected better , not as good as it is
coffee is good but i do not care for individual would rather have coffee in bags like their other coffee is packed ,instant coffee , good coffee
sell me more these things are the perfect breakfast no they are just perfect better price then the local grocery store and better selection ,more more more , good
sometimes i just want something hot for breakfast but do not want to cook anything this oatmeal pack is great and has my favorite flavors br br recommend it with milk with water is just too weak ,good , not as good as it is
all of these flavors are great and make for a filling and delicious breakfast i highly recommend purchasing this item ,very tasty breakfast , great snack
my kids have eaten oatmeal everyday since the weather turned cold it puts warmth and filling breakfast into their tummies these flavors were great they loved them i wish there had been more apple and less banana br br the subscription meant we always had oatmeal and it meant a lower price too so convenient now that winter is i just cancelled the subscription and done ,oatmeal makes for winter , good for you
are you sick of the regular flavors plain apples and cinnamon brown sugar br br yeah me too this really changes oatmeal up at least for me it did i have been eating oatmeal for some time and saw these flavors and figured how could i lose these new flavors are fantastic and i cannot recommend them enough if you think their too strong you could always mix two packets like me and use a plain with one of these i do not generally do that but i like to use up the plain packets i usually have left over from the other assortments i get ,an oatmeal of goodness , not as good as it is
this particular variety box contains of my very favorite types of instant oatmeal apple crisp cinnamon roll banana bread ,instant oatmeal favorites , great product
this sounded so tasty from the reviews and the flavors were so i ordered some we had some for breakfast today and then went to pack the other boxes in bags to go to the shelter to us it is it has the texture of paste and not even palatable for us am throwing out the box we opened and my order on subscribe and save when you consider how easy it is to make real oatmeal i am sorry i was fooled by these flavors ,sorry for oatmeal , great product
this is a great marinade for any kind of meat i use it also in stir fry or fried rice a href http www amazon com gp product b garlic sesame marinade glaze sauce a ,great sauce , great product
i had this cheese during the summer on a hiking trip through the french we were able to go to a small producer and watch its preparation it is really delicious better than to which it is often compared when oh when can i get it in the u s ,when can i get in the u , great taste
we love jamaican me crazy coffee it is smooth and rich with a hint of vanilla and caramel this is whole bean so you do have to have a coffee grinder but totally worth it ,wonderful coffee , great coffee
joy coconut milk offers a tempting price lower than its competitors there is a good reason for its low price by all accounts it tastes like half the visible amount is coconut milk the rest being water br neither good for pina or cooking this is a poor value and i cannot recommend it to anyone ,you get what you for , not as good as it is
this stuff really works i love it and cant get enough it tastes amazing highly recommend trying it you wont be disappointed ,works and tastes great , great product
taste especially when very cold within minutes i do feel more relaxed and my mind stops i am a nurse and sometimes after a crazy hour it is hard to turn my brain off and sleep i keep situations in my mind and have a hard time relaxing this drink helps quiet my thoughts enough that i can fall asleep the only reason i did not give it stars is because i usually have to get up in the night to use the bathroom after drinking a oz drink before bed i do fall right back to sleep though so i do not feel like my sleep is will definitely keep this in the fridge for the end of a day i love that it is sweetened with splenda and not also it is a nice calorie free alternative to wine or beer for that end of day night cap ,definitely on , i love it
i do not drink soda and have no interest in energy drinks i love coffee however i enjoy chamomile tea before bed this calming beverage is a great alternative to tea especially in hot weather i will be ordering more wish it were available locally ,is delicious , great taste
i have a very lifestyle and need time to relax i have always had trouble sleeping as my head is i have tried lots of methods to try and sleep well but nothing has worked i saw this product in my local walmart and thought what the heck i will try it br br wow why could they not have brought this product out years ago after about minutes my mind was able to let go and relax and i had the best nights sleep in a long time the taste is awesome and it does not feel overwhelming like other products br br i am ordering more to stock up my fridge just great ,amazing drink my problem , not as good as it is
my wife and i ordered cans of the sugar free koma unwind i must admit i was skeptical but i thought i would give it a try boy was i amazed by the refreshing flavor but more importantly how i felt about minutes or so after drinking a can of koma unwind i slept like a baby i just placed another order today for more i plan to give some to my friends who have trouble sleeping what a great concept by koma i will be a customer for life ,not what i expected , not as good as it is
i was skeptical at first but not anymore did it is job and i slept like a baby great taste and product works wonders very relaxing ,great product , not as good as it is
i love koma it tastes great it works and the sugar free version tastes exactly like the original to me i just ordered my third case ,i love , great product
i was at a walmart in south carolina and just picked some up i was traveling and it helped me unwind ,awesome , great product
bought a case to see what it was about i am a night which effects my day to day performance and father related after a can i do feel mellow and finding myself going to bed much earlier ,good taste and , not as good as it
after minutes you do feel alot more relaxed reminded my of smoking a certain item when i was younger tastes great to boot ,going into a , great product
this is a very good tea as far as teabags go loose tea is always better quality than teabag teas but this is the exception being organic as well as the least processed compared to other teas white tea is the least processed of all teas teabags a subtle paper flavor that loose teas are free of these bags are a cut above other teas the subtle teabag flavor is less of a factor in this instance and are an excellent choice in of saving money it took about six weeks to finally get delivered but it was worth the weight this one is a no brainer ,this tea should get the , great tea
wait for it to steep and it is really good for you i just love the taste of this but then again i enjoy the bitter flavor of but this is not bitter it is yummy for those who do not know is considered to be ginseng for women it is very high in vit b and helps to keep women from becoming due the their monthly cycle it also is said to help periods when used on a daily basis that said this tea is special because it helps to draw one energy and the red date adds to this effect in that red is the color of the st in other words this tea has qualities and will create feelings when taken before bed and it is good for you and it tastes good and it is a snap to make so what is there to be about ,a special this one , not bad
from crisp and delicious to overpowering and slightly off putting i guess i attribute that to the freshness of the tea i am not sure i have had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas while this tastes good when you get it right if you forget the cup for a few minutes it is not that said that is the only real drawback to this tea yes i have had teas i would rate five stars six if i could yes they also cost x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea bottom line if you drink a lot of tea this is a good brand to buy if you do not drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it i would look elsewhere ,after at least a year this tea some , not bad
this tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor the bags come individually wrapped in foil packets it fast and the resulting mug of tea is and aromatic i love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so the one thing i think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags i am usually not a fan of stevia to me it has a bitter aftertaste but it was not overwhelming here ,good tea very , not as good as it is
purchased this tea because of recommendation product arrived well packaged and quickly i am very pleased with this product and will purchase it again ,tea , great tea
i have tried this product before and i really love it the price is fair and i enjoy it ,it is a good product , great product
is astringent properties but we that with milk or cranberry juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered good both hot or iced looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the prince of peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable i hope they do not up the price just because everyone else white tea is higher i wish it was available in a loose tea too a smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas i had as a child and at chinese restaurants beats anything i can buy in local supermarkets br br i did try the organic version and no way this one is better for some reason stronger and overall a better product even the bag it self is better than the organic ,good tea wish it came in loose tea too , not bad
the tea is good and fresh we enjoy it the shipping is fast and cost is reasonable br i recommend this product ,good tea , great tea
you get enough in each package to make a good size cup of drink it is consistent in its flavor and the amount you get in each packet i have purchased it a couple of times ,nice product , good
if you do not have the time to cut up ginger and boil it for it is wonderful flavor here is an alternative this tea is refreshing true ginger flavor and punch is wonderful ,great tea , great tea
gold prince has made a terrible mistake there are two products coldaid and fluaid they are different unfortunately they display fluaid picture on the amazon website and their own website but the words are coldaid there is a separate product for coldaid regardless if you order the fluaid on amazon you will get the coldaid the picture is not the product the words under the drop down menu are worthless as they all to the same product coldaid if you want fluaid which is the superior product do not buy it from amazon or off of the sellers website it is a mistake http www amazon com gp product b p uk ref cm cr prod title ,wrong product wrong name , not as good as it is
i found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket for one box of opposed to boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting i would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea i am not a expert and i am looking for something as authentic as i can get without paying an arm and a leg can anyone suggest a good quality the only reason i gave this a is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of ,bought at my local , great product
i used around the word tea because i doubt that the bags contain tea i would not be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea i would not give this product a single star it deserves zero stars in my opinion br this tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star ,the worst tea i have ever tried , not as good as it is
other line br br if you cat is like smoky where he much prefers cat food with gravy on it so that he licks through it and gets his meat with it as well plus if you cat likes the smaller of food like my cat does then your cat should really like the marinated br br there have been times i have tried to switch to difference brands but if the pieces of meat or fish are large for him he will only up the gravy the marinated are his favorite br br i keep waiting for my to start talking to me so i can understand his food choices as well as his on life but until then smokey and the others cats that i have had have seemed to to me pretty darn well as what they want and have all trained me very well br br ,i got the that is all my cat will eat , cat cat cat food
these guys are quite high on the nutritional scale but on these marinated morsels varieties well they hate them they get stuck in my cats teeth and although it can be quite watching them afterwards it just ins t worth them only eating about half a can and tossing the rest down the garbage i recommend them for the nutritional value and please try them if you cat loves chicken my rescue loves many of the other varieties and this stuff has improved her quality of life tremendously recommend ,great nutrition , my cat loves these
my used these and loved the fresh taste of the tomatoes said it was like she had just picked them a garden ,wine country , great taste
i love the fact that this is multi grain baby food but like people food good for you things never taste great so mix it with bananas or some other fruit yes the texture is a bit difficult to swallow for little ones hence why you want to thin it out i read the other reviews and cannot believe they never thought to mix this food with something else ,must mix it with fruit or other tasty baby food , great food
we love this vegetable pouch for our month old and more importantly she likes it too i like that it has sort of a dry texture compared to basic blended vegetables i stir a touch of milk into it each time and it makes it really creamy she always finishes it and its one of our favorites ,like this texture and tastes good , great product
my son has been eating the multi grain super greens with gusto from when he was months old he likes it cold or warm yes it is quite plain tasting to our grown up but in my opinion great for the little ones i started putting some cracked pepper and herbs on it more recently sometimes i serve it as a snack sometimes as a side dish to meatballs or chicken highly recommended ,my son at still loves this one , great product
my month old would mush this around in her mouth and not swallow it there isnt much she doesnt like but she sure doesnt like this stuff it looks like a weird mushy green stuff i am sure it is super healthy but she didnt like it at all ,healthy but my baby eat it , not as good as it is
the grains make this food really it just does not stick together and was falling off the spoon a major mess really it also does not have a zip lock top and i thought it did like many of the other pouch foods and took this with us out to dinner i ended up putting the leftovers in a plastic baggie my baby also was not a fan of this at all and she is not a picky eater even my dogs turned their nose up at it and i thought it tasted pretty nasty ,weird texture , not as good as it is
it is more of a side dish than a main dish cook in some chili beans and peppers then it is more of a meal it also made a very good taco salad it was also good as filling with some extra cheese this is a good starting point to let your imagination make good great the expiration date on mine was good for a year well into ,good , not as good as it is
i made this last night for dinner it was very good i substituted the cheese topping they provide with real cheese and then used the as filling it made burritos inch so it goes a long way br br if you like spicy stuff it is a little bland but that is expected with boxed meals on the other hand if you do not like spicy then it is a little hot so that could go either way br br as a side note there is not much meat in this so if you are wanting lots of hamburger you would be better off with something else ,very good and inexpensive , not as good as it is
three stars as just food br br wrap a tortilla around some or eat it plain it makes an interesting and fairly good filling meal i have no idea why somebody would toss it it just is not that bad folks not the greatest in the world but not at all bad either but then if you hate chewing a taco then you may not like it br br personally i prefer the and love the chicken and biscuits i have ordered the so we will see about that however these are all easy meals for a decent price i am a retired guy living along so they are great for me probably a nice idea for a college student or two for anyone a nice package to have around for a busy day feeds two hungry folks three normal folks a bit skimpy for four unless they are dieting ,ok but not as good as other , not as good as i like
sent this to my mother to help her out with groceries since she is on a fixed she said it was horrible and would be throwing the other boxes out so i would not reccomend this product ,bad product , great product
have roasted and peeled all my life since i have less time and energy now i ordered these in a jar already peeled tried lots of different ones and found these to be the most tasteful and clean and fresh ,best ever , great product
this is one of two licorice mints that i would recommend they are indeed difficult to find and at this time amazon does not carry my other favorite st nonetheless has beneficial herbs and a mild but definite licorice flavor not one of the licorice flavored gummy candies two or three of these little hard and you are done no black tongue either treat yourself and indulge in these little gems ,if you love licorice , delicious
the s they put a new on the by making butterfinger those were good but they really themselves when they invented the butterfinger crisp the butterfinger crisp is made of baked wafers layers of butterfinger flavored cream then the whole thing is wrapped in chocolate br br yeah this candy bar is great a real improvement on the original it has that same great butterfinger taste but without that stick to teeth consistency if anything it even tastes better the normal sized butterfinger crisp contains calories but a nice thing is that it comes in the form of two bars which allows you to eat one as a roughly calorie snack and save the other one for tomorrow snack i wish that they did that with other candy bars br br anyway if you like or if you like wafer candy then you will like butterfinger crisps go for it ,go for it , good for a great price
butterfinger is so good its like eating a really fresh butterfinger i order online because i had a hard time finding them in the stores if you like you will like butterfinger crisp a light not to heavy on your stomach ,a crisp way to eat , good
all of my girls from the black lab and pomeranian love these treats i love them because i can disguise any of the dogs meds in them and they will still eat it great ,love these , great for
all of us like to give treats to our pets but some of them are just too high in fat or too calorie laden my dog was just diagnosed with diabetes and our vet suggested we use these chicken bits as her treats instead of the normal milk bone type biscuits they are very low in fat and high in protein very chewy and my dog just loves them i wish the treats were a bit larger for my lab so i end up giving her two if you have a smaller dog they also make these treats in a smaller size also these are just the right size to use as treats if you are training your dog ,healthy treat , my dog loves these
lean treats for big dogs is a great product and loves them and yes this was the best price and it was shipped on time tom ,treats for dogs oz pack , my dog loves these
my dog absolutely loves these treats he is a very picky eater and this is the only treat he will eat the fact that they are pretty healthy makes me very happy ,dog treats , my dog loves these
when a store started carrying wellness products this was one of them i purchased a bag and my cats loved it i went back to the store to buy more and guess what they were sold out this was almost a year ago they still have not this product because their corporate computers do all the ordering for them and not an actual human that knows what sells and what doesn t needless to say this store is a chain pet supply store and well they have since lost a lot of local business from me alone as i have found that i can purchase the same product for much less via amazon and also get it in as little as a few days ,great cat treat that is good for them , great product
although a little pricey these are a great way to give your cat a healthy treat my cat has a sensitive stomach and cant always eat the treats i have gotten for him without him throwing up i stopped using grocery store treats and moved to natural balance but they were too much for his tummy but these treats he absolutley loves and he never gets sick afterwards also with the all natural ingredients i feel good about rewarding him br p s since they are natural ingredients they are stinky like salmon ,great healthy cat treats , my cat loves these
i have cats and none of them really like these treats they will eat them eventually but the certainly do not go wild for them i do like that grain and chicken free so they are good for cats with allergies ,okay , my cat loves these
i really wanted my yr old cat to like these treats because i already feed her wellness wet food which is excellent by itself perhaps she is too used to the whiskas temptations that i normally give her but she did not like the jerky bits at all i did notice it was hard for her to pick up because they are pretty flat and the texture is than what she is used to the rd time i gave her the treats she vomited it out looks like it is back to the less healthy alternative ,not for my cat , my cat loves these
sure if these treats contribute but they could we love the fact that they do not have corn wheat soy or a bunch of other stuff she really does not need we also used these treats as a training incentive to teach her to sit for a treat it worked people laugh but now we call her and hold up the bag and she looks up at her treat and sits down if you do not give it to her right away she walks closer and sits again smart kitty and she loves those treats this is the first flavor we tried but have since tried others and she loves them all br br if you would like to try something more natural for your kitty i would give these a go we have been more than pleased and these are now the only treats we consider buying for her ,recommended and we agree natural is the best , great
my cat absolutely loves these things the only downside to them is that they will dry out after a while other than that they are great healthy cat snacks ,my cat loves these , cat cat food
my three year old persian mix absolutely adores these she does not like any other treats these are perfect because they are chewy so they feel and taste different from her food she does tricks for them and always comes running when we bring them out definitely try them they are healthy grain free and perfect for any kitty to the comment about the bag just buy a treat jar works much better and it looks on your shelf or counter ,best treats out there , my dog loves these
i have discovered the wellness brand of cat food and i and my cat adore it i only wish it were easier to afford still amazon seems to either match petsmart or have a better deal these treats they only matched the price but i like amazon br br when i open the drawer that these are stored in comes running she would tear the bag open and eat them all if i were to accidentally leave it out she loves these treats br br i am glad that i can spoil my cat with healthy treats food like the wellness brand i highly recommend these treats although as long as they remain you might want to first purchase from a local pet store to make sure your cat likes them ,my cat me for these , my cat loves these
i bought these for my cat and if i give them to him he will eat them but it is not the type of treat he will do tricks for or run over to eat it is a healthier alternative to other treats but i would not buy them again because my main point of buying treats is to train my cat to do tricks or reward him for good these treats simply do not him enough to really be a treat ,healthy but not really tasty , my cat loves these
the ingredients are good and my cat loves it she is never walked away from it so i was very surprised when my son cats did i decided to rate it from my cat point of view ,this is the one for , cat cat cat food
this product is really a hit or miss my cat does not seem to go crazy over these treats sometimes he does not eat these right away ,my cat them , my cat loves them
i have cats one will eat anything the other one is soooo picky she is had to have some of her teeth removed due to a mouth so i needed to find some good soft treats she likes these more than anything i have tried they are really thing little tiny strips i like wellness all natural products both cats like their brand cat food as well ,great soft little treats for your , my cat loves these
on the first offer my ferret did not want the treat but a couple of days later i noticed him trying to steal the whole bag so i offered a piece again this time and ever since he is loved it go figure br br i like this treat for because the pieces are sized ie small for a ferret and the ingredients and are superior to most ferret treats his digestion has been less affected by these than by many ferret treats also ,great for too , good for you
great natural treat for my cat whose health i want to keep strong for many years and he loves them ,my cat loves em , my cat loves these
i got these for my kitten and he loves them br br the comment made about the bag being hard to open is not really that big of a deal i have not had any problems closing or opening properly though i would much prefer a container type packaging since those are easier to get into especially if you are training a cat you do not want to hold a bunch of cat treats in your hand because the bag keeps closing on you but the bag closes opens like any other zip lock br br i feed my kitten chicken flavored cat food so i try and the treats with a different meat and wellness salmon treats work great and it is healthy without all those fillers br br this review is for the treat not the bag so i highly recommended this stars ,old loves these , my cat loves these
my cat seems to really like these as one reviewer said they will dry out if the bag is not sealed i have not had any problems with sealing the bag that i purchased ,real jerky , cat grass
i liked that these treats did not have anything gross in them i e corn wheat soy by products my cats do not really care for salmon but i thought since it was mixed with turkey which they love they might like them well they didn t they took one sniff and wanted nothing to do with them though my inside cats did not want them the cats outside loved them ,my did not care for them , great product
my cats loved the treats but everytime i try to use the bags zipper to close it up i gotta with it for a while just to close the bag eventually the bag did not close properly and all the treats dried out causing the cats to lose interest i plan to buy another but this time i will dump it in my own container ,the food is great but the bag , my cat loves it
i bought one of these bones for my lab shepard mix pound dog and she loved it i bought the first one from petco and the large size was dollars amazon is over cheaper and there is free shipping before committing to bones you can do what i did and head on over to your local pet shop to see if they carry these bones and then see if your dog likes them it takes my lab about hour to eat the whole bone i really like that it breaks into small pieces which my worries about my dog choking on a big piece of bone ,my dog loves these , my dog loves these
i have a month old that loved the busy bone treat he has some anxiety and they can help keep him calm it takes him about minutes to eat but it is long enough for him to calm himself down i just make sure he keeps it off white stuff the red center a little if he drops the wet side down or a piece gets broken off and falls on a light surface my dog will chew on one end then leave it if he gets then come back and chew on the other end and the wet side surface he is on i have been able to clean it out of stuff easily enough but it is a little bit of a annoying that i have to i also wish they were cheaper ,ok product but , great product
about fifteen minutes since i would given the dog the bone deeply absorbed in with myself for not rinsing said dishes i was when an awful sound met my ears a terrible and familiar crunching noise the dog was eating my bed so i go into the to her and even before i get a chance to look at the bed frame i am struck by the mess she has caused the busy bone somehow leaves little brown crumbles all over the floor too small and numerous to pick up by hand and too for the vacuum cleaner to clean up the has to be washed out of the carpet with a dish and did i mention that they are expensive br i will continue to stick with real bones that i purchase from the butcher they are cheaper they last longer and they do not leave a terrible mess ,expensive messy and quick , good product but
my dog her busy bone in under minutes i think she basically ate it which was a huge disappointment we were hoping for something that we could give her that she would enjoy but also something that would last a bit longer in addition to being more of a treat than a chew these things are messy she had it all over the floor around her and all over her paws it makes a sticky goop that is not very easy to clean up i definitely will not buy these again it is too expensive to only last minutes ,not very , my dog loves these
i like the busy bones my pit has to work at it a bit harder than she does some of other large bones on the market i do wish it would last a little longer she can finish one in under minutes i am giving it to her because i want her to be busy not for minutes ,almost stars , great taste
i buy this as a special treat it lasts about an hour and my large dog really enjoys it ,treat about an , great product
our german short goes crazy for these bones they are big tough and it takes our pound dog a good hour to chew through this ,gone wild , great product
this quality product is my dogs favorite healthy chew treat they enjoy the purina busy bone immensely they prefer this treat to rawhide chews and do not quit on the purina busy bone until it is finished ,dog treat my favorite , my dog loves these
other dogs but has now left its mark in lori and my life we will never be able to the painful into our of her lying still on the floor i lie awake at night thinking about it now as well as remembering digging her in our backyard through such that even i a cannot express in words it is now the closest we can get to our special friend we are utterly greta only years old healthy and in her prime a wonderful loving companion is gone forever it is a horrid loss that cannot be replaced thanks to purina br the very least purina can do is pull all forms of the busy bone from the market immediately and to conduct adequate responsible research in the future before releasing any purina product br br and lori br former owners of beloved greta female pug our baby gone forever ,a product for your dog , i love it
bought these for my two dogs one and english and the other a black mouth i thought it might keep them occupied for at least an hour as other reviewers had stated well of course my dogs had to be different minutes flat all chewed and gone i might add both of my dogs are aggressive and that is the reason i went looking for something that would last for other dogs who chew normally it may well last for an hour or so br br they both love these bones and this packaging is a great buy i will continue to buy and give as a weekend treat for my boys ,great buy but , great product
we have ordered from this twice the first time we received it next day and were very happy the second time it arrived next day as well but two of the cans had opened and the box got wet causing the inside of the box to be covered in clumps of spoiled formula when we used one of the unopened cans we had to since we had nothing else to feed the baby and this product is not sold in stores the baby became sick for several days ,damaged formula , great product
overpriced beans they are packed in a glass tube that is not air tight br br the beans were thin and almost dry br br get the cheaper options at amazon instead they are much better and way cheaper ,poor quality beans , good
very tasty i used it for years they recently added more red peppers and that is makes it more spicy that i prefer but it still very good ,excellent seasoning , great taste
we were unable to find this in any of our supermarkets since april finally decided to order it service was fast and product was what we were looking for for any of you who have never tried this it makes beef better than any chinese restaurant ,best ever , great taste
this product is excellent tried it one night for a quick easy dinner and the whole family loved it including my very fussy year old daughter well worth trying for yourself ,excellent flavor , great taste
this seasoning is easy to use and delicious i recommend you add some sliced mushrooms too it is a great addition served with brown rice and broccoli it is a favorite at our house ,love it , great taste
i love this seasoning and actually bought it on amazon after searching everywhere to find it after the store i use to buy it from closed i use this seasoning with chicken too ,great seasoning , great product
i bought this once at my local grocer and it was so good i went back to get more and it was gone i asked the store to get it again and they never did so found it at amazon placing my second order today since i am down to my last pack ,great beef mix , great product
this was the first time i have made beef my son suggested it he had it at a friend house so with our next chinese dinner i like to make all my own foods we made this it was a tad spicy for me perhaps i needed to add more beef or a little water will definitely make again by the way you can buy the seasoning packet at wal mart br br ,very good beef , not as good as it is
this is a simple and delicious i have made this several times just add beef and spring onions it is really delicious tastes almost like the beef we order from china bistro one of my favorites and so easy too ,taste is authentic , delicious
when i lived in germany i bought this all the time over there the biggest problem was of course everything was written in german since you have a computer just go to a website and in the instructions and have them changed to english from there you can use the product ,problem , not as good as it is
i had used this frequently on and off over the years and did not realize that it is not sold in the us any longer in the past the instructions were in english on the packet but i do not recall what they were now it is entirely in german and no one i know a word of the language i do not have a so one of the suggested will not work do not buy before realizing that if you do not speak german and have no one to you are in a pickle i have packs now another thing all packs expire in months time so do not buy in bulk unless you plan to eat a lot of rated only because i am unable to use the product and the product description does not mention either the language issue or the near term expiration date ,read before buying , not as good as it is
i recently invited a baby mini doxie into my family and had an lb chihuahua that the vet constantly told me to try and up i would try hamburger and cottage cheese and all the things he told me and she would either get a tummy ache or just not gain weight i bought this food with the doxie in mind and fed it to the chihuahua too and she started to gain weight within the week i now have to watch the portions i give her or she will over gain two healthy dogs with the help of this food when the doxie gets older i will continue to buy the eukanuba adult brand ,keeps the healthy , great for
i now know why so many people recommended this brand the quality is amazing and you can tell the difference in substance compared to other dog foods even the organic type ,my dog is so healthy , my dog loves it
since i have not been able to eat fat there are many things that i miss eating tortillas were something i ate alot and really missed you would never know that these are fat free the only complaint that i have is that the tortillas stick together and i have torn many of them i would say that in the big picture i would rather have a torn tortilla that no tortilla at all i plan to reorder when i run out ,yummy , good but not great
the fat free la flour tortillas are great when i can find them br wal mart is supposed to carry them in my local stores but they don t br so i turned to amazon and now they do not have them either ,as , great product
one of the best mass produced teas i have tried light keemun flavour delicious with or without milk and can sit in the pot without tasting a great bargain in the pack ,delicious , delicious
i had tried this tea in bags before i prefer leaf tea when the local shop ran out of irish breakfast tea i tried this instead very good flavor that recalls uk trips i would recommend this tea to anyone ,real tea , great tea
a delicious strong black tea with enough flavor to stand up to milk and sugar might take some getting used to if you do not usually drink black tea but for the it is one of the best ,my favorite tea , great tea
as a fan of english irish breakfast teas i found this tea to be very weak flavored if you like milder weaker teas this may be for you but if you like more robust flavors steer clear of this one ,very weak tea , not as good as it is
this is my new favorite tea it is absolutely delicious and even after it is sat and gotten cold it is good i am not a fan of milk in my tea but i will drink this without sugar no problem it has a naturally creamy flavor fantastic tea ,love this tea , great tea
i ordered these as a gift in june they tasted great they did not arrive in picture perfect condition due to the heat but i was contacted by the company to see what they could do for me the strength of a company is not found in things that go correctly but rather in the things that go wrong and what they do about them i would recommend them highly ,very tasty , not as good as it is
they were shipped in ice that is pretty cool they arrived in the summer texas heat without even the slightest hint of melting ,well shipped loved by all , not as good as
simply splendid chocolate covered cherry perhaps the best we have found i went to their web site and found a large assortment of other chocolates and ordered more from there they shipped quickly ordered december rd arrived the th the candy was slightly melted who would expect degree heat on december th oh yeah fort worth texas however my wife loved them ,excellent in every way , great stuff
my wife is very fond of chocolate covered cherries and has tried just about every brand she me that these are the very best she is ever eaten ,chocolate heaven , great taste
grams br sugars gram br protein grams br since beluga black lentils are said to have a higher protein content grams per serving you can see that these small black lentils are different from beluga br i was glad to see that nice blue label on the website for heirloom beluga lentils glad to learn about them and would like to order them what i received from this was small black lentils not beluga instead of i received vegetarian organic black lentils not that i am sorry about it the can label has a wonderful recipe for soup and a vegetarian diet pyramid for nutrition these small black organic lentils are delicious and i recommend them to you to try and i would like an opportunity to order and try the heirloom beluga lentils as well sometime you will like the small organic black lentils many ways to serve them ,these little taste terrific are organic , not as good as the price
my dog loves greenies and did not notice the switch from the regular to the lite she loves them either way ,my dog loves these , my dog loves them
this product is very healthy for your body it is cost effective because is not mixed with other things it comes with a little spoon with the right for your drinks i bought it in and i want to find it in the us is better than other stevia products i have bought in the past ,great product , great taste
taste is much superior to the regular freeze dried that you get in the supermarket i would bet you will enjoy the taste as much as we do ,coffee , not as good as it
i love cherry soda but this product is the best cherry soda that i have ever tasted sweet and slightly tart at one and the same time try it once and you will be hooked for good ,the best cherry soda ever , great taste
in the winter when fresh blueberries exceed our food budget these dried blue berries are fine for muffins breads and p we also enjoy fruit on our cereal in the winter it is often oatmeal and we sprinkle these blueberries on a bowl of oatmeal wonderful on a cold morning ,best , great product
was pleasantly surprised at how good these pretzels were there are servings per bag at calories each this is about to pretzels the pretzels are really filling the bag has approximately pretzels i was expecting them to be bland since they are made with natural ingredients but they are very flavorful made in the usa is a big plus ,really good , good but not great
these are delicious with just the right touch of mustard and a nice crunch i would definitely consider buying them again the bags are generously filled too ,yummy for the tummy , great snack
five gum is a new product from wrigley i am always on the lookout for new gum since i like having something to chew while i am driving i came across this back in august and was pleasantly surprised the flavor lasts a really long time and is relatively strong ,gum on the market , best ever
zen brews up to an golden amber liquor the aroma is sweet spearmint the blending of this tea is excellent spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor then you taste a hint of lemon the green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the impression of zesty spearmint and lemon into a substantial very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste br br remember that this tea does have caffeine however it does not say how much on the box a good might be mg compared to mg for the average cup of coffee make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter four minutes is ample ,and lemon are by green tea into a , not as good as i have
light sweet and oh so good is how i would describe this tea i first had it at a hotel at the breakfast and loved it so much i went to amazon and ordered more that same day ,my favorite tea , great taste
this passion tea is used at starbucks we mix it with two lipton tea bags for iced tea really good fruity flavor great for summer ,delicious tea , great tea
the vendor is fast and dependable the tea is simply the best way to relax and great tasting too highly recommend ,daily , great tea
this tea is amazing i drink it iced with sugar and lime it will blow your mind the taste is similar to a flavor of kool aid that i had as a child i can just drink glass after glass of this tea ,addicted , not as good as it is
sharp orange flavor with a tolerable spearmint taste i have tried many of the less expensive brands and have not liked any other except this one and good seasons tuscany i am not crazy about all of the tazo drinks but this one is nice i love drinking this tea with chocolate it comes in an orange package you can also smell the other spices do not make the mistake i make by adding too much water as with many products amazon is over charging ,good orange flavor , not as good as it is
i had a difficult time trying to find aluminum free baking soda and finally found it on amazon it was shipped quickly and the seller put in several free samples of natural beverage mixes which i really appreciated and will use very pleased with this product ,aluminum free baking soda , great product
i was real happy to find this no stores in my area carry it nor does my health food store i feel better knowing this is aluminum free i basically use it to maintain a ph of around works perfect ,aluminum free baking soda , great product
i bought this baking soda to clean my teeth times a week they say that teeth become noticeably br but you have to to be very gentle while brushing and use soft type tooth brush i did notice a difference br br also i noticed that when baking soda was mixed with water the ph indicator showed the highest level almost on the br this may explain why baking soda is so effective to fight br br it a good product ,aluminum free baking soda , not as good as it is
arm hammer baking soda is aluminum free they just do not write it on their packaging br br i was not sure so i called them and they said there is no aluminum in it and they would have to state it if there was because people take the product this leads me to believe that there just is not aluminum in baking soda and researching it showed me that there might have been in the past but not anymore and not for a long time br br i that bob red mill aluminum free on their package and then charges a premium for their product it is also arsenic free i hope if they label it arsenic free will we assume other brands aren t i do not like that kind of marketing ,they are all aluminum free , not as good as it is
just to clear things up no brand of baking soda contains aluminum some baking powders do so check these labels but not baking soda the benefits of this brand vs a h for example is the way in which they are bob is naturally so this baking soda is in it is natural state yay a h on the other hand uses chemicals during it is process so yes bob is more natural no you do not have to worry about aluminum when buying any brand of baking soda this label is just a marketing for shame check out ,no baking aluminum , not as good as it is
bob red mill baking soda is an excellent product for baking with or making your own br it is aluminum free and free of any other harmful chemicals we use it as a safe legal product br on the specific carbohydrate diet in healing my boys with and healing my own br as we have difficulty our body of harmful toxins in foods ,baking soda , great product
all baking soda is aluminum free this is an unnecessary marketing ploy to get you to buy their product buy this because it is naturally and is free but do not be into thinking that good ole arm hammer has aluminum in it btw the chemical process used to make a h is almost exactly what occurs in nature just faster but not cheaper it costs no more to mine sodium than it does to manufacture so yes you are paying for a name ,all baking soda is aluminum free , great product
i have been using this product to increase my ph score after a bout of ta state bladder cancer there is no aftertaste and it leaves me with a clean feeling delivery from amazon vendor in kentucky was slow ,product , not as good as it is
working to reduce m my body d ph helping to reduce the effects of my using twice a day first in the morning last at night mixing with a half a lemon and oz of filtered water seems to be helping ,seems to be my , great product
br best to use a funnel and pour the heated stirred mixture into a clean plastic milk bottle this makes re mixing by shaking easier br br i measure my ph at least twice daily prior to taking each dose using the urine test strips purchased through amazon made by these strips will also measure one ph by testing probably more accurate at the moment tested as the urine may have over a period of hours a combination of high ph and possibly a current ph level the goal is to maintain an ph level br br see br br the is not a member of the medical this account is not to be as a recommendation to in the therapy described nor to its as a treatment for any disease one must decide for one self upon any course of to be taken with regard to any medical condition ,five star , great product
okay so i bought this product and then had to laugh upon further research that all baking soda is aluminum free it is baking powder that has aluminum in it the cheapest baking soda you can find is still aluminum free it is still good baking soda though and kudos to the bob red mill marketing department you guys are ,it is baking soda , not as good as it is
i really like bob red mill products this item came promptly and is perfect for my baking needs i totally recommend it ,love bob red mill products , great taste
i got this product for consumption i took some of the store bought baking soda and did not know it is loaded with aluminum so glad i was able to find this product thru amazon and after reading all the positive reviews i got it and started taking some with a glass of water great product fast delivery great price very happy with my purchase ,fast shipping great price , great product
i just called bob red mill and talked to a representative there i was told that the packaging has been changed and no longer states aluminum free but natural it would be helpful if amazon clearly stated that the packaging has been changed by bob red mill so that one will not be ordering bob red mill aluminum free baking soda when this is no longer an item it would save wasted time by customers who are trying to what was sent when it appears that a name change took place it would also spare vendors from receiving less than excellent reviews ,aluminum free natural bob red mill baking soda , not as good as it is
all i can say is that it give me peace of mind knowing that i am not ingesting aluminum br can t tell any difference same taste as the regular arm hammer ,of , not as good as it is
this is a wonderful product but it comes in a paper bag which is easy to puncture and when you ship it in a box with no bubble wrap it around a lot and you start to get leakage of the product powder everywhere i would order it again if i was sure it would be packaged right so it would not be around in the box ,the item is great shipping was not , great product
great product and nice taste glad they sell it online not sure where to buy it in the local supermarket it was a decent price i just thought that the shipping fee of seemed high but the product seems great ,great product they it in local , great product
i was very unhappy when this package arrived at my the bags were not wrapped for and was damage in route when i opened the box the baking soda was all over the place i could not where the many holes were and did not have to a container to put them in so i threw it away i made a mess all over the place what a waste i will not be ordering from this company again ,disapointed , great product
real salt is good and good for you doesnt take much to flavor foods with this product try it for yourself today ,real salt , delicious
purchased three pounds arrived well packaged am trying to find a replacement roaster of this blend this is good but not great we ll keep on looking ,just o k , good coffee
this is the best coffee i have ever tasted and at a reasonable price outstanding coffee thanks coffee bean direct ,great coffee , best coffee ever
this coffee has a taste so good and so distinctive great aftertaste and low acid are welcome additions to it the best i have ever bought on amazon ,like a of a great wine , great coffee
you do not know until you have tried it for yourself having enjoyed peaberry coffee i think the shape results in better roasting from many different parts of the world i gave this a shot based on the positive reviews posted and the great price boy was i disappointed the beans are light medium in roast has a mild subdued smell the beans looked dry but this is not for light roasts i made a fine grind of the beans and brewed it in a press sad to say it was the most disappointing cup of coffee i have had in a long time the flavor was stale without any fruity characteristic of and reminded me of a cheap cup of joe from a dirty diner the worst part is i am stuck with lbs of terrible coffee that cannot be returned amazon does not accept return of food items ,very disappointed , not as good as i be
these beans are my favorite for making espresso i get the most amazing crema from them especially when i grind them frozen and store them in the freezer we have tried quite a few different kinds of beans but we stopped looking after we found this one using a baby espresso machine ,great for espresso , great for
the beans were old and not well cared for or if that is just the way tanzanian peaberry beans roast up not sure how a manufacturer gets away without putting a date on their products but this supplier has found some way to get around it the coffee does taste good although a hint of exists but the beans are totally dry no oil no moisture is present when they are ground i have enjoyed peaberry coffees from hawaii for years are the best of the best beans i have also come to enjoy african coffees for their full yet mild taste so to find peaberry coffee from at such a great price was too much to pass up i expect to finish up the coffee i have purchased but probably would not buy it again or buy any coffee from this supplier since i have no of its freshness ,good flavor but dry beans , not for me
i agree with one of the previous posts coffee is a matter of personal taste my wife and i really liked this coffee it was fresh and flavorful if you like dark roasts do not buy this one it is definitely not dark the flavor is very distinct and pleasant as opposed to some and blue mountain blends we have tried before ,the best i bought on amazon so far , good coffee
i rarely post a product review but i feel that i would be as a consumer if i did not comment on the peaberry whole coffee beans i had high hopes when purchasing this coffee and i did my best to tolerate them to i have consumed almost one whole bag of the three but will have to dump the other two in the trash the beans are stale dry over roasted with little flavor even loading up the coffee with sugar does not seem to help i resolved that this morning would be my last cup i will have to resort to buying the eight of the clock brand at my local grocery store i even briefly considered giving the two unopened bags to a friend but decided that it was not worth him coffee bean direct you need to do better much better ,awful , not as good as i have
the coffee was not stale as some have had but the roast is too dark for a bean such as this i believe a better product could be had with the same beans ,too dark , good coffee
we had found some other peaberry coffee previously which had a really interesting rich flavor to us for some reason this brand just tasted flat to us by comparison the search for the perfect peaberry coffee continues ,kind of bland , best coffee ever
i purchased this coffee because my subscription hawaiian peaberry coffee was wiped out due to unusual weather and in hawaii while these peaberry beans are smaller than the kona they have a much more full bodied taste there were hints of cocoa bean and something else i could not put my finger on it is also about less that what i pay for the kona coffee gotta love it ,great cup o , good coffee
coffee green mountain price eventually became higher than i thought reasonable an internet led me to a small family owned and family operated roaster in their beans were also light to medium and thus had a dry appearance that level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts when the roaster computer system and online sales were temporarily i did another internet search and found amazon tanzanian peaberry roasted by coffee bean direct it has essentially the same good taste as the tanzanian peaberry from the roaster and the price is lower i am totally satisfied with the beans roasted by coffee bean direct and the shipping by amazon is quick enough that buying three pounds at a time allows me to place my next order before the current one runs out ,good price for a good coffee , good for you
i was in love from the moment i opened a bag and took the first however it did take me a while to figure out the right brewing method because i found it was much easier to might be just me though first i boil the water but whereas usually i just let it sit there for about a minute to cool here i actually poured it into a pot and let it sit for about or minutes then i grind the beans medium coarse it smells heavenly and tablespoons into the french press it goes pour the water in and i let it sit for a bit longer than usual too still hot though i find that it has a very nice sort of crunchy hard sugar finish to it kind of tastes like the top of a cr me brulee delicious i drink it black ,beautiful coffee , not as good as it is
this is really good coffee good enough to make me buy a burr grinder to grind it to the i like without having to watch the old one i have always liked peaberry generally speaking and this one is a really really nice peaberry full flavor low acid smooth kinda luscious actually br the only reason i did not go to five stars is that i have had a better peaberry but it was nowhere near this price i hope this price stays where it is ,five stars , good coffee
i tried this pricey dog food for my shepherd on the advice of a friend who has a small dog does that does very well on one of their foods for toy dogs first of all making a decision on what food to buy is confusing they have many breed specific foods and to look at all the bags is with the help of a sales i picked the medium breed adult my dog at first did like the food very much but i felt he was by the amount of food i had to feed to maintain his caloric need and gradually he lost interest in eating it the ingredients list was pretty standard but did have nice levels of antioxidants and omega oils certainly this was not worth the price tag ,not the of dog food , my dog loves it
we usually have fresh lemon grass tea at our local zen center it is extremely easy to make put a few blades of lemon grass in a pot to steep and you will get a fantastic tasting tea br br this tea is here is a fine replacement for when you cannot get fresh lemon grass lemon grass has many health benefits it is said to the liver and can lower acid levels this is important if you have br br because you get such a large quantity here on amazon it should last you quite a while caffeine free and light it makes a very refreshing afternoon tea br br give it a try br br thank you for reading my review ,great tasting tea , great tea
i have a lemongrass plant in my i make tea from it but i wanted convenient tea bags to take to work or drink whenever i wanted the tea from this box tastes exactly the same it is some of the best tea i have ever tasted i prefer to drink it hot but it can be made cold it is such a relaxing beverage i can drink it before bed because it has no caffeine i highly recommend this tea ,and delicious , not as good as it is
bought this product to give to a family member who lives cross country and is going thru treatment for cancer lemongrass tea is supposed to help with side effects of and i tried it as well have had other products containing lemongrass tea that tasted better still good value for the price and could probably be mixed with other teas to improve taste ,good value but not a great taste , great tea
this is a good tea that has a nice flavor my only complaint is that for a rich tea you have to use extra tea bags this is sold in bulk which helps off set the price for using more tea bags ,good flavor , great tea
a pack of on any of horizon flavors cost about this is ridiculously expensive but the product itself is excellent ,expensive , not as good as it is
these individually packed milk is great for on the road does not need to be stored in the frig this item came in packs of then shipped in its original box and then another amazon box over it the content was securely packed and i was not worried that the milk got dirty during shipping the price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle the only reason that i did not give it stars is because of the expiration date it is which is not too far away i just bought one from target because i forgot to bring one and my toddler was and it has an expiration date of sept overall i would still recommend to buy from amazon ,great packaging decent price ok date , not as good as it is
regular reduced fat milk from horizon received slightly over a month away from the expiration date my was to buy whole milk but the product description is confusing i sent an email to the customer support no response after weeks i checked and found that they made the picture larger good but left the product description without change br as for me it is crazy expensive shipping while i can get same fat free or reduced fat milk at or market basket the difficult thing is to find whole milk funny that whole milk as natural product became i guess too many people are concerned about becoming overweight ,organic plain organic milk ounce pack of , not as good as i be
i love milk only organic milk horizon is my favorite these little cartons are great for on the go if not opened can be does not spoil long as not opened great for on the go packing for a trip ,plain organic milk , great product
i bought this for a trip and it was so wonderful that i am planning to buy more it is a good way to keep your kids well fed with good quality organic milk even if you are not home ,great on the go milk , great product
it is the standard horizon milk in small packages that you do not have to refrigerate br br the only reason i buy this is i bake and i hate being halfway through a recipe and i am out of milk with these packages i throw it in the back of the cupboard and it is there when i need it obviously i use fresh when i have it br br i suppose the main market for this is kid lunches where you do not want to worry about it would be fine for that although it is about the most expensive way to buy milk and the price of for this today is twice what i paid and is currently twice that from other sellers on amazon so check around br br they also show reduced fat milk but shipped me the low fat ,ok but expensive , great product
i love this product tazo has produced a mild yet sweet and spicy tea that i can only call magic sweet cinnamon spice has a flavor all on it is own and i highly recommend it for spice tea drinkers looking for that perfect balance ,excellent tea , great tea
once again i find myself trying to like tazo herbal teas but they keep putting licorice in teas where is just does not seem to to me anyway this is another example where i expected a lovely flavored tea and the licorice flavor is so strong it is just about all i can taste i guess i will just give up on tazo who ever blends all their teas has different taste buds than mine ,for licorice lovers only , not as good as it is
delicious flavorful tea a must for cinnamon lovers it also has a pleasant sweetness that even those of us who do not use sweeteners can enjoy wonderful as a hot drink but i especially like it as a cold drink ,if you like , great taste
i love this tea and i hate that it is so hard to find i am so glad it is available on amazon ,this tea should not be so hard to find , great tea
this tea is perfect for me i have many food allergies and associated diet restrictions so i cannot have regular tea and many herbal teas this is a good tasting alternative to plain chamomile which was previously my only option for tea i love it it is hard to find at stores and was previously sold out here so i am glad to see it is back ,love this tea , great tea
this tea was not what i expected i love cinnamon tea and was very disappointed with this product the tea does not have a strong cinnamon flavor which i enjoy this tea has a stronger rooibos flavor than cinnamon flavor furthermore i found that the product description does not give a full list of the tea ingredients br br the ingredients listed on the box include cinnamon licorice root orange peel indian chicory root rooibos natural flavors star anise almond extract and extract ,very disappointing , not as good as i like
tazo sweet cinnamon spice tea is a very tasteful tea with no unpleasant after taste i am not sure what a person can say about tea but this flavor is one of the best i have ever had it makes great hot tea or iced tea it is pleasant flavor is a treat all by itself and is excellent without any sweetener br br some teas leave a bitter or strange after taste but this tea does not every cup is very special even if you leave the tea bag in your cup for a long time it never gets bitter wonderful product a href http www amazon com gp product b e o tazo sweet cinnamon spice herbal infusion tea caffeine free count tea bags pack of a ,tea , great tea
i tried this first in a sampler pack and was immediately hooked i put a bit of sugar and honey in it and at that point its basically like drinking a cinnamon roll ,super delicious , delicious
i had ordered this tea as i have been on a cinnamon kick i enjoy it for it is smooth cinnamon flavor i shared it with my friends and they have made all sorts of positive comments on it i will probably be ordering more even though i thought it would be a long time having to order a case of it thanks amazon and tazo ,sweet tea , great tea
wow very weird taste i typically like all the ingredients but this mix just tastes wrong it is somewhat similar to tea but with a licorice aftertaste it is not so bad that i could not finish the first cup but not my cup of tea ,the reviews here i think most people would agree with me , not as good as it is
i ordered it times and never had a problem like the reviewer above and i gonna compare it with my fav brand crown prince later then i ll order it again delicious for making a tropical fish soup and more ,delicious canned no salt is good for health , good but not great
to try help center to get credit and get the correct item gone through in the help center of amazon to no avail until i found the toll free amazon phone number amazon llc confirmed they can not accept the return but will send the correct item promptly we shall see awaiting a replacement item br a minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon i am used to ordering br anyone want some tuna o well br br p s updated review sept th i finally got the ordered item partly because the amazon rep corrected it when i called in and sent it fast btw it cost me a toll call to canada to the company without a prompt reply that just added insult to injury well i was able to order from a different merchant through amazon thank you amazon for coming through ,nd order , not as good as i be
i purchased this product to black bear to the bait pile the product has no sweet smell as one would expect i have asked for a refund or exchange from the supplier no response ,no smell extract , not as good as it

i grew up in upstate ny where this stuff was born it is pretty much a regional favorite that just has not caught on yet and aside from here upstate ny is the only place to get it what you do is use the sauce to marinate cubes of chicken overnight then just grill them up slide em on a soft italian roll and add some mayo bam good eats i use this stuff at home in the dc area and i would highly recommend the marinade to anyone looking for a something different in their chicken ,amazing stuff , great product
i love this stuff my dad brought some home from his home town in new york love it great marinade we beef or cubes after letting them sit in marinade love it ,yummy , great product
i love chipotle back here in ma when i live now it was years before you could find any products with chipotle things are better now but i still have to chipotle things in ca and i was so off when would not let me take this stuff on the so i have been forced to order this stuff online for years of all my sauces though this one is my go to favorite and it is the roasted garlic it is a real sauce it adds a complexity to the sauce that is really just different but i love roasted garlic too so the best of two worlds combined i keep other hot sauces around for different ethnic foods but when i eat hummus which is a lot this is the one i reach for in the fridge ,two favorite food , best popcorn ever
this energy drink has worked for me i drink one in the morning for my drive to work and one before i work out at night grape is ok fruit punch is better ,good energy , the best
our cats just love this stuff they eat the ultra premium dry food and ocean fish canned food we have given them some of the other formulas and they would slowly eat them but they will not leave the ocean fish alone ,for , cat grass
tried this for the first time last night and really liked it it had a great taste good for when you want something but do not want to ruin your diet bought them in the grocer for i thought that was expensive hopefully i can find them cheaper elsewhere ,very good snack , great taste
find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended there is certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than by this the flower bloom is durable i put an pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea and the flower survived perfectly well without if anything the tea from the additional overnight brew served cold the flavor comes out even more if you are partial to iced tea br br the flower upon brewing is pretty nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that numi shows on their website and it is as likely to bloom as it is to flower right side up some of them even bloom upside down do not expect perfection and you will be pleased with it ,tastes more like a green than an , great tea
a classic pasta requires this beautiful and mild form of bacon and as with every other product i have purchased from them la has guanciale br br a little guanciale a bit but still tender some diced tomatoes a little a pinch of crushed red pepper and you are done the guanciale is the star and this guanciale really stands up served with pasta and you might as well be in ,perfect for so many things , not as good as it is

my cat has an iron stomach she can eat absolutely anything and everything and is always getting into my human food and has never thrown up i gave her of these treats and within minutes she was and throwing up all over my carpet i did not connect it at first but when i gave her the same treats the next day exact same reaction br br i have tried several different flavors of this same brand and she has had the same reaction if you are trying these with your cat for the st time only give them of them and just wait to see how they react before you give them anymore ,my kitty to , my cat loves these
both of my cats age threw up for an extended period after eating just of these into the trash they go not the cats the treats not sure what they were to but thought it would be good to let other cat parents know the risk ,both cats up for a long time , cat cat cat
my sweet little persian looks like she is dying she is been all night because of these treats how has this item not been recalled ,this stuff is cat , great product
my own personal experience so others do not make a mistake br br when i got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats i started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it then i noticed he would vomit occasionally it was only after closer inspection did i realize these treats are for cats months and older i am sure there is a reason for this they caused his vomiting i switched to a different temptations and he has not vomited since so keep in mind there is a reason they limit these to older cats they really are not kitten safe i only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him i can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package ,not safe for , great for you with or
my are correct i have been buying this treats for my kitty for years and suspected them all along to be the cause of him vomiting ironically i even bought the hairball ones to see if they would make him stop vomiting now is i stopped giving them to him as often and then him whenever i gave him any it soon became clear to me that he only vomits whenever i give him this treats sometimes he would vomit within minutes and other times he would vomit during the night or the next morning but if i give him this treats i am sure to be cleaning up throw up off my carpet soon after i think is a matter of allergy or sensitivity to one of the ingredients and they probably do not do anything to other cats but i am never buying this again for my kitty ,up treats , my dog loves them
you know i was searching the internet for the words temptations and vomit when i came across these reviews i was surprised to hear that i am not the only one who has had problems with this product within an hour of eating these treats my cat vomits for about minutes i did not realize it was the cause until the second time i fed them to her it is really bad because it does not cause the cat to throw up all at once it is like she can just vomit a little at a time and you are forced to follow her around cleaning up all the vomit or her in the bathroom which is horrible ,makes some cats , my dog loves them
have about right now and none have never had any problems with these treats to date i am sorry that others have maybe had problems but these are the most tastiest and healthy treats available i also love that they provide great dental care and control br br providing these treats i honestly feel that my vet bills will be less in the future with also providing treats that they absolutely love br br my mom and i pay the vet bills for any sick cats we love cats so far we have been with wonderful healthy and none have been diagnosed with feline aids or and we do and have them tested br br please give these treats a try they are awesome oh and also buy the large bags because it is actually saving you lots of money from buying the smaller bags you get about x the ,cats love them and they are healthy , my cat loves them
like many others on here my cat was vomiting within minutes of eating these tasty treats she really loves them however they do not love her back it took me about a week to put this product and my sick kitty together finally after a google search i came across these reviews i stopped giving her the treats and so far my cat has been vomit free buyer beware this might not happen with every cat so it may be wise to start slow with this product to see how your pet will react and build up slowly back to her greenies i go ,kitty , my cat loves these
it is amazing to see the even split on reviews i have a cat who was having the occasional hairball he loves these treats and has only had one hairball since shortly after starting these i could not be happier with the product br br i got them at walmart the current amazon seller seems to be a rip off ,worked for so far , my cat loves them
not only kept her clear she put much needed weight on after diagnosed with a chronic illness she has beaten i have read some of the other reviews as a former vet i do ask if your cat is vomiting please see your vet asap hairballs that are very bad can kill a cat ,my cat , my cat loves it
and they never vomit they wolf them down thought i think they are crunching they have not totally stopped their occasional hairball but it is rare perhaps they would completely solve it if i could afford to give them to them all the time only problem with this product is i would love to buy it in a larger bag if they just made one if your cat do not like em move on but definately worth a try if you want a treat that also helps with hairballs ,my cats love them , great product
loves these treat so much and they work very well for hairballs he has long hair and if he goes without these treats for a few days he is throwing up hairballs and driving me crazy begging for his treats i have been able to teach him to stay off of things by not giving him treats too i noticed that always chews them well so that may be the reason that some cats vomit ,for these treats , my favorite
my cat is very picky and this is the only hairball remedy that i can give him that he eats and it works i do not have a problem with him vomiting at all i give him about treats per day and you have to make sure that you are giving them on an empty stomach and the hairballs pass through his system he never spits them up i used to purchase them at the store but they stopped carrying this specific type and only sell the hairball tartar control combo ones now my cat hates them so happy to find these online ,the only product that helps my cat with , my cat loves these
as with most cats i have read about here both of mine these down without even the slightest tooth mark in them this can make them vomit so my trick is to snap them in two so then they have to chew them because of the edges im used to the since i have they have smaller than a regular tom does and these are not hard to snap at all they love the taste of these although i am not all that sure they really help with the does anything really help though i do recommend these because of the great taste but try them in two if your cat has trouble vomiting after gulping his her food ,nice treat make sure they them , great product
i was reminded of my mother cat when i read the comments about vomiting mom cat the whiskas temptations whole and resembles a if you inhaled your food you would vomit too with my kitties it is an entirely different story they love them they chew them they these are not a dietary supplement they are a treat i even managed to train my kitty to shake hands using temptations i will definately buy them again and again ,these are fabulous , my cat loves these
not exactly sure whether it really hairball issue because my short hair russian blue rarely vomits while my mixed medium hair vomits quite frequently regardless of the treat nevertheless my cats do love it greatly always to me whenever i grab it ,my cats love it , my cat loves it
i have fed my cats these treats the last days within minutes of eating them they are both throwing up i will be going back to the three dog bakery treats expensive but have never made my cats sick why is the company not to so many bad reviews ,sick cats , my cat loves these
my one year old cat ate a few of these and seemed two weeks later i gave him a large helping of these br and i thought he was going to die he laid around and would not eat or move for two days i will not feed him these br again same thing happened to my parent cat after eating the salmon variety ,cat and sick for two days , cat loves it
my sister gave her cats these and loved them so i got them for my cats our cats have been vomiting a lot lately and we it back to these treats google whiskas temptations recall they were recalled not too long ago and i do not know why they are still on shelves do not buy these they will make your cat sick and who know what else it is doing to their internal system please keep your cats away from this product ,health for cats , cat cat cat
i received my cat treats quickly and the product works very well the best part is that the cats love it so i do not have to force them to take their cure for hairballs ,good product good service , my cat loves it
just like the other reviewer my cat wants to eat these instead of his actual meals lol he is truly addicted i am glad they have this formula with the hairball control they have helped out so much and he rarely gets them anymore ,great treats , my cat loves these
my year old cat wants to skip meals all he wants is whiskas temptations he particularly loves the ones for hairball control he will find the place that they are stored and either knock then off a table or come to me put his paw on my hand and look me straight in the eye until i give him he likes nothing better that these treats got a good deal for them on line saved several dollars on bags ,my cat is addicted , my cat loves these
i have never written an amazon review before but this product was so horrible i had to would be buyers i can eat pretty much anything but i had to empty out both bottles it just tasted like colored sugar water very thin sickening sweet do not know if there was any onion flavoring the only reason i bought this is because i could not get vidalia onion dressing shipped in california so far the worst product i have purchased on amazon buyer beware unless you like sugar water then drink up blech ,sugar water , not as good as it is
bought it first at costco but they recently stopped stocking it my daughter loves dipping her carrots in this dressing instead of ranch dressing also great for salads ,great onion dressing , great product
fell in love with this dressing after trying and buying it at costco they do not carry it anymore so i am glad to find it here so much fuller tasting than average grocery store salad dressing brands yes it is sweet and a little tangy kind of thick we like it because it has no egg we just do not seem to get tired of it have not tried it as a marinade thought i better add our review since we appreciate the comments of others ,fabulous salad dressing , best ever
i like to baste this heavily over pork roast and serve extra on the side my family loves it ,great taste , great taste
we love anything with onions and this certainly is a great product flavor sweet and tangy delicious on so many things we have tried this on plain chicken and even hamburgers will be trying this on pork over the weekend great price i hope this will always be available through amazon ,absolutely delicious , delicious
not sure what anyone else uses this sauce for but we use it with our roast beef sandwiches and it is amazingly good also i use it for my roasted vegetables or roasted potatoes it is delicious as a coating with garlic powder rice flour and pepper it is sweet but not sickeningly so we love it ,love this sauce , great stuff
excellent product i use it almost every night used to be available through costco but they no longer handle it br i would recommend it to anyone ,great salad dressing , great
one day my husband and i were at costco they had the oak hill farms vidalia onion on the shelf i said wow this really looks good but i put it back on the shelf when we got to the check out stand there it was in the basket my husbands says it did look good now i need to tell you that my husband is not a salad person but he decided to try this salad dressing by the end of the month we had bottles of the salad dressing costco did not have it anymore so i would check on line every day until it was available and i ordered bottles do not want my husband to run out of that dressing again that is my story and it is the truth ,the best in the , good stuff
this is the best salad dressing delivered promptly and in quantities that will last a while no other vidalia onion dressing compares to that made by oak hill farms sometimes you can find it at costco but you can order it to your front door if they want even more orders they can cut down their shipping costs ,my favorite salad dressing , great product
vidalia onion dressing is one of my favorite salad dressings and oak hill farms beats the other brands hands down a great flavor and popular with my dinner guests i highly recommend it ,all i can say is yum , great product
i used this vidalia onion sauce as a bbq marinade try it by mixing it with pork medium onions half rings and oz of this onion sauce mix everything pork neck cubes onions and onion sauce in the mixing bowl and leave it in covered in the fridge for hours ,excellent as bbq , best stuff ever
i use this as my secret ingredient for pasta salad which is always a hit i also use it in chicken tuna and egg salad and have used it in eggs too i started using it also via costco and was very disappointed when they stopped carrying it i put in a request for them to start carrying it again and we will see what happens i am just very happy that i can still find it somewhere ,great for pasta salad , great product
we used to buy this item at warehouse but they quit carrying it br we really like vidalia onion and therefore looked for a place to buy it br thanks great product ,onion , great product
cannot find this or anything like it in our stores anymore good to know i can get it on here ,tasty , great taste
this will be great with all that i use it for br thanks linda ,onion , great product
if you like triscuit crackers then this is the healthy version with the same great taste and texture amazingly there is not much of a price difference oz for vs oz for to purchase the better quality cracker if the coupon offer is in effect then these crackers are also the price winner the only is since i think these are healthy i eat more of them at one time than i would normally of the other brand they are sooooo tasty w melted cheddar cheese on top or warmed crab dip enjoy ,back to whole , good but not great
i first purchased these crackers because they have no soy in them my daughter is allergic to soy and soy free crackers are very hard to find i bought them and to my amazement my picky husband also loves them he prefers them to all other similar crackers i purchased a large number of boxes which i keep hidden as they tend to disappear rather quickly ,better than the , good for you
i have bought three kinds of the back to nature crackers now i am so impressed by the brand and with my food allergy problem i was excited to find them i normally get the rounds which are terrific with my cheese so this time around i tried the crispy thins and the harvest whole wheat the harvest whole wheat closely resembles triscuits a good thing however i am disappointed they are so salty i would have strongly preferred less or no salt i am perplexed about why a supposed healthy cracker would be so salty so i will not be ordering this one again which is a bummer ,good but too salty for a healthy cracker , not as good as i be
healthy delicious and great for food allergies no soy corn etc only contains wheat safflower oil and salt ,highly recommended , delicious
whole wheat expeller pressed safflower oil sea salt natural added to preserve freshness br br as a big city who uses public trans i do not own a car i rely on amazon for certain essential groceries i pick them up at the ups store on my walk home from the train stop it is one of the main reasons i am a prime member br br i ll need to cancel my subscribe and save for this item i like to think amazon was not going to send the next delivery without me of the new price br br i can get triscuits anywhere for a box sometimes less the back to nature cracker is now a box br br it likely the pricing situation is out of their hands but i am so disappointed br br looks like i will be checking out the cracker selection at costco ,price in less than , delicious
it is very delicious and i love salty foods but i wish that contains olive oil instead of safflower oil ,delicious and salty , delicious
these taste just as good as triscuits in my opinion br i have not found them to be overly salty br i buy these as a cheaper alternative br br if you want to know the source of any of the ingredients you should ask the company soy is a natural ingredient i am not sure what the star review is about ,good crackers , good but not great
back to nature harvest whole crackers ounce boxes pack of my wife all time favorite crackers only available at supermarkets and perfectly delivered by the case by amazon ,back to whole crackers , great product
excellent choice for a high fiber cracker these taste great and like other back to nature items do not have all the undesirable ingredients you would like to avoid if necessary whole wheat safflower oil salt and vitamin e perfect ,these are so tasty , good but not great
i am not a huge fan of salt so take that warning with a grain of well you know for most people the salt on these is probably fine they stay crispy over long periods of storage even after the package has been opened and split into containers they are reasonably sturdy they pair well with all but the cheeses wouldn t put on them they pair great with unsalted pb just a great all around cracker to keep in the house they have become a staple of my diet and unlike every other cracker i have bought in bulk and there have been many they have not developed some weird off flavor due to over or the cracker becoming stale they still taste good like a simple cracker i will be ordering them again ,bit salty but excellent , great taste
my family loves the taste of these they are a bit high in sodium for my liking and for the price i wish they were organic i have purchased the heart to heart brand but they taste much and have a strange aftertaste compared to these crackers too bad because heart to heart has half the sodium ,very crunchy and tasty but not organic , delicious
very closely resembles a triscuit cracker except there is no soy and a bit lighter br br you will not be disappointed with the taste and texture it is a quality cracker br br enjoy ,tasty no soy cracker , not as good as it is
i love them my kids and i eat them a box at a time we have replaced chips and other bad for you snacks with these just wish they were organic ,better than , great chips
does anyone realize usually comes from soy i am still hunting for a cracker i do not have to make their website is about it is source ,is from soy , great product
i was very excited to get this then i had a cup i never made it thru the cup br it is so sweet it is sickening really now i have to find family to pawn this stuff onto br and christmas is a long way off lol ,way two sweet , great taste
my son has nut allergies and us made are not safe for him since early childhood now the british nestle co have made a treat for him thrilled to have his favorite and in dark great and quick service and delivery ,excellent , good for you
the o ring for the top does not seal properly with the pitcher and you have to the pitcher more than other to get adequate flow this makes the top fall off and the potential for all the contents to spill out i just lift the top up a little when i poor to this problem the glass is sturdy and the that holds it is sturdy i got some stuff in between the metal ring and glass which looked terrible but is easily disassembled to clean there is no stop for the screw so over during could break the glass ,top is loose and does not poor , not as good as it is
my cats love the food and it is on the happy list of companies that do not test on animals through the peta site peta org that is very ,good quality food , cat grass
it i have fed them the chicken and liver flavor and the seafood flavor so far and they seem to like both equally i find it a bit more expensive than i had hoped it would be but then again there is no waste and i consider that in itself a savings alone i am a firm believer in better ingredients and less fillers and allergens make for less poop less litter use fewer trips to the vet and an overall healthier cat br br update i have tried all the flavors on my cats and the chicken and liver seems to be the one they like the most they have now all the other flavors including the seafood flavor that they originally liked i also wanted to add that this is a very strong smelling brand of cat food almost overpowering when i open the cans at feeding time ,cats love it , cat cats
to finally find a food i am not afraid to feed my pets i have read about this food that state the meat used in it is a grade that can be consumed by humans that makes me feel much better about what my cats are eating br update br it been about a year since we started using this and our older cat is doing very well on it amazon was out of stock once when i needed to reorder so i purchased another organic brand not only did our older cat turn up his nose to the other brand but so did our other cats they would not eat the other kind so when pet was back in stock i ordered another case and the cats were happy kitties they all love this stuff i think it stinks but apparently that is part of the attraction for them ,nice to find product safe , cat cat cat cat cat food
i really wanted this food to work as it seems to have good ingredients for a decent price however my cats who are typically little do not even bother to check it out when offered so much for saving a couple of bucks now they eat organix ,good value cats do not like it , my cat loves it
i have been using this all natural cat food for a few years when i could afford it but did not think to shop where i buy my books with free shipping i only wish amazon offered a few more flavors since many commercial cat foods are made with grade d not fit for human consumption i am delighted to have this choice ,so so good so nutritious , cat grass
i have found this cat food to be the choice for both my cat with ibd and my cat with diabetes and miss c are thriving on this diet of turkey and brown rice and enjoy it so much more than prescription diets the price was great too for a premium cat food ,nothing but the best my cats , cat cat food
my cats love this food they always lick every last morsel of it i love it too because it is one of the best values for a high quality canned food ,cats love it , cat grass
i have three cats have had cats for years this food smells better than most my cats like it the ingredients appear to be better than the average cat food so far so good i will continue to use it for my cats ,cats to like this food nice to have it delivered , cat cat cat food
could not be happier of my cats love it the rd cat is a dry food addict and i am in the process of trying to convert her but it is slow going be warned though this stuff smells terrible opening a can and it out is like being in the face with a week old mackerel but that is how cats like it br br bottom line this food is reasonably priced and high quality it has low carbs low ash magnesium high protein real human grade meat with no by products the vitamins minerals are for better and petguard has stated they do not use bpa lined cans also contrary to what the ingredient list here on amazon says it does not contain sodium or at least the case i ordered does not have any listed so they must have stopped using it which is a big plus ,great quality food and my cats love it , cat cat food
my cats both love this food i have had varying success with about different kinds of canned food this one is a hit with both it is natural mostly organic does not have any junk or fillers and i have peace of mind knowing that we are giving them high quality food from an ethical company since they have been on this diet they are more active alert and happy their coats are so soft and shiny and they seem to be shedding less cannot say how relieved i am to have finally found a food they like that is so good for them as well it is pricey but if you want to save on costly vet bills down the road due to illness caused by poor nutrition this is the way to go ,quality delicious food for your cats , cat cat food
bought both the savory seafood and the chicken and wheat as the kittens liked the fish chicken and liver flavor they are not so fond of it but will eat if there is nothing else also they will only eat it as soon as a can is opened there is no hope of putting half a can in and feeding it to them later oh yeah and stinky but a good product if your kitty likes the taste ,will eat it as a last , not as good as it is
used for less then months both cats fur began falling out bad br stopped using it the cats fur is back to fine br back to feeding my cats nature variety instinct br i this product at fairway market not amazon br will not use it again ,cat loved it but their to out , cat cat cat food
i have cats on this food as well as the seafood this is their favorite but they will eat the seafood as well my old gentleman this year loves it and is doing very well on it quality ingredients for a fair price i do agree with the one reviewer who said the cans were all dented and hard to open mine have been the same with every shipment do not know if that is why the price is so good or not ,cats all love it great food for a good value , my cat loves it
i am giving this a solid because my old but healthy cat loves this stuff and it is good for him but i will tell you right now that this stuff looks and smells quite gross as long as i do not have to eat it it is all good ,as long as likes it , great product
the cats like this stuff pretty well for the health of our we keep them on an all canned food diet this is one of their favorite flavors i will admit that sometimes you can see bits of fish bone in the can but the food seems to be of high quality i wish amazon carry the organic versions of petguard canned food for cats ,it is cat food they eat it seems pretty healthy , cat cat food
what can i say it is cat food but without stuff in it cats should not be eating it is her favorite flavor but that depends on the cat ,the cat likes it i have not tried it , my cat loves it
i just got this and so far my finicky cat loves it br one of my friends recommended i try this for my cat as she has allergies br that we think are food allergies and so far nothing else has helped br friend cat no longer has allergies on this food and i hope the same for mine only time will tell br br addendum she still loves it but for plus in shipping which it now is i will be switching to something else ,so far loves it but , cat cat food
my cats love the food and it is on the list of companies that do not test on animals through the peta web site ,not on , cat grass
i felt really good about being a good cat mommy and buying something of such quality for my too bad none of the would eat it no matter what i did br br donated it to the local maybe a dog will eat it ,it would be nice it they ate it , not as good as it is
this is an excellent quality product i have a husky a breed which loves fish i have hard time finding fish in canned dog food so i feed this food to my cat and dog and they both love it it has rice flour but no rice in it my cat does not like the foods with rice but she loves this and peaches highly recommend this food ,great quality , my dog loves it
i used to order this product at per box of cans and now it turned into dollars how did it double out of nowhere ,what happened to the price , not as good as
i am a huge coffee drinker and love the k cups for making one cup quickly before leaving for work in the morning while there are many choices i prefer a bold strong coffee first thing in the morning wolfgang puck french roast is absolutely delicious strong and not at all bitter and makes a great first cup of coffee i would highly recommend to all bold coffee drinkers ,absolutely delicious coffee , great coffee
we always drink or emeril thought we would try something different not too many decafs to choose from we were pleasantly surprised that this had a great taste with a full bodied flavor i like my coffee on the milder side so i can even get cups from kcup ,yummy , not good
good subtle flavored coffee for the mid afternoon pick me up a bit of sweetness without being overdone wish it was available in whole bean as i like it stronger then the keurig cup can make it ,good stuff , good coffee
wolfgang puck chef reserve colombian dark roast is basically what they said it will be dark roast but not too strong acidity is on a low side but with plenty of pleasant taste at the same time you can drink this coffee black w o the need for the sweetener and or milk this coffee is in european tradition and will please many people i would recommend it after dinner but not if you need a jolt to wake you up ,what was , not as good as i have
they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee br br there now you know br br my mom goes for the extra only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over years now and she is frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck or rather mine since i buy it for her br br unfortunately out of all the extra bold k cups she is tried she claims that the wolfgang puck is the tasting she is tried it in both the medium small serving sizes format and both have produced less than full flavor drinks br br if you are looking for a rich flavorful strong tasting coffee try the a href http www amazon com gp product b hkzz a van houtte cafe medium roast extra bold coffee count k cups for keurig brewers pack of a ,my this was not as flavorful as other extra , great coffee
this coffee brews very weak like a light roast w p chef reserve pods are just over half full put pod on scale and it is less coffee than normal pods stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee ,weak even on small cup , good coffee
i wanted to like this coffee i did we have tried other wolfgang puck k cups and have been pleasantly surprised this just did not impress us bitter aftertaste and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor smells great while brewing but just does not live up to it in the cup i am really disappointed because i now have a box and a half of this product that we really do not want to drink great price though ,really disappointed , not as good as i be
i purchased these for my mom and she loves them she does not like bold coffee flavors but is more into the sweet and more flavorful varieties this one combines the taste of the islands with a smooth nutty flavor amazon had a great price on these and this is something that i can actually recommend ,drink the of , good for you
this is a good decaf coffee but i have never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup it is extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess ,great taste cup , great coffee
warning this is a strong flavor br br i thought that this would be blue mountain y oh no it is like rum flavored or something yuk ,if you want a flavored coffee okay but yuk , not as good as it is
i admit i do not usually drink decaf but this is a favorite in my office and i felt it deserved a good rating ,a favorite at the , good coffee
this wolfgang puck coffee tasted great the vanilla flavoring is just right some reviews said it was not so good not enough flavoring etc do not pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here i have never posted for a product and i have tried many different k cups this is a good k cup and do not hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback i almost hesitated and did not buy it and then i figured i would give it a shot it was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor you will enjoy it it tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor ,just right and you will love it , great coffee
i saw the good reviews of this jamaica me crazy coffee but the reviewers all seem to around whether it has coconut vanilla caramel rum or coffee flavorings br br first off i am not getting any coconut from it at all some vanilla but it mostly tastes like coffee with irish cream in it br br in fact after i drank a cup i had to go pick up my son from kindergarten and it occurred to me that some of the other parents might think i was drinking coffee while we waited for the class to let out br br but its good i recommend it to anyone who likes flavored coffee not really anything else like it and i have tried about different k cup flavors ,good coffee but up the flavors , good coffee but not a great price
with so many choices now i thought i give this a try br the donut shop decaf is by far my favorite and this one falls short ,not the best , not as good as it is
i used to do the subscribe and save with the timothy world kona but due to the fact that the price on timothy jumped so high i went to wolfgang puck breakfast in bed pleasantly surprised and i must say that i like this one much better than the kona it seems much more smoother but the taste still retains a nice warm mellow bold flavor great way to start the day oh and i love the name of this coffee ,very smooth not acidic , good coffee
what i usually buy so i thought i would try something new i normally drink coffee people donut shop which is a nice strong cup of coffee this was a little disappointing it is called a medium roast but when i brew a large cup my keurig has size options it looks like strong tea very light in color it makes a very weak cup of coffee when i brew the smallest cup possible it is a tiny bit better but i prefer a large cup of strong coffee think i may try the rodeo drive or sorrento but this one is just too weak and light for me oddly enough the first time i tried donut shop i thought it was too strong as i had been used to weaker coffees now that i have started drinking the stronger varieties it is hard to go back to brown water ,too mild for me , not bad
i was not expecting this one to be so rich or full yet it has a smoky finish that is typical of a french roast but does not taste burnt i think alot of times a french roast tastes thin and yet bitter instead of full and smoky but not this one very pleased with it and will definitely order again if you like a stronger cup in the morning without being bitter give this one a try ,a must have on my , not as good as it is
very good product but i need to use it the setting on my b to really enjoy the depth ,wolfgang puck columbian , great
as a french roast fan i bought this brand of k cup with high expectations considering the name attached to it i was disappointed it has a hearty aroma and full bodied flavor but leaves a bitter aftertaste br br if you are a lover of the more robust roasts i would recommend trying the a href http www amazon com gp product b l y a coffee people kona blend island style extra bold k cups for keurig brewers pack of a instead it is a smooth blend with none of the bitterness that delivers that kick you are likely looking for ,a strong yet bitter brew , not good
not too bold not too weak not bitter good way to start if your not into the real strong coffees my husband and i have added the wolfgang puck breakfast in bed line and the rodeo drive flavors to our buying ritual ,definitely a good breakfast , not good
this flavored k cup is not out of this world but is not horrible in my opinion it is way more flavorful than the wolfgang puck hazelnut k cup we love flavored coffee in our house and so i would go with this one again worth a try ,decent , not bad
never had hawaiian hazelnut before so i did not know what to expect but it turns out it is pretty good not as flavored as say dd but nonetheless pretty good i have it on subscription now along with the german chocolate cake another one of my favorite flavored k cups ,than expected , not as good as it is
this has made me into a coffee lover very mild and easy on the stomach but with a great flavor love it ,breakfast in bed coffee k cups , great coffee
nice light cup of coffee definitely not a bold brew but it is smooth and gentle on the stomach good for those mornings when you over did it the night before would buy again ,enjoyable cup of coffee , good coffee
this is a very balanced and smooth light coffee great for a first cup of the day ,smooth and light breakfast coffee , great coffee
this is a great cup of hazelnut coffee smooth and balanced with no chemical aftertaste my husband and i like it so much that we have ordered it twice directly from the keurig manufacturer so glad that it is now available on amazon through subscribe and save ,wonderful coffee , great coffee
i am amazed how many are being so easily fooled what you are seeing is a generic ingredient list that covers multiple coffees what it is saying based on the photo i see above is that if the coffee type you have is straight coffee then all it contains is arabica coffee but if what you are drinking is a flavored coffee then the ingredients in it are arabica coffee and flavorings but if what you are drinking is a decaf variety then it contains arabica coffee that has been decaffeinated with acetate as is standard br br so if you are not holding a decaf variety then there is no decaffeinated beans it is nothing more than generic catch all ingredients that apply to variety you happen to be looking at br br think people lol ,it is not decaf people , not as good as i like
nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored i am still not sure what flavor it is some type of nut i wrongly assumed that jamaican coffee would be similar to the blue mountain coffee which jamaica is known for how silly of me to assume that i hate flavored coffees so i was so disappointed to now own boxes of such a horrible coffee it only says flavored very small on the box so i did not notice it before i opened it hopefully i can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee flavored coffee for myself ,flavored coffee , not as good as i be
no where in the description does it mention that this is a flavored coffee by the name i thought it was a jamaican blue mountain blend but its flavored with a weak tasting hazelnut not very good ,misleading , not as good as it is
i was in a hurry and did not read the reviews i trusted amazon description and it did not indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was not jamaican it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad i feel cheated ,non flavored coffee beware , not as good as it is
i thought this was a jamaican blend or roast but turns out it is simply a heavily flavored coffee the flavor tastes artificial like fake maple syrup flavoring we have three coffee drinkers in our house and none of us could get past the first few sips now i have to find a home for the rest of it so it does not go to waste ,flavored not for us , not as good as i be
i wish amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be as such then folks who really dislike coffee this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee this stuff tastes the way i imagine newman own extra bold coffee would taste with spoiled irish cream dumped in it nasty shudder ,not at all just another sweet flavored coffee , not as good as it is
i drink about to cups of coffee every morning i am always looking for a new flavor so i gave it a try i drank it but i would not order again ,great name but i did not care for it , not as good as it is
i like strong but smooth coffee this coffee is strong enough but a little on the bitter side for my taste i have tasted other strong blends that i like much more my husband who likes a medium roast coffee is ok with this coffee but it not his favorite either i would only recommend it to someone who likes a little tang in their morning cup of joe ,good but not my favorite , good coffee but not a great price
now and i have tried lot of coffee during that time i have had an occasion k cup that did not function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds br br i probably should have returned these before i bothered to open the second box since i drink my coffee from a cup i can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks br br i have had to throw out at least cups of coffee its a bit like russian and i have started it after i brew it br br i know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the green mountain timothy or tully that i also use the good cups are a bit weak for my taste but the flavor is ok definitely prefer not to waste on a product with a manufacturing defect ,these k cups have issues coffee not bad , not bad but not bad
rodeo drive is my absolute favorite and i am ready to order more that is if i can find it br i do not know why they are discontinuing it br it arrived very fast ,rodeo drive is crazy good coffee , good coffee
honestly i have to admit that i expected a little better that is not to say that this is bad coffee in fact it is quite bold without being too acidic and pretty satisfying overall i think my main problem is that wolfgang puck name is attached to it so perhaps it set my expectations a little high i have a wolfgang puck knife set that i adore and is very high quality for what i paid for it this coffee was on sale so it was well worth it also i just hoped for something that would knock my socks off which it didn t i also purchased the breakfast blend and jamaica me crazy at the same time the breakfast blend was the best in my opinion and the jamaican coffee smelled the best but was the least successful ,good but not wolfgang puck good , good but not great
the breakfast in bed coffee from wolfgang puck is a good medium roast coffee my husband the regular coffee drinker of our house likes it but feels he would like the coffee more if it were a bit stronger the product arrived quite soon after ordering ,good coffee from amazon com , good coffee
i am not a gourmet coffee critic but this stuff is disappointing based upon previous good reviews i suspect that the coffee in the k cups i received is not the same they may have changed the manufacturing the wolfgang puck decaf i received is watery and tasteless there is no aroma when it is brewing in the keurig never again ,tasteless and watery , not as good as i be
the wolfgang puck coffee chef columbian decaf is fantastic and very delicious i definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a great cup of coffee ,wonderful k cups , great coffee
nice round flavor not harsh or i enjoy it with french vanilla creamer lately it has been harder to find i do hope they have not discontinued it ,my favorite of the k cups , good coffee
coffee tastes great but the cups get torn apart when brewing what a mess that is i am quite disappointed because i do like this flavor of coffee ,bad cups , good coffee
perhaps my expectations were too high when i see the name wolfgang puck i expect to be impressed this to my taste is very average tasting coffee to be fair it is billed as a medium roast and that is what it is however it is just too bland for my taste br br if you want decaf with more character try green mountain coffee dark magic decaf a href http www amazon com gp product b n i green mountain coffee decaf dark magic k cup portion pack for keurig brewers count a or emeril jazzed up decaf a href http www amazon com gp product b b y emeril jazzed up decaf k cups a they are darker roasts though so if you want a milder coffee the wolfgang puck might be what you are looking for ,disappointing , not as good as i be
this is my wife favorite she grew up in seattle and has consumed countless gallons of various types of coffee in her lifetime so i assume this is good coffee she is also my wine taster as her palate is much more sensitive than mine ,wolfgang puck k cup decaf , great coffee
i tried this product solely for the fact it has wolfgang name on it i should have stuck with timothy brand this was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee more like a dinner coffee i will not be buying this again also way too expensive compared to the others ,bitter taste , not as good as it is
love this coffee but cannot buy it through regular so am by corner really sticks in my paying more than a buck a cup ,wonderful coffee , great coffee
we were given a keurig for a wedding present along with several variety packs so far wolfgang puck jamaica me crazy is our favorite and we will definitely be repeat buyers of this flavor ,our favorite k cup yet , great coffee
this is my favorite late evening cup of coffee nice flavor just right before for the night keep stocking this brand and i will keep coming back for it ,my favorite , great coffee
it is a great flavor and makes a great cup of coffee i fine you can have more than cup of this coffee and not feel like it is too much of a flavored coffee puck has a great flavor with this coffee ,great flavor coffee , great coffee
it sure would be nice if they stated anywhere in the description of this coffee that it is flavored i love the bed and breakfast coffee it is just plain coffee so i was surprised when i received the jamaica coffee and it was flavored yuck ,beware flavored coffee , not good
i ordered boxes of each and opened one box to find they were pods and not br for keurig and i cannot return them yes the pods fit into the keurig but br the end product is weak and awful i am most disappointed ,so disappointing , great taste
i love the puck flavors this vienna blend is very nice it is medium roast so it is not too strong has a wonderful flavor without being a flavored coffee one of my favorites ,yummy coffee , great coffee
we purchased an assorted package of k cups by various makers and of all the coffees this is my fave i really cannot see any reason to ever taste test another flavor it smells delicious and tastes delicious too ,the best coffee ever , great coffee
well the creme caramel was on sale so i decided to give it a shot plus the fact that each k cup is individually prepared by mr puck himself anyway i quite enjoy these i never buy flavored ones so overall i am happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as i usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild ,decent flavor , good but not great
honestly the first time i tried jamaica me crazy i had to double check to make sure that i did not leave the pod my last cup n the coffee maker weak coffee flavor did not appeal to me either might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side wolfgang vienna roast was pleasant though ,tastes like i did not change the kcup from the last cup , not as good as it is
love the flavor but of the cups in the count box were misshapen melted as if they would been exposed to heat during filling my husband used two of the ones that were not affected so i am not returning them but certainly wish quality control had caught this the affected k cups are so misshapen they will not fit into the space in the keurig ,k cups and , great taste
never got a delivery as fast as we did this time we were running low on our special coffee we have sampled many k cup coffees some in assorted packs and decided this is the best it is mellow never bitter and always totally enjoyable ,puck breakfast in bed coffee , great coffee
this is my second favorite after the breakfast in bed flavor i love wolfgang puck coffee it is a little bolder then the breakfast in bed but still smooth ,second favorite , best coffee ever
this is our favorite k cup at home mellow and flavorful br br also i wanted to clear up the question of whether or not this is decaf it is not see the response i received from wp coffee br br is breakfast in bed k cup actually a decaf coffee br br thanks for reaching out to wolfgang puck coffee the breakfast in bed is not a decaf blend br br thanks br m br customer service br wolfgang puck coffee ,breakfast in bed great smooth medium roast coffee this is not decaf , great coffee
the hawaiian hazelnut is my favorite k cup flavor from any vendor but it is always out of stock on amazon com it seems that all of the other puck flavors are available for a very reasonable cup price and sold directly by amazon com but price fluctuates wildly from rd party and has not been available directly from amazon com for months as i am writing this the price of a pack is from the cheapest rd party retailer which is absolutely ridiculous amazon why cannot you stock the hawaiian hazelnut the same way you stock the other flavors the fact that i would take the time to write a review about this should tell you how much i like the product ,hawaiian hazelnut always out of , great product
a discount from the amazon warehouse otherwise k cups are a little expensive when amazon does this it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly br br as i expected the expiration date is for a month or two from now so they were trying to get rid of them i also noticed the seals did not seem as tight as they normally are this also could be because it was sitting in amazon warehouse in the heat all summer br br as i expected about half of these k cups burst open while brewing this is not usual and i have tried many different brands this made them leak so clean up was kind of annoying and not taste as fresh but it still tasted decent bottom line when k cups are discounted from amazon warehouse be ready to pay in other ways lol ,good taste but are loose so they are open , not bad but not great
this is just the perfect thing to end a tired day the taste is smooth and warm and creamy i find that i look forward to having a cup while i read for a few minutes what a treat ,yummy , great taste
this coffee is good and has nice subtle flavor i am disappointed though because i looked at the bottom and it says decaf i bout you but i drink coffee for the caffeine in the picture on bottom of box has text but it is so small i did not even consider looking on it so just disappointed that is decaf and does not say on page when ordering ,this coffee is decaf just so know does not say on , not as good as i have
this is good vanilla coffee i got this and the green mountain and prefer this one it has a nice sweet flavor ,good vanilla coffee , good coffee
wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut coffee for keurig brewer good medium strength coffee with hazelnut flavor full body enjoyable anytime of the day i really like this coffee ,wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut k cup coffee , wolfgang puck k cup coffee
i really enjoy wolfgang puck k cups so far all the ones i have tried have not left my stomach and br br this was my first time trying out the sorrento fair trade roast and purchased it on a warehouse amazon price deal i am really happy with my purchase the taste of the sorrento is what i would expect of a medium roast a good smooth blend no bitter acidic after taste and leaves you wanting for more after that first cup at least it left me p it is does not leave you with the either it has that right balance you need with your daily cup of coffee br br yes i will be getting another count of this when i am finished with this pack br br stars ,the is smooth good blend no after taste , good coffee but not a great price
coffee quality is as good as expected but close to next time i will spend the extra few dollars and buy the coffee ,close to date , good coffee
i am a relative to keurig coffee but i do know that i was generally disappointed in the drink produced however the breakfast in bed k cup produces a nicely balanced not too thin cup without being too harsh i still have not achieved anything like what i can make either with my french press or with my drip machine but it is definitely better than the at work alternative community coffee ,best so far , not as good as it is
if you like a balanced cup of joe this is a great choice the coffee is smooth and balanced there is no bitterness or bite thank you chef puck for this fantastic decaf coffee choice ,makes a great cup of coffee , great coffee
smooth with a hint of flavor medium boldness yet rich in taste not a wake me up but certainly enjoyable ,breakfast in bed , good coffee
my second purchase of this like the first cup it has been wonderful to wake up to not too bold or but a good drink to start the day with ,excellent taste , great taste
the best thing that i look to every morning it makes my day the best tasting coffee ever ,best coffee ever , best coffee ever
i really enjoy this one and i have tried many in my top a little pricey but will order again sometime in the future ,good coffee for strong coffee lovers , good coffee
i too purchased this product thinking it might not be a flavored product and before it arrived i looked it up to see that there was some as to a coconut flavor br br so lets get this out of the way do not purchase this is you do not like flavored coffee it is flavored br br the first thing you notice is a deep coconut aroma almost akin to hazelnut in its presentation the initial mouthfeel is good a light roast but a to the roast which settles in nicely with the flavor which br has a definite dark chocolate taste without the bitterness br br the finish is chocolate jamaican coffee and faint toasted coconut br br bottom line if you like flavored coffee with coconut hazelnut cocoa you will like this coffee ,good if you like flavored coffee , good coffee
jamaica me crazy is an awesome smooth coffee light coconut vanilla flavorful taste br a good coffee if you do not like real strong coffee highly recommend ,puck favorite , great coffee
i got one k cup of wolfgang puck colombian reserve dark roast as part of a variety pack that i bought here on amazon since i would always assumed that i preferred the less burnt flavor of a light or medium roast i was pleasantly surprised that i enjoyed the way this coffee sat on my tongue it is sweet full and gently bitter i brewed it in a oz cup in an effort to dilute it a little but i may be enough to try a oz cup the next time around ,great i prefer a light medium roast , good coffee but not a great price
smooth delicious cannot wait to with my coffee i love all the wolfgang puck coffee flavors never a dull flavor ,mmmmm , great coffee

this is the best k cup coffee that we have been able to find very rich flavors and a medium roast we love this one ,best high quality k cup , best coffee ever
i am not a huge flavored coffee fan usually i prefer lattes with flavored syrups a friend sent me a k cup to try and the smell was mouth watering before it even finished brewing the flavor was strong enough to drink it only with milk i added a little vanilla syrup when i it i am not a coconut fan but the flavor is barely there it is just a unique taste for when you are in the mood for something different ,smells amazing , not as good as it is
i loved this brand it was the best vanilla flavor of others i tried i would buy more if it was a better price ,wolfgang puck coffee vanilla , great coffee

i have tried a wide selection of k cups including the big names like starbucks tully donut house dunkin donuts etc and they all have something in common either too watery weak or too bitter strong i tried breakfast in bed based on the reviews and i was not disappointed it is flavorful without being strong or weak it is hard to get a cup of coffee from a keurig that tastes like it was brewed like a normal coffee machine this k cup is the exception i will be stocking up ,great blend to get the day , good coffee but not a great price
love the wolfgang puck restaurants cookware brand products all his brand products cuisine are amazing i am a loyal fan yet this creme caramel coffee is tasteless no real coffee flavor no hint of caramel or creme it brews like a bit of steamed milk that somewhat pasty tasteless feel on your palate soooo dissapointed as i am such a loyal fan of all his brand products sadly a waste of did not return because i think food items are none refundable ,a wolfgang puck customer , great coffee
did not realize it was flavored and thought when i had my first sip that it tasted like chemicals f gave it away the next day at work ,it , not as good as it is
good but the green mountain reserve sumatra is better by and a half stars sort of tastes a little stale ,good but not perfect , good but not great
wonderful flavor would purchase this blend of coffee again light flavor not bitter at all and price was great the best i found anywhere ,wolfgang puck k cup breakfast in bed , great coffee
i find many of the k cups are a bit bitter for my taste i want something simple and smooth this coffee is wonderful ,smooth coffee taste , great coffee
wolfgang puck colombian coffee is delicious i find it to be a smooth and flavorful dark roast with a lovely aroma yet without a bitter or acidic quality that might leave an unpleasant aftertaste it is a bit expensive like all k cups but i think it is worth it due to convenience and exceptional flavor i definitely recommend this coffee to others ,delicious coffee , great coffee
not much of a coffee drinker but this wolfgang vienna brand is good not strong but a mellow taste the flavored coffees are getting on my nerves and this is just a good everyday coffee flavor everyone in the family and visitors like it would buy again ,this is very good , not as good as it is

while i love flavored coffees i had never tried any of the wolfgang puck line this moved to the top of my favorites list with the first cup not only is the aroma delightful the flavor is excellent as well i drink my coffee black and this one has no bitter after taste and the flavor is not overpowering the flavor is a very light coconut and the coffee is a medium body i must admit that i was a little hesitant about a coconut flavor do not be everyone around me wants a cup i refuse to share ,yum , great coffee
wolfgang puck french roast is a nice bold not too bold flavorful cup of coffee if you like a href http www amazon com gp product b coffee people extra bold organic dark roast coffee for keurig brewers count k cups pack of a then you should like wolfgang puck french roast br br this french roast has a deep flavor with a hint of sweetness and a smooth finish a good choice for a morning cup of coffee br br recommended br br note to manufacturer as a consumer i wish you would use real coffee descriptions i e hints of smooth finish rather than advertising like bring the aromas of france home with you and moments enjoy the good moments what does that really mean it took me awhile to decide to purchase this coffee because the description gave me zero idea of what to expect ,bold but not teeth bold nice flavor and a nice cup of coffee , not my favorite
choice for your morning coffee if you like a medium slightly bold flavor vienna coffee is not a real bold coffee so medium roast coffee drinkers should like the flavor br br vienna coffee house has less of a kick than a href http www amazon com gp product b q wolfgang puck french roast dark roast count k cups pack of a but a little more than a href http www amazon com gp product b chfudc coffee people donut shop medium roast extra bold for keurig brewers count k cups pack of a br br good flavor slightly sweet with a good bean taste that is not tough on your stomach br br to the manufacturer please your coffee descriptions they are terrible and give the consumer no information on the flavor style of coffee featured if you want us to buy the coffee be on your descriptions ,solid medium roast coffee with just a hint of bold good flavor not acidic , great coffee flavor with a good cup of coffee
that freshly brewed aroma that the coffee people x bold does however the taste was another story it hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice sharp bite that gets your attention right away the finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice or cinnamon and just a slight lingering pleasant bitterness i really like this coffee but i think that i will stick with coffee people extra bold and this will be my back up brand however i will keep looking for something new who knows what i will find br br a href http www amazon com gp product b eo newman own organics special blend extra bold k cups for keurig brewers count boxes pack of a br a href http www amazon com gp product b l coffee people organic extra bold k cups for keurig brewers pack of amazon frustration free packaging a ,another great dark k cup coffee , great coffee

the box in small print i checked my current box and saw no such labeling information however the new boxes i received are a different color with a on label for hawaiian hazelnut and now the bottom of the box says it is made from decaff coffee while i like the flavor i do not want decaff in the morning which is when i drink coffee br br unfortunately i am unable to return this item to amazon because of their return policy which is why i am writing this review to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now i would give more stars for flavor but the lack of notification in the product description that this coffee is decaff makes me feel as if i tossed my money out the window buying something i would not have otherwise ordered ,this coffee is now , this is a good coffee
fans of donut house and coffee shop looking for that balanced smooth brew we found ourselves coming up just a bit short in the strength flavor area were made in brew size and eventually adding in a bit of emeril bold or various dark roasts well problem solved with the b in b smooth and flavorful and a good eye opener was worried the name somehow less caffeine based on our experience in these areas stars the except on three seperate occasions out of two boxes purchased we had k cups a small pop during brewing that sent coffee grounds over and in the keurig counter top and coffee cup this at our home brewer and our vacation house messy very messy requiring and careful cleaning inside cup holder and area minus star umm exactly who makes these things and where hopefully a road bump on the way to peace ,great cuppa except , not bad but not great
i have this flavor shipped automatically now along with several others this happens to be our favorite and i have to remind my husband the two boxes need to last until the next shipment a slight coconut aroma and flavor is so amazingly delightful in the morning not overly strong and perfect for our taste buds our favorite part of waking up in the morning ,our favorite , great coffee
are looking for a k cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting this coffee is not for you in my opinion you get a sumatran because you love strong coffee watered down it loses its get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor i make mine with k cups at the smallest setting by i would give a starbucks sumatra a rating for boldness the puck is about an the diedrich is a br i highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers provided you use the smallest cup setting you will not be disappointed best k cup i have had yet and i have tried many newman timothy donut shop diedrich etc br br addendum i have since tried th green mountain sumatran and gave that a one star stale and bitter i will definitely stay with puck ,outstanding bold best of the k cups , not my favorite
i bought a wolfgang puck sampler and this was certainly one of my favorites so i ordered a bigger box and have truly been enjoying it this is a classic medium roast cup of coffee it is very smooth with no bitterness i would say that if you enjoy donut shop tully kona and caribou you will like this blend the label is adorable and makes me smile when i pop it in the keurig each morning ,a very nice smooth coffee , good coffee
my favorite flavored coffee this is not available in any of my local stores better price than i have found at any local stores as well ,my favorite k cup , great coffee
been trying every coffee brand and flavor for over a year now and this is it i just love this coffee you should try a small box and see if you agree everyone has a different taste for coffee so you may not like it but worth a try i always say if you do not buy a ticket you will never win ,best coffee ever , great coffee
if you liked flavored coffees this one has a hint of coconut to it this is my favorite coffee by far i look forward to my first cup every morning ,coffee makes me a crazy , delicious
i love this coffee great taste and great way to start your morning if you like flavored coffee you will like this ,awesome coffee , great coffee
these k cups are great the coffee is mild and yummy but still very flavorful i love this cant wait to get my next shipment ,my favorite k cup so far , great coffee
this flavor is horrible there are many other flavors much better hawaiian hazelnut is great breakfast in bed is awesome ,not good at all , great taste
i caught this as a warehouse deal for k cups this was my first experience with any wolfgang puck coffee br the rodeo drive blend is good average coffee nothing exceptional i prefer a little stronger bolder coffee but at this price it works for me there is other brands that i like a little better but with k cups cost per unit is always something i have to factor in br i d buy it again cup but i probably would not full price if you keep your eyes peeled you can always find a good deal just have to be patient and stock up when the deals arise ,good coffee great price , great coffee
this is great coffee i am a coffee purist i do not add cream or sugar unless it is weak or bitter i truly enjoy coffee i have tried many different types of coffee for k cups this is my new favorite the price was amazing too very smooth and subtle hazelnut flavor not overpowering ,i am a coffee , great coffee
well we were looking for another coffee that would meet or exceed the k cups we were using and this has far out tasted the coffee cups we were using i have bought almost packages of these and used just about all of them and will be ordering a few more boxes here soon great coffee from a regular guy point of view ,great coffee , great coffee
take it from someone who was tried a lot of different k cups buy these the breakfast in bed blend is full of great flavor roasted perfectly and more importantly i have been choosing it over green mountain which says a lot it is true to its name perfect for the morning ,great coffee , great coffee
reading the previous comments people have stated they did not know this was a flavored coffee but it clearly states that it is atleast it did on the sight i bought mine from i was only brought to amazon for the secure feature it is a delightful flavored coffee depending on how you brew it and is a pleasant wake up any morning ,outstanding , not as good as it is
i did not know this had a coconut flavor or aroma as i got it in a variety pack i put it in this am and immediately smelled coconut and thought oh no i do not like sweet in the am but its not sweet i am quite surprised at the flavor and how i like it would i like it every morning no but it was a nice change made me feel i was waking up in a cottage on the ocean hearing music well maybe not but it was close ,coconut in the morning , not as good as it is
love my keurig coffee maker and i enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours a href http www amazon com gp product b wolfgang puck coffee creme caramel count k cups for keurig brewers pack of a seemed to be a safe choice i love coffee with cream i love caramel i even like wolfgang puck but his creme caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment it is not awful it just lacks a certain depth of flavour even using the small cup setting the aroma is very nice but the taste is a bit watery black the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste but it did not add any of the caramel creaminess i was expecting in short the coffee taste is very mild and the caramel taste is not all that great sorry wolfgang but i am afraid this one is a ,sorry wolfgang , not my favorite
i like dark strong coffee but i just did not really care for this one not sure what it really was almost a tad bitter unfortunately i have another whole box of to use up i picked up some sumatran reserve also a dark and prefer it ,just okay , not as good as it is
i have tried many different k cups and this has remained my favorite for the longest time it is the perfect balance not too weak and not too bold and since i usually drink my coffee black the flavor alone is very important to me it has a great flavor and not too acidic ,perfect every day coffee , great coffee
if you like your flavored coffee to taste like coffee this may not be for you i could not taste the coffee at all in the travel size brew but the smaller brew sizes were a bit better ,too much caramel cream not enough coffee , not as good as it is
amazon had this as buy one get one free and since it was my favorite i could not resist great purchase ,great coffee great price , great product
this product is great tasting and you do not even need sugar or creamer but if you like sweet coffee i would say a little sugar and creamer would not hurt this is a perfect product to wake up to every morning ,great taste , delicious
this is a smooth not bitter coffee it is a little more pricey than some which are just as good but it has a good sweet flavor and i can recommend it ,pretty good coffee , good coffee
i bought a small pack of this locally and liked it so much i bought the pack great deal on amazon ,tastes great , great product
bought a sample pack today of the jamaica me crazy and love the flavor the flavor is not too powerful nor was it overwhelming i would recommend the wolf gang puck k cups ,crazy , not as good as it is
i personally do not like strong coffee if you like weaker coffee then this blend is a great choice for you other reviews on here say that its too weak which is probably true if your used to something strong br br i also use flavored creamer to further enhance the taste for the price it cannot hurt to give it a try ,great taste and priced , not as good as it is
this is the smoothest and best tasting keurig coffee i have tried it is not bitter not too weak not too strong just right ,yum yum , great coffee
these are awesome as are all of wolfgang puck k cups the coffee is smooth the cups brew perfectly the taste is unbelievable my husband and i are hooked on these the price is great considering what amazing coffee this is ,can wolfgang make a bad k cup , great coffee
wolfgang puck french roast has a deep robust flavor i prefer it in the afternoon sometimes with a shot of oh yeah ,puck french roast , great coffee
i have tried every single french roast k cup and this is one of my favorites the starbucks and the barista are the two best french roast k cups but the between wolfgang puck and those two are negligible this one has that great sweet smoky flavor that every good french roast should have ,nice french roast , great coffee
this one is my wife favorite of all the hazlenut blends she has tried this is her go to after a busy day of being retired br delivery was exceptional as usual could not ask for much more ,wolfgang , great
a bold sampler pack while i found it flavorful i would not call it bold my first wp k cup was french roast which i found extremely bitter this coffee does not have that problem br br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano br br my favorite k cups are br starbucks french roast br starbucks caffe verona br starbucks pike place roast br green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve br green mountain double black diamond br green mountain revv br green mountain dark magic br br other k cups i have tried coffee people jet fuel green mountain dark magic decaf emeril jazzed up decaf starbucks caffe verona coffee people black tiger starbucks house blend starbucks breakfast blend starbucks sumatra wolfgang puck french roast green mountain lake and lodge green mountain french roast caribou mahogony wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya emeril big easy bold ,i would not it bold , i not not my favorite
my husband used to like the nantucket blend saying that it was awesome then he tried this one and it is the only one he drinks i drink other flavors but i like taking sips of this one for sure my husband is very over these cups and says it is the only one he drinks if you are a coffee drinker definitely try this one ,wonderful tasting coffee , good coffee
i drink my coffee black so quality is a must this is an excellent medium roast with a smooth consistency and perfect amount of kick i love all the puck coffee k cups but this is absolutely my favorite ,love this , great coffee
one of my top favorites it is infused with coconut and has a very unique flavor this coffee is best enjoyed without cream or sugar and it will become one of your favorites or you will never buy it again some of my other favorites are vanilla biscotti butter toffee hawaiian hazelnut and donut shop ,one of my top favorites , great coffee
i drink a lot of coffee and i buy several different types i found this particular one to be pleasant tasting with a nice aroma while brewing there is no after taste so you always want another cup ,good tasting coffee , not as good as it is
wonderful tasty coffee with a nice aroma as it is brewing there is no after taste at all and it very satisfying you always want another cup of coffee i continue to buy it ,great coffee , great coffee
a very nice flavor with no after taste it gives off a nice fragrance while brewing and has a very satisfying taste you have to have another cup ,nice flavorful and full , good
dark and full flavored but distinctly columbian this is a great morning coffee better cup of am joe than you will get at a coffee place ,good columbian , good coffee
there is so many different k cup to chose from so i asked in the store what brand and flavor is bought the most they suggested wolfgang puck coffee breakfast in bed the only had a few on the shelf and i was not disappointed now i am hooked for you people that use creamer this coffee is so good you will not even need creamer ,breakfast in bed review , great coffee
my favorite of the wolfgang series discovered when trying all of the flavors in the available sample pack very good flavor consistent with each pod and not overdone with added flavors very good dark roast colombian cup of coffee from the wolf ,wolfgang how to brew it , great coffee
we have tried all of the hazelnut flavored coffee brands this is by far the best to bad it is not an auto ship ,the best hazelnut out there , best coffee ever
there is not much i can say that has not already been said but when i brewed this coffee i really was not expecting to like it at all seeing as i do not normally like coconut flavored things but i really like the blend of flavors to me it does not really taste like coconut as much as it does just tropical ness in general it is like palm tree flavored coffee and the flavor is not too overpowering at all it still has a nice coffee taste it is just right ,great blend of flavor , not as good as it is
this is a dark smooth brew darker than timothy french vanilla but as with timothy it has only a slight hint of vanilla this is my third taste test searching for the best vanilla flavored coffee gloria jean was undrinkable timothy was pleasant but not as deep a roast as this if it only had more vanilla flavor this would be my hands down favorite ,only a hint of vanilla , good coffee
i have tried lots of flavors of coffee and this one is my favorite great taste not bitter at all a great flavored coffee for people who do not really like the taste of coffee ,great flavor , great coffee
the aroma is awesome love the flavor really gets you going in the morning prompt delivery this is definatly my husbands favorite single cup coffee ,great coffee , great coffee
after years with the keurig this is the best if you like a medium blend it perfect its smooth and has taste not watered down on either setting ,the best , great coffee
the caribou regular and morning blends which are ok but i can hardly drink them unless there is a creamer of some sort in them br br so on a recent trip to bb b i their wall of k cups and this one caught my eye i am generally a fan of flavored coffees and this sounded good so i bought an cup pack i have to say it is delicious the coconut flavor is light but definitely there and does not leave a bitter aftertaste like most black coffees do it smells so good my co workers have done a walking by my desk to ask me what smells so good br br obviously if you are a coffee connoisseur this will not be for you but if not it is definitely worth a shot and the best part for me aside from the flavor no stomach upset ,yum , good but not great
wolfgang puck makes the best coffee the package arrived on time and in perfect condition i would definitely order this again ,i would order again , coffee
have enjoyed every single cup of breakfast in bed just the right kind of brew to wake up these old bones and get me started on the day also enjoy it while watching so i can join enjoying a brew as well ,makes you feel like you are breakfast in bed , great taste
i love this brand the best hazelnut flavor ever i wait for it to go on sale because it is more expensive than the other brands also as another reviewer noted it does say decaff on the bottom of the package it really should state that in the product description i have noticed the packages from bed bath and beyond did not state this but cannot imagine both are available i will still purchase it because the flavor is so smooth ,my favorite hazelnut k cup , great product
for the best br br thankfully hawaiian hazelnut blows all of the other hazelnut k cups out of the water it is smokey and delicious without being dark and overwhelming the hazelnut really does taste like actual hazelnut which you would think would be something a coffee drinker could take for granted but we have been disappointed in the past i would never tried coffee from the wolfgang puck brand before but our positive experience with hawaiian hazelnut has definitely gotten me interested in trying other varieties br br the hazelnut flavor is pretty bold and full bodied which is nice but there is no bitterness or acidity to be found this suits me just fine since i enjoy a milder roast but people who enjoy their coffee strong and dark might not enjoy this blend as much br br we ll definitely be this coffee when we run out ,an excellent hazelnut choice for your keurig , great coffee
if you like to taste the flavor in your flavored coffee skip this one i have struggled to taste the creme caramel flavoring that is supposed to be in here the coffee flavor is also slightly bitter but that could just be my taste buds longing for some flavoring i would recommend green mountain gloria jeans or van houtte brands before this one ,where is the caramel creme , not as good as i be
i love this coffee it is one of my all time favorites it has the best flavor and i like the light roast br br excellent ,best darn coffee , great coffee
i love my keurig but have not found my perfect cup of coffee yet although this comes close i prefer a medium brew not bold or strong breakfast in bed is my choice so far ,good morning coffee , great coffee
i love sumatra coffee and was excited to receive these k cups however was disappointed when i opened my amazon box and found that the plastic wrap holding the two boxes of k cups was full of grinds meaning that there was a possible of a cup after carefully unwrapping the boxes and attempting to get as little coffee grinds everywhere as possible i opened the first box and all cups were fine however the second box every kcup was covered in fine grinds and i had to clean each one and found that of the cups were defective due to the top being on at an angle and the grinds had spilled everywhere i now see other reviews stating they had defective cups as well however the taste of the coffee is good ,tasty but defective cups , great coffee
jamaica me crazy is a sweet coconut flavored coffee that has a mild aftertaste it is not a bold blend but rather a mild to medium blend that more mild br br this is certainly not a first cup of morning coffee for die hard coffee drinkers who lean towards the medium to bold blends i would consider it a second cup of morning coffee afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee br br flavor is ok i would like it better if the aftertaste did not linger for a flavored coffee it is not bad if you are a coconut fan it is a blend to try on for size ,sweet coconut flavor with a mild aftertaste mild to medium blend , not good
truly not much needs to be said because it is wolf and to wake up to his coffee here at the house is fantastic ,it is , not as good as
i expected more flavor from w puck though this coffee does taste good it did not have caramel flavor as expected this is my opinion someone else may feel differently the price is okay i would not discount this product at all it is a good product try it you may like it ,good not great , not as good as it is
i have tried all vanilla coffee k cups and by far this is the best wolf gang puck vanilla francaise is a smooth vanilla experience that lasts way after the coffee is consumed try it you will love it ,best vanilla k cup coffee ever , great coffee
i am not a huge coconut fan so i was not excited about trying this but with one sip it definitely won me over the flavor is perfect and is now one of the flavors in our regular rotation and it smells so good ,delicious , not as good as it is
this is my daughter favorite k cup product mild medium roast it is the next best thing to having wolfgang cooking breakfast for you in your kitchen ,wolfgang puck breakfast in bed , great coffee
wow that is what my husband said when he tasted wolfgang puck jamaica me crazy coffee for my keurig he is not a fan of strong coffees and he really liked this one we both do i highly recommend this one can you put it on the subscribe and save a href http www amazon com gp product b v wolfgang puck coffee jamaica me crazy count k cups for keurig brewers pack of a ,this is the best , great coffee
i am sure this flavor is not for everyone but if you enjoy your coffee on the sweeter and more flavorful side then you should enjoy this it is not what i would call a strong coffee by any means i would describe it as mild and flavorful ,my favorite k , not as good as
i just recently got a keurig coffee maker registered it online keurig sent me a coupon for buy boxes get free awhile back a local bagel shop had a coconut coffee that i fell in love with so i decided to try this coffee out because it has coconut in it i brewed my first cup this morning it smelled very strong of coconut so of course i could not wait to try it after it cooled down a bit i took my first sip amazing it is quite delightful i strongly recommend it if you like coconut coffee no bitter aftertaste either no soot the bottom of my cup awesome ,delicious , good coffee
i was really impressed with this coffee it has a nice bold taste yet a smooth br finish i would order this coffee again ,good coffee , good coffee
when i t find island coconut k cups anywhere i found this and decided to try it although it is not exact it is so close it puts a smile on face the coconut is not over powering but you can taste the hint of it certainly i love this and would order again and again because this is available and island coconut is not ,so close to coconut k cups , not as good as it is
this is my absolute favorite coffee flavor out there i am so glad it comes in k cups and i am glad it is so inexpensive ,favorite , best coffee ever
i find this particular brand as good as the local coffee shop coffee d d which is a compliment to the maker i have made this particular brand my choice ,puck coffee breakfast in bed k cups , great coffee
i have at least dozen different k cups at my house right now because we love to experiment with different flavors my favorite is timothy rainforest espresso because i like a bold coffee but others that prefer something milder say that breakfast in bed is their favorite i like it to but only when made as a stronger brew i have purchased maybe boxes of this since it came out ,one of the best mild k cups made , great coffee
i normally drink only donut shop but when i saw this on sale i thought i would give it a try i was quite impressed with it and really enjoy this one i have now added it to my list of favorite k cups to buy ,this coffee is very good , not as good as it is
vanilla flavor is barely noticeable acidic taste not at all what i expected breakfast in bed and hawaiian hazelnut are much better choices ,disappointed , not as good as it is
i really like the flavor of this one it has a low acidity but still full of flavor now i have to have it every morning and i am having trouble finding another one i like this much ,love it , great taste
i am actually suprised from reading some of the about this coffee i have tried k cup varieties and this is by far my favorite contrary to some reviews i do not find it to be weak at all and in fact is quite bold but with absolutely not hints of being bitter very smooth and leaves a great aftertaste i prefer really strong coffee and this is a good compromise for a medium roast as it is not as bold as i would normally prefer but certainly strong enough to satisfy my preferences br br i typically drink wolfgang jamaica me crazy but ever since trying rodeo drive i have not gone back ,superb coffee , not good
i recently bought a pack of this coffee at bed bath and beyond as its brewing it smells great if you like coconut the taste is not bad but for me it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have i gave it stars because it is not terrible but i would not buy this coffee again if you are sensitive to after taste i would not recommend i would grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee ,a bit disappointed , not as good as it is
i am usually not a fan of flavored coffe or coconut for that matter and when i bought the sampler pack of jamaica me crazy i honestly did not see that it was a flavored coffee the aroma that it gives off while brewing me to a tropical island somewhere the flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all a great new addition to my coffee line up ,surprisingly delicious , not as good as i like
this is the best tasting coffee available on k cups the flavor is amazing it is more expensive than other brands but for a reason definitely worth trying ,best coffee ever , best coffee ever
this is one of the best coffees i have ever had for my keurig it is a nice smooth coffee and the price is the best price i could find i will be buying more ,excellent good tasting coffee , great coffee
my husband and i are with this coffee we take kcups and hide them around the house because we wanna make sure it lasts a long time such a bold and delicious flavor ,awesome flavor , great coffee
i had tried this coffee before it is wonderful smooth and rich full flavored but not too bold i would recommend it to anyone ,great coffee , great coffee
i tried this coffee even though it was significantly more expensive than the green mountain organic free trade sumatra that i have been using for some time wolfgang puck has the name and the rep br br if this were the only sumatra dark roast on the market i would be really happy with it this is good coffee br br it is not outstanding coffee compared to folgers this product is awesome unfortunately for mr puck i am comparing it to green mountain sumatra br br the organic and free trade sumatra from green mountain is better to my taste and it is cheaper mornings are good ,good but not a premium coffee , good coffee but not a great price
the coffee is good however the k cup is not packaged well the coffee machine barely coffee more of a fast drip the whole idea is it is fast right ,good coffee bad packaging , good coffee
it was a bit of a risk to order this i mean what are you going to do with boxes of kcups that taste terrible but this was delish the flavor was really good and it was still awesome after it had cooled down it has a coconutty vanilla flavor very nice ,love it , good stuff
i like the jamaica me crazy better but when it is out of stock this is my second choice br br it got a nice flavor strength without being bitter ,good flavor , great coffee
personal thing is not it so i will just tell you as a gauge my all time favorite k cup is timothy midnight magic a california roast which is dark i am partial to dark roasts and probably would not have even bothered with this sorrento but a friend had it so i tried it and lo and behold i am very glad i did i find this blend even better than puck ray which is his dark roast there is a whole lot of good flavor here the word luscious comes to mind this one not available every where and comes at a slight cost premium i say it is worth it these will be a regular for me ps a suggestion which seems apparent as with any k cup when you try a new blend use the plain old cup setting to check it out the first time ,i really like this one , not as good as i have
this is my favorite kcup i would describe it as medium dark creamy and rich and very consistent a lot of k cups seem acidic to me so i am really glad i found this one ,love this creamy coffee , great coffee
very delicious coffee thankfully amazon sells this flavor now i have been waiting for it since i tasted this last year i like the fact that you sell it in a pack rather than a single ,tasty , great coffee
a nice variety and freshly made one at that br br the salon has a nice variety of k cups wolfgang puck timothy and green mountain that owns keurig br br everyone taste vary but here is my of the ones that i have tried so far wolfgang puck was my second favorite so far i like folgers the best br br folgers gourmet br selections colombian br price per cup cents package of for br earthy flavor fruity and nutty flavors come through br br wolfgang puck chefs reserve colombian dark roast br price per cup cents package of for br a dark roast with caramel and earthy notes slight burnt br and papery flavors br br timothy decaffeinated colombian medium br price per cup cents package of for br a bit on the weak side kind of papery and less astringent than the others br br ali review ,not my favorite but it came in second , not bad but not great
delicious coffee good medium blend its hard to find something that isnt too weak or too bold with k cups but this flavor was perfect will buy again ,delicious , great coffee
good flavor coconut flavor is subtle and not overpowering in comparison there is another coconut coffee by green mountain in which the coconut flavor is overdone in my opinion ,good coffee , good coffee
the coffee is just ok a little weak the price is a little high and it is not worth the extra money ,wolfgang puck dark roast , not as good as it is
i was surprised to find out how weak this coffee is it has a good flavor but even on half cup it is very weak ,very weak , good coffee
to me this has a good balanced flavor some flavored k cups seem too light on hazelnut or too light on coffee this one is just right ,my favorite hazelnut coffee , great coffee
this k cup actually smelled up the office and it tastes as good as it smells i found it to be very flavorful ,smells good tastes good , good coffee
i was surprised to find out the coffee from my sampler had coconut in it i bought a sampler of k cups to try different flavors and would sit aside the ones that i liked to order in the future br br after drinking jamaica me crazy not realizing the ingredients just knowing i liked it when ordering reading through the reviews realized it had coconut in it and that was what made the taste so yummy leaving me wanting more i was hesitant to buy but decided to go for it and am really glad i did everyone i have shared my coffee surprise with loves it too ,me crazy so good , not as good as i be
light and flavorful definitely describes this k cup i often find it hard to find flavored k cups that are not either so strong you lose the flavor or so light you would be better off drinking water however i have to admit i have found a new favorite in the hawaiian hazelnut ,my favorite k cup yet , great product
i loved this coffee i just got my order a few days ago and i normally drink just one cup of coffee in the morning now i cannot wait and have had an afternoon cup too i must say i look forward to getting up in the morning just because i know i am having this coffee says a lot for a sleeper try this one i like it on to highest setting on my keurig it has an awesome aroma while brewing and the taste is smooth never bitter and there is something that hints of a slight with the first sips then the end of the sip is just a perfect brew too never any aftertaste or bitterness i am so happy to have found this thanks wolfgang i have now all of your kitchen cookware and now the coffee too ,first but not last time to buy this one , good but not great
best k cup around a must try amazon ships quickly and in one piece i would recommend the coffee as well as going through amazon to order this coffee from thank you for a great experience ,yum o , great coffee
usually do not get the breakfast blends but it was on sale and decided at price would try it out it was not as weak as some breakfast blends tend to be not bad ,on , not as good as it is
wolfgang puck definitely has the best coffee for the money i absolutely love the french vanilla the kcup actually makes a good full cup of coffee it could be a tad stronger but overall it is really good i still prefer the senseo pods to the kcups though ,best coffee , good coffee
jamaica me crazy has a slight overtone of cinnamon that is a very nice compliment to the taste of coffee the flavoring is strong enough to taste not just smell without overpowering the flavor of the coffee very good ,jamaica me crazy is our favorite k cup so far , great coffee
i drink my coffee with a splash of half and half other hazelnut k cups are too bland for me i much prefer wolfgang puck excellent rich roast with definite but not overpowering hazelnut flavor ,perfect , great coffee
d timothy world coffee breakfast blend for keurig brewers count k cups pack of a but this one edges it out smooth and balanced it really is great from the first sip till the last drop br br there will never be a coffee that all coffee lovers will agree on but if you like a light medium roast give the breakfast in bed blend a try very low in acidity someone who cannot tolerate the acidity in coffee may be able to enjoy this blend but be aware and contrary to popular belief light roast coffee is typically higher in caffine than the dark roast coffees the extended roasting to produce a dark roast burns away some of the caffine this one will definately get you going in the morning in a good way br br those who prefer a dark roast or extra bold should probably look elsewhere ,excellent smooth light coffee good anytime , not my favorite
taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before i mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning small print on the bottom of the box i mean point tells this several mornings of headaches could have been avoided this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine i do not know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale ,good taste but decaf , not as good as it is
too bad no one else had reviewed this before my purchase it is not bold or dark enough to stand up to the keurig rd button and tasted a little tangy for my liking ,down to go , great taste
this coffee says medium roast but is actually a little stronger we loved it and it has become our favorite if you want some coffee to caffeine you up this is the one for you also wolfgang puck breakfast in bed is great not so strong ,puck rodeo drive k cup , great coffee
i cannot remember when i have had a cup of coffee so delicious i immediately wanted another cup there is no bitter taste no funny chemical taste you get with so many flavored coffees no odd aftertaste it is just a mellow gorgeous hazelnut with a touch of the islands cup of coffee outstanding my favorite i have ever tried and i have tried most ,delicious , not as good as it is
this is very good coffee but it does not have as much flavor as the van creme caramel if your looking for something that has a lot of flavor go with the other if you are looking for something that is more coffee than flavor this is it ,not as good , good coffee
by far this is the best flavored k cup coffee i have ever had good body not bitter no flowery aroma like with the green mountain flavored k cups i like my coffee a little stronger than puck hawaiian hazelnut but it is certainly a fine medium bodied coffee i could drink over and over ,i would buy it again , best coffee ever
these k cups are wonderful we were pleasantly surprised with the low acidity and smooth flavor the rodeo drive k cups are on our top five k cup list ,smooth delish , great coffee
k cups to make one extra large travel mug of coffee br that said we have found that mixing this flavor with other flavors to make an extra large serving is a most enjoyable at our house the most popular combo so far are jamaica me crazy with a href http www amazon com gp product b van houtte french vanilla k cups for keurig brewers count boxes pack of a hazlenut a href http www amazon com gp product b m van houtte hazelnut decaffeinated k cups for keurig brewers count boxes pack of a or costa rican a href http www amazon com gp product b hkzz i van houtte caf eacute costa rica light roast count k cups for keurig brewers pack of a in the end this is one of the most versatile flavors for those of us who have frequent visitors and several to please ,mmm great coffee aroma , great coffee
bought this during one of amazon friday sales did not find too many reviews since these are fairly new took a chance and am very pleased we like our coffee rich and strong and this one delivers great tasting dark roast coffee ,yum rich strong and not bitter , not as good as it is
this coffee is surprisingly delicious we never had a problem with the k cups bursting maybe it is a defect on the coffee brewer this coffee is a bit less strong than we normally prefer our coffee but it makes up with great taste look forward to my mug every morning would definitely recommend it and will buy it again ,yummy hazelnut , great coffee
i personally did not care for the coffee too mild for me and a little nutty flavor in it i will stick with tully kona and house blends also emeril big easy bold ,coffee , good coffee
exact same as the ones bought at the store only a lot cheaper recommended for any keurig drinkers out there ,great , great product
this is my favorite coffee blending of hazelnut and coconut are perfect thank you br br question why was i charged postage on this brand when i have never paid on any other brand of k cups from amazon ,wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut , great coffee
if you like your keurig you need to try this k cup smooth taste with just a slight hint of flavor not overwhelming like some brands my new favorite ,best flavor available , great taste
this is our favorite k cup coffee it is strong and taste great although it seems that many of the k cups have nearly the same overall taste ,favorite of the keurig coffee k cups , best coffee ever
more than a hint of coconut not very much vanilla being a vanilla fan and not a coconut fan this is ok ,coffee lover , great taste
this is a good tasting k cup from a guy who drinks coffee black and prefers a bold full flavored taste i would recommend ,works for me , good coffee
i love using k cups although i have tried so many bad coffees i have finally hit on one dark roast coffee that is not bitter and has a wonderful flavor you do not have to try them all this is a perfect blend coffee ,you do not have to look any , great coffee
ok so this is the best flavored coffee ever no after taste that seems to always occur w flavored coffees its not even really flavored it has hint of coconut taste but it really still tastes like coffee just the best coffee ever mmmmmm add honey yummy br highly recommend ,should be best flavored coffee ever , not as good as it is
wolfgang puck k cups are under the their coffees are smooth and delicious and jamaica me crazy is my fav and the best coconut flavored coffee on the market island coconut is quite poor in comparison ,my very k cup coffee , great coffee
i have always hated the or starbucks burnt bitter taste this is a great blend still strong without the burn roasting br br fyi low quality beans are burned to hide it is bad taste ,perfect blend , good coffee
i like the darker roast coffees and this fits the bill this is every bit as good as deidrich and but typically costs more i guess wants a cut if you catch it on sale buy it ,excellent brew , good coffee
this coffee is a lot like the green mountain nantucket blend if you like that you will like this generally the gm product costs less but this was on sale ,pretty good , not good
it was as good if not better than i was told great taste i will it again ,jamaica me crazy coffee , not as good as
probably because it does not taste like coffee it is flavorless i saw the good reviews and thought i would get a couple boxes and now i am stuck with a bunch of k cups that i do not want to drink because i would rather literally drink any other k cup i have ever tried as you can see i am not a fan of these k cups these are the worst ever ,i do not enjoy this coffee , not as good as i have
i will drink this if all other coffee options are the coffee has a vanilla coconut smell but after a sip or two i cannot drink it would not purchase again and i am having trouble even giving it away i expected more from wolfgang puck ,if there were no other coffee in the house , not as good as it is
i love caramel and was excited when this arrived but i am so disappointed hardly any flavor at all of coffee or caramel ,caramel , great taste
who prefer a strong dark cup of coffee even at the larger mug setting should try that brand br br previously i had found the dark roast green mountain coffees rather boring but revv lives up to the hype both in strength and flavor another great green mountain coffee is their espresso blend though amazon does not stock it so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick and mortar stores such as bed bath and beyond finally a favorite regular over the years has been a href http www amazon com gp product b m w yq emeril big easy bold a it is a very nice coffee though do not expect the new orleans experience of chicory flavor br br bottom line you will not go wrong with the wolfgang puck coffees but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees ,unremarkable , unremarkable

this is an excellent full bodied coffee without a bitter taste in general the wolfgang puck coffees are quite good although a little more expensive than some of the other k cups ,excellent coffee , great coffee
as always i love this coffee it is about the only kind i buy for myself the turn around time is terrific when i have about a week worth of cups left i order and have the next batch in perfect timing very happy with everything about this product ,jamaica me crazy k cups , great coffee
this coffee is a smooth yet robust taste that does not have any bad after br taste a href http www amazon com gp product b wolfgang puck coffee rodeo drive blend medium roast count k cups for keurig brewers pack of a ,wolfgang puck keurig cup coffee , a cup of coffee
i have tried many brands of medium roast coffees however this is my favorite some i have tried are bitter some are too light some are too strong but this one for me is just right some brands more than others come in all puffed up and when punctured the grounds filter out into the needle of the keurig coffee maker and has to be cleaned which is not difficult just annoying never had a problem with these breakfast in bed k cups are smooth not too light and not too strong right in the no bitter after taste either and perfect any time of day enjoy ,just right anytime of day , good coffee but not a great price
sometimes we have a problem ordering the k cups because they are way too strong for us even if you order medium blend this coffee was great just right it was a smooth blend and was perfect for a morning cup of coffee or anytime would definitely order again ,great smooth tasting coffee , good coffee
reviewers taste buds are weak this is some br weak coffee i am not some crazy gotta have my jet black sludge to get br through the day coffee drinker i would say my favorite and my wife is br caribou blend this blend is weak it cannot hold half and half or even br just whole milk without being wiped out now i will say i brew it on br the large cup oz i believe setting on our keurig so maybe it br a bit better on the oz setting or even the small setting but caribou we br also like donut shop green mountain kona blend etc can be easily br brewed on and hold a good bold taste this coffee doesn t br hold a candle to any of those now i am stuck with of these blech maybe br the guests will not mind it ,either i got a bad batch or , not bad but not great
good description of this product has the over roasted popular coffee flavor but not overpowering one of my favorites so far ,great flavor , good coffee
i ordered this by accident and i am so happy i did this is a new favorite of mine it is nice and strong without being bitter ,wolfgang puck sumatra , great taste
pretty good i can see that some people might make this their favorite because it is different br br will i buy this again no it is good but it is not my preference and i might as well buy the ones that make me rave on and on about how good they are usually tully french kona italian and house those may be too strong for some people and the rodeo drive blend does have its own unique taste which may really appeal to some coffee drinkers as with most things actually a little more than in most things with coffee it is a matter of taste and probably a matter of what you are in the habit of drinking you may want to try this one especially if you can find it in a sample packet or do like i do keep the rest for guests to try ,not bad smooth not bitter strong but not too strong , not bad but not bad
i really love this coffee great tasting and bold however on about rd of the pods the foil from the cup and blows grounds into the brewer and my coffee cup i can usually which ones will do it because the foil on the k cup is not puffy like it has pressure but flat and wrinkled ,great coffee k cups , great coffee
it is coconut flavored either you will like it or not i was actually surprised since i am not a big fan of coconut but i liked this coffee not my favorite but nice on occasion ,did not say anywhere it was coconut , the best
my friend says she loves this coffee and has never been able to find it in the local stores where we live she did not know that amazon sells just about anything you could want no tax and free shipping what could be better ,bought this for a friend , great product
hazelnut being the household favorite favorite i thought i would give these k cups a try the flavor is smooth and delightful i suggest trying this brand for your k cup machine ,yum , great coffee
this is good but could be a bit stronger in the hazelnut flavor it is good though and i would purchase it again ,wish i were in , good
i love the taste but have found that many of the cups explode the glue on the side of the cup becomes and then the cup very hard to clean up do not think i will buy this brand again ,poor quality , great taste
i love jamaica me crazy coffee this version is flavorful the price is pretty good and it sure beats the office pot coffee that sits on a for hours fresh coffee fast ,great coffee , great coffee
this is less of a bold flavor and more of an acidic and bitter coffee my wife is easy to please and she is not a fan i will finish the box but i reach of others first ,a little too much acid , good coffee
this coffee has become one of my daily favorites it is not quite as strong as many of the french roasts but it is also not as bitter a good way to start the day ,a good daily roast , good coffee
this is my favorite so far amongst the wolfgang puck k cups the word that comes to mind when i sip it is bright it has a natural sweetness and good flavor without being overly heavy the packaging lists it as a medium roast but i would put it more towards the light end of the spectrum it is a very enjoyable cup and i would recommend if you are looking for something to switch up with green popular vermont country blend or breakfast blend br br i generally have not been impressed with the wolfgang puck flavored varieties vanilla jamaica me crazy but this regular cup is quite good ,one of the best for puck k cups , great coffee
i have had all of the various since they came on the market for home use thus i have tried pretty near all of the various k cups this is one of my top favorites love the coconut in it and the wonderful coffee flavor yum ,one of my favorites , great coffee
this coffee was not what i expected but enjoyed it greatly i was looking for a stronger vanilla flavor but after trying it i enjoyed it a lot it was light and smooth and left no aftertaste i would recommend this to others ,very satisfied with my purchase as always with amazon , not as good as it is
i like columbian coffee and this is above average with a good dark color with a nice smell the taste is bolder than average but not unpleasant or bitter this is my strong columbian coffee combining all the good things of the type with a bolder taste ,a columbian , not good
smooth i normally drink dark roasts but purchased this on a lightning deal or maybe a friday sale i like it ,i liked it , good coffee
the coffee is just ok it is very mild almost on weak would buy it again if the price was right ,just ok coffee , good coffee
i have tried every bold k cup and this is one is one of my favorites very nice flavor and strength ,great coffee , great coffee
bought this on the recommendation of my son not a big fan of flavored coffee but a cup a day of this lightly flavored coconut coffee puts me in the islands how can you go wrong with wolfgang puck ,me flavorful , not as good as
this coffee says dark roast extra bold and it isn t it is weak and barely beats out a cup of folgers ,wolfgang puck sumatra , great coffee
we have a keurig coffee maker one of the side benefits is the opportunity to experiment with different k cups i have already tried half a score some seem pretty tasty at first until one taste something that is even better some early k cups that i highly do not compare too well with later brands that i have tried br br wolfgang puck columbian dark roast noir is one of the better products that i have tried it has a bold taste although not strongly so it is also smooth tasting br br it is now on my short list of possibilities for my first morning cup of coffee so i am pretty happy with wolfgang puck product here ,average k cup coffee , good coffee
this is my favorite coffee flavor and i have not had it in a long time forgot how delicious it was until we ordered the k cups love them already ordered more ,me crazy , great coffee
we have only been using the k cups about months both my wife and i like our coffee bold i have been by amazon reviews and started out with coffee people jet fuel although that is still my favorite i got this french roast on a friday sale and would say that it is my new second choice i have also tried coffee people black tiger a close third and kona not a fan this is a nice well rounded every day cup more on the bold side but not so ,nice rich flavor good cup of coffee , good coffee
the flavor of this coffee is good it has a nice balance of vanilla without being too strong it is not the coffee but it is a nice afternoon treat br br that being said i have had problems with several pods when you hold them up to the light you can see that there are grounds outside of the filter portion of the pod this causes a cup full of grounds when you brew the coffee and also clogs up the pin at the bottom of the pod i would say about out of every or pods has this problem ,good flavor but bad quality , not as good as i be
i love the taste of this coffee but in my last order of four boxes about every other k cup has a tear or rip in the internal filter and thus the grounds flow through into the cup of coffee which the value of the coffee as drinkable wolfgang needs to correct this flaw in packaging i will not order again because of the waste ,for not again , good coffee
i bought this coffee for my keurig coffee maker and i really like it smooth and the best thing it is an organic wolfgang uses the the best beans for his coffee buy you will be pleasantly surprised ,k cup wolfgang puck , great coffee
great tasting coffee strong but not strong and no nasty aftertaste too bad it cannot be purchased on subscribe and save anymore ,wolfgang puck coffee coffee house , great coffee
this is the best all around st cup in the morning coffee ever i love it perfect flavor ,up to , best coffee ever
by far the tastiest coffee i have purchased from amazon sorry it is not in the shop and save any longer delicious ,breakfast , great coffee
love this blend so was delighted to find it on your subscribe save program at a better price br than w keurig so really disappointed to learn today it was no longer available on said program br shame on ,fave k cup french roast , great coffee
i have tried about different k cup flavors and this is my favorite it has a wonderful aroma and just the right amount of hazelnut use the subscribe option and this is a deal that cannot be beat ,very nice taste , great coffee
i admit i like my french vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side this isn t it is a much stronger coffee brew meaning more sugar and creamer is needed to tone down the coffee flavor on the other hand it is a reasonable alternative if my preferred brand van houtte is not on sale or when it is occasionally out of stock i like that it comes in a pack because our family goes through a lot of k cups and i do not have to order quite so often ,not as sweet as other french vanilla coffees , not as good as i be
i buy these with subscribe and save i like the flavor and aroma going on month two and i am not tired of them yet ,great coffee great price , great product
i was very excited when i received a keurig coffee maker as a christmas present could not wait to put it to use however in the three months since i have had it i have struggled to find what i think is a good cup of coffee most of the brands i have tried have either been too weak or too strong br br i am not a starbucks kind of coffee drinker or fan of fancy flavored coffees i just like a regular cup of coffee that smells good when it is brewing tastes smooth when i drink it finally just like said this one is just right ,what i have been looking for , not as good as i have
one of the weaker flavored coffees but a yummy one almost no need for milk as it is already creamy tasting ,yum but weak , good flavor
this coffee is awesome kinda bold with a sweetness excellent my son says with international carmel creamer you can find in the dairy section ,for true coffee lovers , great coffee
the coffee was great spent some time in jamaica and got to love the coffee nice to get in back home as well ,great coffee , good coffee
i got this with the purchase of different bold coffee k cups to find the ones i like best and so far this is my favorite it may not be bold enough for some but it is not supposed to compete with the extra bold varieties this was smooth and not nearly as bitter as many bold coffees so many bold blends have a burned flavor leaving a bad taste in your mouth this one was strong without the bad aftertaste perfect for me ,very good coffee , good coffee but not a great price
i like full bodied coffee and to try something different to supplement the standard one i use this coffee was perfect for that purpose timothy rainforest expresso is still my standard one but i will order this again ,good k cup , good coffee
creme caramel is by far my favorite great coffee flavor not too weak with a wonderful caramel aroma ,rich and wonderful , great coffee
i drink alot of coffee and love hazelnut coffee this brand has the best flavor i have ever tasted i have bought several different brands and this one is the best it may be a few dollars more but it is worth it i absolutely love and enjoy it every morning ,great coffee , great coffee
years ago my daughter brought home creme brulee for the first time it was perfect beans to be ground since then i have searched for anything similar when i realized i could not find it she had what one she purchased br br this one has a strong flavor but it tastes fake with a strong after taste unfortunately it is one of the better ones if anyone reads this and knows what ones carmel and vanilla taste great please post here ,cannot find the perfect creme e coffee , not as good as it is
i really like the taste of this coffee my only complaint is that the coffee grinds end up in my coffee not a huge fan of that and even though i really like the taste of it i will not order again bummer ,yummy coffee not a fan of coffee though , not as good as it is
my favorite i have it auto shipped through amazon the only problem i have is i drink way too much coffee now because i like it so much ,my favorite coffee , great coffee
this is one of my favorite k cups it is a rich dark coffee without the bitterness of some highly recommended ,one of my favorite k cups , great coffee
i thought the coffee tasted fine it was not strong enough for my husband several of the pods burst during brewing i probably will not purchase this again ,ok , great coffee
this is my favorite of the flavored coffees i am not usually a fan of coconut but this coffee is deliciously coconutty chocolaty love it ,scrumptious , great coffee
yummy mild and delicious my new favorite mild in to coffees called fuel and taste like oil but truly a medium roast pleasant in the morning makes you glad to have a good cup of coffee ,my new favorite , great coffee
wolfgang puck coffees are great and the creme caramel is one of my favorites i would recommend this coffee for people who like a mild flavor ,great flavored coffee , great coffee
i thought that because of the name attached that i would be wow its just a good average coffee nothing spectacular ,decent coffee but i , not as good as it is
i bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite jet fuel or emeril big intense bold liked this one typically sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well br br i am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label br it is not bold it is extremely mild and smoky tasting not a single member of my family liked it and that is very unusual br br i m going to contact the company to see if they will exchange it or refund me it is that bad ,horrible did something , not as good as i be
as coffee in general this wolfgang variety was alright however i was expecting a creme caramel taste or something similar and i do not feel this delivered i tried multiple cups at different cup sizes and this coffee just did not do it for me it is marketed as a flavored coffee yet i could not taste anything beyond the flavor of coffee ,misleading flavor name , not as good as i have
i prefer mild to medium coffee and i have tried so many different k cups but i will stay with this one the other reviews were right on smooth and not any bitterness just a great cup of joe with amazon prime it came super fast if you are not a prime member i strongly recommend it ,yummy , great coffee
this is a good french roast coffee although it could be a little bolder i have never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup it is extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess ,cups can be defective , great coffee
i am having a blast with my new keurig machine trying out a bunch of new flavors including the dark roast it is nice and flavorful particularly since i run each of my cups through the small cup brewing cycle times to fill my large mug this works br tried the chocolate donut flavor the other day and loved it br love the convenience and bargain prices of the subscribe save ,love the dark rich flavor , great taste
i am impressed with mr puck different blends this one is a favorite of ours it lives up to the medium roast name full bodied not acidic and smells great while brewing will buy again ,very good cup of coffee , good coffee
great deal great what a difference from other orders i have placed with other vendors got the package the day after i ordered it ,great deal , great coffee
if you like vanilla flavored coffee this is it i put a french vanilla creamer in and no other sweetner is needed i have it every day and i will always order ahead so i do not run out ,best coffee ever , great coffee
this coffee is bold and none of the bitterness that is usually found in bold coffee it also in the single serve coffee ratings and i concur there is a lot of out there in k cups this and wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut are great ,high rating , great coffee
i got this is a low cost alternative to my normal jet fuel and it just did not measure up i like strong coffee but this had a bitter taste that i just did not care for also of the cups had some sort of and dumped their grinds into my cup not sure why ,not my favorite , not as good as it is
very smooth and flavorful for a medium roast i was pleasantly surprised by this k cup and would get it again the off deal me to it and i am glad ,very tasty , great coffee
this coffee is not a true medium roast like caribou french roast donut house etc there was not much coffee flavor at all i found it to be so weak in flavor that not only did i have to go down a brew size but i also have to add less milk just too drink it i will never buy it again wish i did not have more cups to go thru ,not much flavor to this coffee , not as good as i have
i ordered wolf gang puck k cups largely because of his reputation and my experiences at his restaurants both of which are good however when i drank my first cup of the breakfast blend i tasted no coffee it was as if i was drinking hot water i was very disappointed and will purchase only those k cups which i know to be good sorry wolf gang this is a sleeper ,kcup breakfast blend a , not as good as it is
this is my favorite of all the coffees i have tried smooth and flavorful without being a flavored coffee its a definite treat anytime of day ,great brew , great coffee
i was expecting a mellow caramel flavor but this coffee is a bit sharp and you really cannot make out any carmel flavor ,a bit of a disappointment , good coffee
in a k cup machine at an ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee since i brew a cup for my wife and i at the same time i run two ounce cups with one of these k cups into a small and then pour into two coffee cups which still yields a strong flavor but not enough pop your eyeballs out br br of course brewing two cups with one k cup drops the price down in half which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of k cup brewing i find most k cups are good for up to a ounce cup and ounces would them too much but this works for my wife and i since i have been a cup for each of us for years and brewing two cups with one k cup is economical ,strong dark roast coffee , i love it
i am only drinking it so it will not be wasted and i have to rotate it with a coffee people product so i remember why i like coffee it is really the strongest flavor profile is tin i love creme caramel and am a huge wp fan but the flavor and consistancy of this coffee does not impress choose another you will not be sorry you did ,so weak , not as good as i will
my favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like french italian and full city this k cup dark roast has a big bold flavor but lacks balance the level of smokiness bitterness and acid are way too high and the result is not enjoyable i liked the dark roasts for the keurig from green mt newman and donut shop much more than this one ,too bitter and , not good
this product takes getting used to only after using about k cups did i start liking it however i would not buy this many again ,taste , good
i am loving this coffee it is smooth and bold but not too bold it reminds me of starbucks coffee but not as bitter very very very good cup of coffee give it a try i am really glad i did ,my new favorite kcup , great coffee
i love wolfgang puck products but the coffee is very disappointing br there is a weak flavor almost tastes diluted br some must have changed out all the real puck products br ,weak coffee little flavor , great coffee
this is the st k cup coffee that i am getting grounds in my coffee it is about every cups i have not had this problem with other k cup manufactures i will not reorder ,defective , good coffee
until i tried vienna coffee house donut shop was the one i had on automatic monthly delivery vienna coffee house is a tad bolder than donut shop but very smooth without any bitterness from the first cup i knew i had to switch ,better than , delicious
of all the k cups i have purchased so far i like this french roast the best it has a really bold taste even used with the large cup button i like other coffee selections too but this one really stands out br br i consider myself an early adapter and the keurig coffee machine is one of my best purchases although the coffee is somewhat expensive at a cup there is no waste no pot cleanup and best of all great coffee i usually get up earlier than the rest of the household and can have my great coffee almost instantly without making a full pot that can go sour before all being drank br br i notice that regular such as target and grocery stores are now carrying k cups but buying online costs less and is more convenient ,favorite k cup , great coffee
i do not drink a lot of flavored k cups but people have been raving about wolfgang puck k cups so i gave this a try it is definitely a good quality flavored coffee with a medium body overall i have enjoyed several cups of this and have temporarily my timothy flavored k cups in favor of this one i sometimes add sugar free vanilla syrup cream and cinnamon it is excellent that was in place of dessert i also tried caramel syrup added to this do not do it it overwhelms the flavor ,good quality one of my go to flavored k cups , not as good as i have
i love coffee with no bitterness and lots of good coffee taste and this one fits the bill holds up well to milk sugar i love it in the morning for the first cup and in the evening just as much definitely would buy it again ,good medium coffee , great coffee
i love love love this coffee it is easy on my stomach yet it has a rich medium roasted flavor which in my opinion is not bland at all it is such a delicious cup of coffee i have told everyone about these i have even converted green mountain lovers over to wolfgang puck rodeo drive brand if you like your coffee fully flavorful and delicious but not too robust or bold this coffee is for you i have tried many k cup brands tully green mountain emeril donut shop etc and this brand is equal to green mountain possibly even a bit better ,my favorite so far , great coffee
having had wolfgang puck k cups i was hoping they would be as good as the wolfgang puck coffee i have had in hotel that were a part of my room but alas i was mistaken i would not say it is the worst i have had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too i feel like i am drinking coffee that is been made with grounds that have already been in other words the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and i am getting leftovers br br if you are looking for a flavored coffee that does not really taste like much of anything this is your pod if you are looking for better richer flavors stick with green mountain which sadly amazon does not seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge for a box ,just , not bad but not great
this is a fantastic decaf coffee my parents love decaf but there are not many out there they enjoy we have been drinking timothy decaf colombian and we bought this to try it fantastic i would definitely buy this again and again it is smooth and not bitter it is not super strong so do not expect it to be like a this is a really great colombian cup of coffee you will not miss the ,delicious amazing for a decaf coffee , good coffee
i like my coffe of the milder but tasteful side i thought this was a great cup of coffe i compare it to timothy shoppe full flavor but not acid this is for people who want a lighter cup of coffee ,great cup of coffee , great coffee
i tried a double boxes of this when the donut shop coffee i usually order was unavailable while the coffee is pretty good the cups suck a full of the cups brewed are undrinkable they are slow to brew coffee maker has to work very hard and even then the cup retains an amount of water checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed they could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee i believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable ,never again , great coffee
me crazy is the best coffee it is not too strong and has a unique taste no complaints here highly recommend it ,love it , best coffee ever
i like bold coffees and should have trusted the other reviewer who said it was not strong enough this one has a watery finish to it and not very much flavor i will be going back to emeril jazz d up decaf and trying the coffee people french roast decaf so far i have loved everything by the coffee people except the organic blend if you like strong coffee do not buy this but if you like a weaker coffee that you can see through you would probably enjoy this one ,it is okay but i will not buy it again , good coffee but not a great price
this not only tastes great but has the best aroma while brewing subscribe and save is the way to go ,one of the best flavored k cups , great coffee
i love this coffee i am not a strong coffee drinker and this coffee is perfect i have no problems with it working in my cuisinart keurig brewer i get the perfect tasting cup of coffee br br i gave it stars because one of the packs contained only k cups and not the that it was supposed to have br br the decaf count pack of arrived with the correct amount of k cups and is as yummy as the high test ,great taste , great coffee
trying out different pods and this is a delicious one service was excellent no hassle at all will buy from again ,coffee , great coffee
some of the other out in keurig land but it is not bitter there is just a little of something chocolatey in the flavor br br my only complaint is that this coffee like most of the keurig cups that do not say extra bold on them they brew up pretty weak if you do a larger mug i typically brew the oz size and on these guys i it down to the oz size if i brew it in the larger cups it just comes out too weak br br if you are one who feels that k cups usually make weak coffee you will think that these are really weak and be tempted to brew em two at a time this coffee is not plain or there is just less coffee in the k cup or rather the normal not extra bold amount so it brews up weaker ,interesting flavor brew small cup , not as good as i be
i like this coffee its nice to drink it in the morning it has medium body and full flavour goes great with raw sugar and splash of non fat milk ,nice , great coffee
this was the flavored coffee i have ever had in kcups i purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag it smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what i expected i will stick to gloria jeans and flavored coffees this was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last i order of his brand i thought maybe i got a bad cup but i brewed and i opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same ,yuck , not as good as it is
i am a sucker for caramel anything love the flavor the aroma and most important the taste i honestly do not like flavored coffees in the morning but i have made an exception for this one ,wonderful flavored coffee , great taste
i am trying many different coffees to see which one i like best this coffee was good but a little stronger than i had expected i know it say extra bold but others i have tried have not been that extra i ended up putting it on my larger cup setting and it was perfect then there was a little after taste but not much more than other coffees i would recommend it if you like stronger coffees but it is not as strong as an espresso i intend to purchase this again ,good n strong , not as good as i have
i thought it had a bitter orange flavor however my husband and friend liked it ,tasted like bitter , not as good as
we have tried just about every k cup of regular coffee out there we do not do the flavor kind my husband loves the gm brand most of the coffees are mild even when they say medium roast i go for a little more on the medium roast like the some of the tully and caribou brands it used to be that we were always ordering the same brands once we liked a certain one but i to try the wolfgang puck line while this flavor is touted as a medium roast it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness it is still not a bad coffee just not as good as the rodeo drive or breakfast in bed k cups which has no bitterness i must say though we have now added the latter flavors of wolfgang to our buying ritual ,wolfgang puck k cups , not my favorite
i like a dark rich coffee and this is a tad different it seems much smoother and br i tend to nearly crave it when i have a slightly acid stomach it sounds odd and br i know i drink too much coffee but this fills that acid tummy niche ,smooth rich , not as good as it is
tried this for the first time this week and it is now my favorite coffee with a hint of flavor coconut full bodied and no after taste jamaica me crazy is just what i love for an afternoon pick me up or to wake up and have an immediate smile on my face seriously it is awesome highly recommended ,awesome taste , great taste
my husband likes strong coffee i like medium neither one of us like this particular one there just is not much flavor of any kind coffee or caramel we like the vanilla one much better we will drink this until it is gone but it is the last flavor we choose and it is lasting way too long ,bland , good coffee
the taste is fine but the k cup container has opened at the seal during the brewing process on more than one occasion resulting in a mouthful of coffee grounds i have never had this happen with any other brand of k cup before and hope it is not the norm for wolfgang puck ,k cup problem , not good
i prefer the extra bold coffees so this one really lacking on the flavor it is fairly weak at the smallest cup setting its drinkable but i will not be buying it again i would recommend the timothy world coffee rainforest decaf espresso instead ,just ok , not as good as it is
wolfgang reserve columbian decaf is probably the best decaf we have had in a k cup very good cup of coffee ,k cup fan , good coffee
this is a coffee that i look forward to drinking as soon as i wake up very nice ,delicious , great coffee
light vanilla favor not overpowering nice coffee the first box that was purchased was too light on the vanilla flavor and aroma surprisingly the nd box was much better one of my new favorites ,light vanilla flavor , great coffee
we love our keurig coffeemaker and have tried many coffees recently discovered wolfgang puck new line of coffees and are pleased with all of his we have tried this one is smooth with a great flavor no bite we would purchase this again ,great coffee , great coffee
this is a mild but delicious coffe some might say a dessert coffee i really liked it as a pleasant change from full bodied flavors ,good coffee , good coffee
was looking for a strong k cup that could hold up for the perfect espresso and for a great cup of coffee now receiving on auto ship if you are looking for a great bold k cup this is it ,perfect espresso k cup , great coffee
i read several great reviews on this coffee on another site and decided to give it a try it is now one of my favorites and i will be ordering it again the taste is great sweet but bold enough that i can do a large size and it still have flavor ,one of my favorites , great coffee
great coffee has a nice bold taste for a medium roast coffee this is my new favorite give it a ,excellent coffee , coffee
i bought a two pack at the friday sale for reasonable but not an amazing deal i have been pleasantly surprised by the taste i do like the van whatever flavor french vanilla k cups and this contains significantly milder flavoring of a good tasting coffee br i would and have served it to company and highly recommend serving with milk or cream br br if you like flavored coffees you will most likely enjoy this one if you like it plain and black you will probably hate this ,smooth mild flavor not as flavored as other brands , good coffee
nice medium coffee blend that has a hint of vanilla and a touch of sweetness if you like a href http www amazon com gp product b emeril vanilla bean bam medium roast coffee for keurig brewers count k cups pack of a or a href http www amazon com gp product b i gloria jean coffees cappuccino for keurig brewers count k cups pack of a you should like this blend br br i drink this as an afternoon or dessert coffee with a splash of milk and a sugar packet br br stars because i would like just a touch more vanilla flavor br br we ordered another box of this coffee and the vanilla flavor seemed to be a little stronger than our first box ,medium roast touch of not acidic great with milk , good coffee but not a great price
taste is okay not blown away hidden is the fact that this is truly a decaffeinated coffee only place to find this out is on the bottom of the box not what i want first thing in the morning ,just okay decaf , not as good as it is
i am not a fan of flavored coffee and i thought i had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did i see any indication that it was a flavored coffee i wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by amazon were so that there is no as to what you are purchasing even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is jamaican coffee ,flavored , not as good as i be
i use to purchase jamaica beans locally and it was great this jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it the odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale other people in household tried it and could not get past the first cup pitched the remainder cups in the trash ,jamaica me crazy terrible , great coffee
this coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong but i have to say it almost ruined my months old keurig personal brewer the coffee is ground so finely that when the k cups are punctured by the needles top and bottom it gets packed into the needles and also out through the holes made by the needles going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty sludge in the bottom of each cup i purchased a pack of k cups and did not even use one full pack i do not recommend this brand or blend it is a waste of money which is something i could not really afford at this time i sent a letter of complaint to the wolfgang puck company and except for a cookie cutter letter receipt of my comment i have not received any further contact from them ,do not waste your money or your keurig on this , great coffee
unfortunately i am much too frugal to throw away something i have spent perfectly good money on so i am continuing to use these suckers until they are gone hopefully in a few weeks i thought i was buying a decent brand of coffee given the wolfgang puck name but alas i was wrong using the middle cup size on my keurig coffeemaker these k cups make a weak cup of coffee more like brown water no taste no nothing i switched to the smallest size cup and it is marginally better but still barely drinkable i would not serve these to guests ever i cannot wait to be done with these boxes of junk so i can order something with some taste please do not waste your money ,what a waste of money , not as good as i have
this was terrible coffee wolfgang pucks i received a partial refund but felt i should have gotten a full refund as i cannot drink the coffee and had to throw it all away also had to pay shipping and should not of had to i would like a response to this ,bad tasting coffee , not as good as it is
i found the taste and strength of this coffee just right for it to gain the of one of my go to coffees for my keurig not too strong or bitter i rather enjoy the flavor sadly with the recent k cup by green mountain coffees it looks like amazon is not carrying the wolfgang puck coffees any longer and my subscribe and save and my business will need to go elsewhere definitely give this coffee a shot if you can ,a pleasing cup of coffee , not good
the aroma is pleasant and flavor is nice and smooth but it is very very weak i really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save but i just cannot recommend it even making smaller cups it is very weak i am going to stick to newman own organics extra bold as my go to k cup for now ,nice flavor but very weak , good but not great
i had tried green mountain sumatra reserve and found it delicious and strong it is not available on subscribe and save so i read the reviews and opted for wolfgang puck my husband likes it and i like the flavour but it is very weak in comparison to the green mountain i have to order something else for me ,weak , not as good as it is
we love hazelnut coffee but this just did not have enough coffee flavor in it for me kind of on the weak side in my opinion i will keep looking ,meh okay not great , great coffee
love this coffee the aroma is as delicious as the flavor my husband would typically have a cup of coffee once or twice a month now he is having a cup several times a week ,great find , great coffee
i admit i am not terribly fond of flavored coffees but this one is not for us we both love the rodeo drive i have a good that loves this coffee i sent her ours ,crazy flavor , great coffee
i found this coffee to be great at first but as i started having it more and more i came to it on the large setting the coffee is way too watery also the flavor is very very overpowering and kind of tastes like bananas br br it is a pretty good mid afternoon or evening desert coffee but other than that it is kinda gross ,flavor and watery coffee lovers beware , not as good as i be
i am definitely not a coffee connoisseur but this stuff is bad it is a disappointment because i expected a wolfgang puck product to have more class this tastes artificial and it cannot stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener will not buy again ,what a disappointment , not as good as it is
the coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt i cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt will not order this again ,not good , good coffee
i am amazed that people are happy with this product i am not a drinker of the dark brews french roast or anything but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee this is completely tasteless the initial scent is delicious too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee ,really , not as good as it is
i got this through a decaf keurig assortment pack also from amazon and while i have enjoyed all of the flavors was so weak i had to post a review ,no flavor very weak , not as good as it is
to me this coffee was extremely bitter i dumped it out and made a different cup it made me afraid to try other wp coffees but i did like the wp sumatra kopi raya br br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano br br my favorite k cups are br starbucks french roast br starbucks caffe verona br starbucks pike place roast br green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve br green mountain double black diamond br green mountain revv br green mountain dark magic br br other k cups i have tried coffee people jet fuel green mountain dark magic decaf emeril jazzed up decaf starbucks caffe verona coffee people black tiger starbucks house blend starbucks breakfast blend starbucks sumatra wolfgang puck french roast green mountain lake and lodge green mountain french roast caribou mahogony wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya emeril big easy bold ,bitter , i not not my favorite
the brand br br so wolfgang puck got the tried different flavors this one sorrento is not my favorite of the bunch currently colombian chef reserve it has a bolder strength which i believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider medium but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it cream and sweetener do not correct for this and thus i am a bit disappointed but again it was a in the dark br br i think if you prefer a slightly bolder slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee this may be for you i like the character of the colombian chef reserve but it is not as strong and perhaps that is just what my taste is towards i do not believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the wolfgang puck line however cannot say the same for some other k cup brands ,not a fan of this blend , not as good as it is
this wolfgang puck coffee jamaica me crazy is the worst coffee i have ever had br i threw it out right away after one sip it taste like all coconut flavoring br hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was they should be fired ,worst coffee i have ever had , not as good as it is
ugh no where on the amazon page for this item did it state that it was hazelnut flavored i have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it thought it was going to be a blue mountain like jamaican coffee ,hazelnut , not as good as it is
this coffee is only mediocre in quality i do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do i like it when the coffee within weeks of the order date the only reason i am not more with this lousy coffee is that i paid very little for it by using a credit i had at amazon i do not recommend this coffee ,mediocre , good coffee
it is a medium roast pleasant coffee comparable to green mountain breakfast blend i bought it with a very good deal though ,good coffee good deal , good coffee
making such a bad cup of coffee so i tried again a week later with same results i use average to good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like green mountain nor emeril everyone i know that has a keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup usually the results are stunning and the keurig lives on when i share i will stick with offering the coffee peoples black tiger or jet fuel now i have more wp fr k cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of let me know if you want them as i would be embarrassed to even give them away sorry wolfgang but what the puck your french roast is horrible and at k cup prices i will not be again i will stay away from any of the other wp offerings ,simply it is terrible , not my favorite
this stuff tasted like tobacco smells my son did not like it either and i ended up throwing it out ,horrible , not as good as
i got the coffee for per box ordered boxes such a great deal as the coffee is a great blend br br if anyone is upset because of the website having issues when they were trying to buy it they should not review the product poorly as it is not the product that is the problem br br the problem is that you are jealous you did not get such a great deal on the coffee grow up kids this coffee is great will buy from amazon com llc again for more k cups for my keurig br br all of my coffee arrived packaged well and in new condition nothing wrong with it ,just got the coffee love it , good coffee
highly recommended for those who appreciate a good dark roast coffee wolfgang sumatra kopi raya the flavor buds and one morning always a good start to any day ,satisfying , great coffee
ok today this company decided to put them up for sale at per pk this advertisement was on net br br well went to order and refreshed the page and in my cart was now at dollars so they sold one out of my cart br next i waited mins to see if it was a fluke and net started claiming dead link br br well upon refreshing again they were now for one pack br br hey ridiculous seller get with the program if this is your way of quick money i think people are much then that upon pressing confirm my order round of to you for being so un tech ,never got a and still , not as good as it is
no thanks kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard organic bold and donut shop are still our ,bitter w of , good flavor
the worst it is just plan awful bitter and strong and you cannot taste the hazel nut flavor at all do not buy this product save your money ,the worst coffee , not as good as it is
k cups are marginally better than good coffee that i can buy at the store for the price or less this product was offered at and i was willing to purchase it but it immediately went up to it is not really worth and is certainly not worth any increase additionally what is the deal on offering instant coffee in k cups for leaving us to think it is a good deal on real coffee do you want to lose our trust business that is a good way to do it br ,wolfgang k cup , great coffee
i thought this coffee was really horrible had one cup and will throw the rest away because it cannot be returned ,taste like old , not as good as
i ordered the vanilla coffee for my college age children unfortunately there were shipping delays and it did not arrive until the kids had returned to college for the fall update to come when they finally come home for a break it may be a while the other coffees i have ordered have all been tasty and a very good value i have no reason to believe this will be any different i can say that the k cups and the keurig have been delightful i enjoy having a freshly brewed cup every time and like that i save a bunch of money by brewing at home into a travel mug rather than stopping to drop for a cup on the way to work saves all those styrofoam cups too ,cannot much , not as good as i have
i bought both the creme caramel and this hazelnut kcup and i could not tell them apart even if my life on it the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too and unlike the caramel one this one has a nasty bitter aftertaste like the flavor is artificial yeah i know it is artificial but i hate that it actually tastes like a chemical yuk br br this is one of those coffees you can serve to company who does not know good coffee or people you do not want to have come to your house any more as one cup of this and they will not be your friends after it it really is quite bad ,yuk aftertaste and weak coffee make this one to , not as good as i be
definitely not extra bold medium roast at best not particularly memorable doesn t have a good coffee aroma but it is pretty decent tasting at this point i am not sure if i would reorder ,not extra bold , not good
this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good dont buy this coffee this is a review of people there are people in my shop we all hate it not good ,horrible coffee , good coffee
i am not a coffee snob if i was i doubt i would own a keurig i just want a decent tasting cup of coffee with little cleanup br br i ve tried many of the flavored coffees but they are too for me starbucks brand tastes burnt to me even their roast in stores i mean i have not tried the starbucks brand kcups br br i like this breakfast blend because it is not too dark not too light it tastes like what no coffee should taste like i order the biggest size to get the best value br br update i just tried to create a review for the jamaica me crazy coconut flavor which i thought was terrible and i love coconut i should specify that the original review was for breakfast in bed ,great balance , not as good as other
i was so excited to try a new bold coffee needless to say i am disappointed i would rate this coffee as a medium if it would have been listed as a medium i would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a medium strength coffee in taste and flavor i will still drink it from time to time flavor is smooth not bitter overall i wish that i would have ordered some more jet fuel or black tiger ,disappointed this is not bold coffee , not good
i do like this coffee but even with subscribe and save amazon price is higher than k cups at bed bath beyond convenience is one thing but since there are bb all around me it is pretty easy to pick up my coffee there and save a few bucks i wish amazon would price their coffees more i would buy here exclusively if they did but this is good medium roast coffee not quite as strong as i would like but a little stronger than the breakfast in bed version i may need to try sorrento and see if it is a little bolder ,good stuff but overpriced , not as good as i have
so here is another example of a pack of k cups i bought i figured well i really enjoy sumatra bold smooth and rich with a bit of bitterness flaver so why not wolfgang puck has a few restaurants so maybe he knows coffee br br so this is utterly average in all it is not very bold or rich although i can say it does have the bitterness which is a bit as it lacks the richness purchased only because it appeared on the subscribe save at a great price per k cup that makes two wp that have been run of the mill at best sumatra french roast next time i will be more discerning ,average from wolfgang puck , great coffee
i really like to mix things up with k cups and rarely buy ct boxes of a single flavor exception to the rule would be for dark bold coffees such as french roasts which i really enjoy so when wolfgang puck french roast turned up on amazon deal of the week even though i have never tried before now i have units br br it fairly non for a french roast decent aroma but taste is compared to for example a diedrich french roast i do not hate or even dislike it it is okay and for the price i paid is acceptable without complaint it may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich br br i d call it mildly bold average and i will not be going out of my way to keep it on hand ,average quality french roast , great product
my favorite k cup so far absolutely no aftertaste which in my book is a huge plus it is not acidic not bitter just a great mild cup of coffee which is exactly what it to be i wish other people would read the description before they give a bad review based on their own do not buy a medium roast coffee and complain because it is not bold also as a general rule the ones with breakfast in the name are milder i do not care for bold dark roast slap you awake coffee so i would not buy a bold coffee and then complain that it was bold ,great mild cup of coffee , good coffee but not a great price
i have read so many reviews on the many brands and varieties of k cups coffee preferences are so subjective i did like the flavor of this coffee bold but not bitter as to strength i wish that there was more coffee in each k cup i am accustomed to starbuck strength and i have to set my keurig to medium cup size to get the strength i need this is not as cost effective as say jet fuel but i found jet fuel too bitter br if wolfgang puck would add more coffee to its k cups this would be a perfect coffee for me ,well but weak , not as good as i have
wolfgang puck breakfast in bed is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one ,nothing special , great coffee
this coffee has a very tropical taste to it so it is perfect for iced coffee on a hot day the flavor is not bad when heated but it just seems a little odd br br you do not usually think of tropical beverages being hot ,best iced k cup i have had , good coffee
we have been enjoying our order of w puck sumatra kopi raya dark roast coffee k cups for the last week we find the delicious flavor very satisfying not so strong to be bitter and not so weak as to taste like colored water the coffee is perfect there is just the right amount of to make it an enjoyable coffee experience and it carries a nice lingering pleasant flavor and aroma it is not as strong as an espresso but maybe one step below like we said pleasant smooth and flavorful ,smooth and flavorful cup of coffee , good coffee but not a great price
i am not a fan of any of the decaf k cups i have tried but this one is probably the best i like strong coffee and his comes pretty close to what i would expect although it says medium roast ,pretty good for decaf , not as good as it is
i was intrigued how this particular blend got such an exotic name and i was not disappointed there is an ever so slight coconut aftertaste that makes this so delicious i do not like strong coffee and this is perfect for my husband and i i get it send regularly now and it is one of our favorites second only to jamaica me crazy by wolfgang puck wolfgang is much tastier than the other brands ,yummy , great taste
i tried this coffee on a half dozen this weekend and they all loved it for those that like their coffee mild i brewed oz cups for those of us that like it bold i brewed oz cups br br as an earlier posted noted it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees the taste is not obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee regular and black but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention br br i plan on trying all of wolfgang line wish he would offer a variety pack ,flavored medium coffee , good coffee but not a great price
this is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe it is artificially flavored and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it my household hated it of course that would be my problem if the description was accurate but it is not amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page ,warning this is a flavored coffee , not as good as it is
wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut is the best k cup hazelnut and i have tried them all we ordered this large pack because we sadly found out that wolfgang puck is discontinuing many not all of their k cups including this flavor buy this while you can ,the best hazelnut k cup , great coffee
so far of all the decaf kcups we have tried this is our favorite wish it were on the automatic ordering system coffee is such an individual like or dislike but when we use it with an oz cup of water it is great ,great coffee , great coffee
i bought the kuerig because i love the dunkin original and green mountain nantucket blend rodeo drive has now become my favorite it is very delicious and smooth ,best k cup coffee , great coffee
when i feel that i do not need more caffine i have found that the wolfgang puck decaf is a great substitute i really cannot tell the difference taste wise i had been having trouble finding a good decaf i think this one is it ,wolfgang puck decaf cannot miss , good coffee
sometimes i feel when i reach for a decaffeinated k cup that i am going to settle for less flavor however i am completely happy with this product i do not feel i am missing anything everyday i treat myself to a relaxing cup of coffee after work before starting dinner this product just fits what i am looking for ,what a great cup of coffee , good coffee
i got a k cup sample box of this coffee from and i find that it is my favorite decaf coffee it brews a smooth tasting cup of coffee every time i add some and a bit of equal and it is a treat any time br glad to have found this coffee ,enjoyable flavor , good coffee
wolfgang puck coffees are very good this particular flavor of decaf is delicious does not taste like decaf at all very rich flavorful also this was a very good value for the price i have recommended this product to several friends ,great decaf coffee , good coffee
my wife and i have decided hands down this is our favorite k cup we have tried a lot of others and donut shop and caribu daybreak are certainly still up there however this has a very solid body flavor with a medium roast almost a bold flavor with a smooth finish excellent flavor versus strength really nice to get up on a lazy sunday morning and have a nice cup of breakfast in bed br br also i see another reviewer had problems with messy k cups i can say after about boxes of theses i have not had any issues very unfortunate for the other reviewer but looks like it was rather br br give it a try you will certainly enjoy it the wife and i sure do ,my favorite k cup , great coffee
who prefer a strong dark cup of coffee even at the larger mug setting should try that brand br br previously i had found the dark roast green mountain coffees rather boring but revv lives up to the hype both in strength and flavor another great green mountain coffee is their espresso blend though amazon does not stock it so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick and mortar stores such as bed bath and beyond finally a favorite regular over the years has been a href http www amazon com gp product b m w yq emeril big easy bold a it is a very nice coffee though do not expect the new orleans experience of chicory flavor br br bottom line you will not go wrong with the wolfgang puck coffees but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees ,unremarkable , unremarkable
i am usually a non flavored coffee drinker but i do like to mix things up every now and again this is a lightly coconut flavored coffee the coffee itself is a medium brew and it goes well with the tropical of the coconut it is a nice summer drink ,light coconut flavored coffee , delicious
i love quite a few coffees but this one is grabbing my whole attention it is not bitter but it is not light either it is perfect i love it ,rodeo drive delicious coffee , great coffee
i switched to decaf and was looking for a decent cup on the keurig machine i was only interested in subscribe and save options br br this is a fairly light roast which i like i brew on the middle setting and i think if it was brewed any larger i would think it was too light ,pretty good decaf , good coffee
of all the k cup flavors that are out there and there are many very good ones this is one of my least favorites and i have tried almost all of them not much flavor to this one even if you add various types of creamers of course it is all a matter of taste but this one does not taste all that good it is not bad it is just kind of there like a generic coffee try something else instead ,not my favorite , not as good as it is
absolutely love wolfgang puck rodeo drive k cups it is the best nice rich flavor but not too strong best one yet ,k cup coffee , great coffee
i have purchase this coffee several times my husband said it has a great taste and it is a good cup of coffee ,wolfgang puck coffee rodeo drive blend medium roast k cup for keurig , great coffee
of this freshly made joe the smell would really tempt me to go back to consuming coffee again eventually it broke me down and i am back to being a full time coffee drinker and proud of it imagine how happy i was to find my favorite brew in a k cup the only thing better than a cup of me crazy is a cup sweetened with the new almond joy flavor international creamer in it to highlight the sweet coconut unfortunately we only have a keurig at our office i m in real estate now so i have to go to work to enjoy a cup i am thinking i have a brilliant boss who knows how to get people to willingly show up to work now if i can just figure a way to use it to temp more buyers into our office i would have it made ,jamaica me happy , great product
i bought this grudgingly because my favorite timothy italian blend was out of stock and i was very happily surprised it is not as big and winey a brew as my favorite but was flavorful had a delicious aroma and was smooth i tend to like rather potent coffee but i have clients who prefer a little lighter cup this will be perfect i will happily keep buying this coffee thanks wolfgang ,nice mellow cup of coffee , great coffee
i think this is a love it or hate it kind of coffee i love it the flavor starts out similar to butter toffee but then sort of into coconut pineapple and rum i think it is delicious and unique and i do not ever want to be without some in my cupboard ,so good , delicious
this one will not disappoint i got this yesterday and my husband and i tried it this morning with breakfast and we both loved it i have gotten many different kinds of the k cups to try but after trying this one i think i could be happy with just this one and black tiger for those mornings when i want a really strong cup of coffee the rodeo drive blend is delicious with a nice round feel on the palate and an interesting flavor on the finish with just a hint of smokiness perfectly balanced and absolutely wonderful plus i have to admit i love the label the different color looks very appealing on my with the other k cups ,new favorite , great coffee
we have tried many of the k cups that are available and this is in our top we prefer a darker bolder flavor and this one hits the mark at the same time it is quite smooth ,one of the best k cups , great coffee
my husband i both like a mild tasting coffee we thought we would give wolfgang puck breakfast in bed a try we were pleasantly surprised by the full bodied taste but without the bitterness of some of the stronger tasting coffee we are very satisfied and will be drinking this for a long time now if i can only get my husband to take the name literally ,mild and flavorful , good coffee
this k cup is one of my favorites along with coffee people jet fuel and black tiger if you like a strong rich coffee this will fit the bill ,rich tasting coffee , great coffee
not too strong not too weak smooth without the bitterness great anytime for those not into the strong grow hair on your chest types we will continue to purchase this as a part of our favorite brands ,a winner cup of coffee , great taste
wolfgang rodeo drive does make a good ole cup of coffee it is on the same line as donut shop very good morning coffee to wake up with ,k cup fan , great coffee
the coffee was more on the light side rather than medium roast i do not think i would purchase it again even though it was a good value purchase ,wolfgang puck coffee for keurig , good coffee
i have tried several decaf k and have found this to be the best my husband does not like decaf but has finally found this one he will drink because it has a little bolder taste i find it a good coffee to have in the house for company because everyone seems to like it i will be ordering it again and again ,decaf , not as good as it is
this coffee is for those who like a strong robust flavor nothing wimpy about it i like just enough cocoa mix and creamer to take off the edge my husband goes for the gusto great wake me up in the morning brew love it ,good stuff , not as good as it is
this is an excellent blend perfect for any time was really surprised by the quality flavor and finish ,great coffee , great coffee
as coffee these kcups are just ok as flavored coffee these are disappointing i found the vanilla to be barely detectable ,barely any vanilla aroma or flavor , good coffee
after receiving this coffee i made a few cups it was fairly smooth not too overpowering and had a slight mocha aroma it is ok coffee i likely will not purchase this one again because there are so many better ones to gauge my review for others my favorites are coffee people donut shop green mountain dark magic coffee people organic bold emeril big easy bold and tully kona blend ,ok coffee but not the best by far , good coffee
nice smooth cup of joe high recommend not sure why there is not more reviews ,good stuff , good but not great
this coffee was in a sample selection when we ordered our keurig brewer it was by far our favorite i have ordered this coffee several times from amazon it is a dark roast but not too strong ,wolfgang puck coffee sumatra for keurig , great coffee
you get a consistent cup of coffee with a hint of hazelnut a cup of hot coffee in about seconds that tastes great what is not to like about that ,tastes great , great coffee
these have a stronger caramel flavor although still a medium strength coffee the best caramel flavored k cup i have tried i will reorder them ,best caramel k cup , great product
i want to try other types of coffee but i am so stuck on this one that it is hard to try anything else this is a mild roast medium or dark roast is too strong for me these days the hazelnut flavor it very nice and every cup brewed is superb i have been drinking this wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut for at least months and it never to please give it a try ,love love love this coffee , great coffee
love this rodeo drive it has a very drinkable taste is also good and it is smooth i recomend that you try this one ,one of the better k cups i have tried , great coffee
this is the most delicious coffee ever it does not mess up your stomach it is amazing and tastes wonderful and everyone at work loves it too ,delicious , great coffee
k cups this is the only place i can find them so i hope amazon never stops selling them here they are mellow medium roast and i enjoy them every day any other brand is just a back up try them i have never had any trouble with any of the cups and i am on my third order now of cups if they had a problem they have fixed it br br this is an update being done on july i continue to drink at least two cups of this coffee every day it has ruined me for other coffees as i measure every other cup against this incredible wolfgang puck decaf k cup please please please amazon make this part of your subscription service my head hurts trying to make sure that i always remember to order so as not to ever be out of this wonderful coffee ,favorite , great coffee
i really like medium strength coffee but this is a little too bold to be considered medium it is almost bitter when compared to other medium coffees ,almost bitter , good coffee
great product to start your am with as its not too strong but just the right tast for your morning wake us up ,breakfast delight , great product
this coffee is okay but certainly not as good as green mountain breakfast blend it just does not taste as good ,okay but not great , good coffee
this is a great flavored coffee nevertheless k cups are getting too expensive for everyday home use i am now using the filler and using my own ground coffee much of the time it is also helpful to look for other price alternatives ,tasty but expensive , great coffee
i roast my own colombian beans at home so i have a perfect for reference right off the bat let me say that just like their sumatran reserve this k cup is not bitter but smooth the aftertaste is also smooth my complaint is it does not taste like a colombian bean it really is missing the deep flavor of a columbian coffee while the sumatran puck k cup definitely has a sumatran taste the brand you see in many grocery stores has a more distinct flavor than this k cup that being said my final recommendation is that i would the puck sumatran over this if you like a distinct coffee flavor however if you are looking for a not too stong but not bitter coffee this colombian is a great choice i would buy this again just because of the smooth taste ,great but not perfect , good coffee but not a great price
i have always been drawn to k cup varieties with out there names jet fuel black tiger and distinctive flavors golden french toast spicy chocolate this offering those two features into something i am happy to wake up to br br to me jamaica me crazy definitely got a coconut taste fairly similar to dunkin donuts coconut flavored coffee but it is also got a lot of the flavor characteristics i have come to expect from k cup chocolate brews barely any of that acidic aftertaste that is almost with artificial flavors and definitely not as watery as many other k cup varieties sure the name pretty corny and the taste is hardly subtle or but that is what makes this cup of joe so fun ,spicy , not as good as it is
just like you would the chicken in a general recipe general tofu is awesome the flavor comes from the sauce so you do not need to marinate first br br some people also freeze tofu generally remove from packaging and press first to give it a firmer consistency br br tofu is all about how you prepare it most people will not like it plain so do not expect to just dig a fork into it br br this product is great because of its all purpose nature firm is definitely better than soft for saute etc and its shelf life i would have given it five stars but the must be refrigerated versions packaged in fluid do seem to be firmer they do not last as long in the house though so this is a perfect choice to keep in the pantry usually a few to several months out ,great life very good for use , great product
graham cracker crust you have got a pie or i will add some peanut butter cocoa powder and maple syrup to make a mousse i also like to just add strawberries and bananas and maple syrup for a yogurt i use it to make sour cream and onion dips for vegetables i also like it to make sour cream for mexican food and potatoes my boyfriend cannot even tell the difference also good to make mayonnaise for potato salad i recommend a food processor or blender to really get the smooth creamy texture this tofu is the best stuff on the planet i order the pack of it because i got through or more a week also i like to get the organic because soybeans are typically highly sprayed it is worth the few extra bucks i love this stuff behind my almond milk this is my most vital ingredient ,greatest stuff on the , a great product for the price
my picky kids also love this tofu as well for kids that seem to only want mac cheese they are themselves on much healthier miso soup now this makes me happy by the way i also highly recommend the roland white miso paste incredible flavor and great quality and the soup stock which i both purchased from amazon if interested my miso soup recipe is as follows package of morinu firm silken tofu this stuff tsp soup stock tbs white miso paste cups of water and chopped we also reconstitute mushrooms add dried seaweed highly recommend either eden or from amazon as well add etc however this recipe is awesome just as is we live in california with some of the best japanese restaurants in the world but this recipe blows away or at least equals what you can get from any restaurant but i i highly recommend this tofu ,awesome tofu a great price , great product
i used to eat tofu almost every and i t had those for a while br so i was searching and i was actually surprised that has tofu br i was half curious and half pleased so i bought it and i do not regret it br it organic cheap and does not need to be refrigerated until br i just like to eat these by it self or with soup br i am going to buy this again so good ,very satisfied , not as good as it is
having recently turned vegan i had to buy my supply of tofu this stuff is the bomb i have not done a lot of exotic things with it thus far but i love to use it as a salad dressing potato topper i crack open a brick dump it into the blender add a little vinegar a little soy milk onion power dill tiny bit of celery seed a generous dose of nutritional yeast i blend all that up till it is smooth and then store it in a glad container in the stays fresh for about days i like to just dump this stuff all over my meal of baked potatoes lettuce br br i cannot wait to all the options with this stuff banana pudding may be next ,awesome tofu , great product
chocolate pudding with this stuff a box of silken tofu some dark cocoa powder stevia and then a bit of milk to it up in a blender or food processor and it makes a super creamy delight that i do not feel guilty about eating and leaves me more satisfied than your standard pudding chill it and it becomes a thick luscious mousse making myself hungry br br i love that it is a shelf stable product that i can have on hand for meals br br sometimes i make burgers by mixing it with smoked paprika garlic onion nutritional yeast oatmeal masa flour bit of nice oil until a thick consistency and fry up and they are just fantastic br br i think this is one of those foods that is so versatile and easy to play with and gives you a nice bit of protein to your diet ,wonderful easy to with , great product
following a plant based diet i use tofu almost daily it is expensive to purchase at a store and takes up valuable real estate in my fridge these packages sit perfectly on a shelf they are a little smaller than standard refrigerated tofu oz vs oz they are also silk tofu so they do not hold their shape as well which is good for certain things like fried rice or chocolate mousse not great if you are making tofu steaks or strips ,convenient , great product
recently purchased a case of nu from amazon i would had this tofu before and the product i got from amazon is fine though a word of caution my case only has about months to go on its best by date the date on the box one year from manufacture so this product had been sitting around a while not a huge problem but i will be looking for silken tofu recipes now vegan ice cream to use this up rather than just having silken tofu on hand for a while as i would hoped ,good product but by the date a little old , not as good as it is
we recently started eating vegetarian meals and this product is organic and very solid you will not get a ton of water like you get in store bought tofu you will be happy with the quality and fast delivery ,great product , great product
the texture is a little grainy compared to some other silken it tastes a little weird to me but i got used to it i wish this tofu was made only with instead of and calcium sulfate i am happy to be able to buy the organic online it was shipped well arrived with no problems ,pretty good , not as good as it is
this is much different than the water packed tofu i am used to but i like it a lot i have only made pudding with it so far chocolate chocolate peanut butter banana and next pumpkin but i can see the potential uses and reading other reviews and doing various for ideas mayo sauces dips smoothies really help too i would love to be able to replace mayo with tofu and create a creamy cheesy tofu sauce for mac cheese imagine the calorie savings br br the best thing about this tofu is that it is shelf stable i read on their website morinu com that each pack is on its creation date and is good for one year from that date that is useful info also check their website for recipes and suggested uses each pack has a recipe on it but it is the same for all ,like it a lot , i love it
i use this in place of mayo for many recipes when i need something creamy and quick this also works very nice for sweet dishes as there is very little taste to the tofu and it does absorb flavors well like a chocolate pie ,good product , great product
love these tofu as they do not require refrigeration until the package is open i use tofu a lot in my cooking so have them handy all the time makes it really convenient the price is not too bad for an organic tofu ,so convenient no needed , great taste
good firm texture comparing to other silken firm this is just the right consistency hassle free it is easy to come out from the container tofu shape as is easy to handle and manage rather than crash or it ,good tofu , great taste
i have used this product for many years it is organic non gmo which is a requirement for me as well as the good nutrition analysis ease of use and cost morinu is packaged with a shelf life of months needs no refrigeration and can easily adapt to most recipes and smoothies my pantry is never without morinu organic firm tofu and amazon has the best price ,easy vegan item , great product
island dressing strawberry shakes tofu faux convenient fast long shelf life delish and organic i order several at a time i will also use this product for baking ,vegan , great coffee
i like this brand and think the shelf stable packaging is great since i cannot seem to find the organic version locally it is been delicious in my recipes ,it is good , great taste
palate i place those small flat spinach leaves available in the organic department of your local market perhaps with the results of a small onion diced very carefully in the manner approved as described above or green onion br br when quite ready for dinner i add last of all to this essence this gentle box of tofu sliced as described above with great and tender care leaving it one might dare say only long enough to warm through and through before eating br br a meal in itself br br there are so many other in which to use and to abuse this pure white and utterly nutritious gentle product and i can only with my recommendation say and this with my greatest that here at long last we may know a food most willingly fit for our human consumption and one most readily available upon this wonderful amazon ,at last we find a food for , great product
disappointing while folks like to say tofu has no flavor i can discern a type of and this br one is the of br br wet watery it is not a product i will buy again soon i got it because shopping is br a challenge br br it not awful just disappointing the benefits are the packaging and that is has shelf life ,soft for tofu , not as good as it is
even with the chocolate chunks these bars taste far less sweeter than most granola bars out there and i really appreciated that br br they have calories each and grams sugar which is less than kudos chocolate chip cal sugar or a farms chocolate chip granola bar cal sugar when i need a quick snack i can eat one with a glass of sparkling water and i feel full until the next meal if i need a quick meal i eat one of these with two string cheeses a large apple and water i can make it until dinner br br i would recommend these to anyone looking for a tasty and quick snack ,taste like not sugar , not as good as it is
these tiny candies are as delicious as they are every single kind of them tastes great they are packaged well when i am through the bag i am ordering it again ,delicious and sugar free , delicious
this tea is strong and has a smoky flavor you can feel the though it is not very bitter i think it is a bit expensive for it is but i have not found a replacement i guess we are paying for the fancy packaging which in my opinion is a real waste especially when you go through cups a day like i do green tea is stronger and is pretty good but is available for cheaper than in the local indian stores ,strong green tea , not as good as it is
eye bought this product on a recommendation however eye cannot seem to get past the strange taste yet eye will keep using it to see if this will pass or if eye will acquire a liking to it the package states no bitter taste if it is a sweetener why should there be any bitter taste ,taste , not as good as it is
if you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea you can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the stevia powder br br unlike artificial sweeteners stevia is never bitter and will not leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth the packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods br br by using a low calorie calories sweetener with only gram of carbs you will be ahead of the game every single time you use one packet of stevia you are using less sugar and you will not even miss it br br the rebecca review ,delicious alternative to sugar , not as good as i be
a nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners stevia is made from herb in south america japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said it is quite a bit sweeter than sugar so you need less of it as a replacement br br i like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and t cocoa it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about calories as the stevia is calorie free the stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great refreshing treat for the day br br this multi pack offer for this price is about lower than what i can get nustevia for locally ,great price for great sweetener , great taste
are these people crazy or can i not multiple properly this is for small cups of peaches that works out to for the pack this pack cost about in a grocery store in the states but because i am i am suppose to pay for it not happening com is higher than a store but cheaper than this ,cost too much , great taste
product has a shelf life of two years and was labeled as produced in december of product leaked from seal in carton ,be , great product
the warm scent of italian bergamot and blend it with natural raspberry flavor and swirl it into south indian black tea and what you are creating is a raspberry dream of a tea this tea if made with powdered milk honey or a packet of stevia becomes creamy br br top with vanilla whipped cream and you have a vanilla raspberry bergamot tea this is the perfect for tea parties or sipping in the morning while enjoying a raspberry muffin br br the people who pick the tea leaves are paid a fair and the positive energy really does come through in the flavor of the tea the tea leaves are also organic br br i think this is the most delicious tea i have ever tasted once you try this flavor you will want to try all the flavors i also love the chai br br the rebecca review ,tea , not bad
i love passion fruit juice and this is a very good product each bottle makes about a gallon it is low in sugar and low on glycemic index has a lot of potassium and is a natural makes great too if it is not relaxing enough for you straight up fast delivery and great product ,really good juice , great taste
that sells gluten free stuff and this is no exception if you have celiac this will not make you sick br br even better this is powdered agar agar not flaked agar agar that means this will last for months if not years although it is also easy to use too much tablespoon of the flakes tsp of the powder the ratio most cooks call for is cup liquid to teaspoon flaked agar agar which means tsp of this powder to cup liquid with more added for more acidic things like orange juice br br however agar agar does not gel as well as jell o so do not expect to get the same results that you would for jell o for that you need jell o or kosher gelatin you can add more agar agar to add firmness but then it starts to taste like what it is seaweed ,gluten free vegan and very , a great product
awesome this powder was bought as a replacement for my works farm i have not tried it as a food supplement but mixed with a little food sugar it worked perfectly as gel br br it makes a firm gel clear that holds at room temperature ,powder , great product
i agree with the reviewer who said it will not give you the firmness of jello but it does satisfy my cravings wonderful product ,very good for making , good
i received the agar about days after ordering it comes in a slightly different bottle now but i assume its the same agar agar as before the bottle has a snap lid i m not so sure about the quality of the seal so i keep the agar agar in an airtight container just as a i dont plan on eating any of this but i have used this successfully with experiments in dishes the agar is light enough to see everything well in the dish so it works great for that ,its , great product
agar is basically gelatin for or vegetarians regular gelatin is usually animal based and is made from leftover body parts of animals that would otherwise be thrown away sound appetizing agar is a free alternative and is a great aid anytime a thickened creamy base is required usually in baking i use this for many cream pies as well as other desserts ,great vegan alternative , great product
i bought the lb bottle for use in experiments i have not really eaten any of it yet so i cannot comment on the taste or anything like that br but for growing things it is great br since it is a powder it is easy to measure out use unlike those annoying flaky bars br after the agar sets it is quite clear which is nice ,works well , not as good as it is
not really much to say about the product other than it arrived similar to as pictured and works as described i used it as a natural for icing which was excellent american wholesale got it to me in days i purchased oz usa product ,good price worked well as a food , not as good as it is
i needed this for a no bake cheese cake and i do not use gelatin kind of me out but it worked well for what i needed be sure to read directions ,good , not as good as it is
i have not tried eating it i bought it to make vegan strips it totally works hooray i did not have much luck when microwaving it but if you boil it like it says on the bottle it up quite nicely bear in mind you must add soy milk to make the strips the agar simply does not have the ability on it is own ,excellent , great product
product was great but i ordered paid for lbs received only oz i have been unable to get any response from custom service there is no way to reach the company by phone i just put this credit card transaction into i still want my lbs ,in , great product
we have been looking for a good chocolate sandwich cookie since are no longer being made or sold and famous fits the bill much better than oreos or other types it is sweet the chocolate is distinct and the filling is not too sweet as if it is made of only sugar the amazon price is the best subscribe and save is new and brings the price down to an irresistible buy which is even more special since these cookies are not always at the grocery ,better than , not as good as it is
picture i to see what the soup actually looks like in the bowl the chicken was pretty firm and just right in my bowl the taste is not bad you will not feel like you are in or while you are eating it unless you are actually in or but it has the distinctive taste and is really quite good compared to some of progresso other soups my biggest complaint with this soup is that the green vegetables came out mushy as they tend to with progresso soups i have found the celery and were good just very soft and mushy which is not really what i wanted it did a pretty good job of filling me up though as they pack a whole lot into that can as always overall a good soup that i would not mind buying more of if i see it on the shelves sometime ,pretty good chicken , not as good as it is
this is my favorite progresso soup the broth has excellent flavor and it is not too salty yes the veggies could be a bit firmer but the pieces are large and tasty it has some heat already but i usually add a few shots of hot sauce to suit my taste if i really want to indulge i will up a few pieces of smoked sausage and add it before heating heaven ,a good soup on cold , great taste
i am doing the subscribe and save thing with these crackers i thought that it would take a while to get through the six boxes but boy was i wrong already we are halfway through the boxes time to order more ,addictive and tasty , not as good as
the crackers are very tasty and we just tried them out with a little salsa on top for a healthy low cal snack and my wife and i absolutely love em we will definitely get more once we run out ,great tasting crackers , great snack
i bought duck from amazon because my usual favorite duck rillette was not carried anymore by com i was expecting a really good rillette full flavored rillette what i got was a that lacked even flavor of duck and herbs spices the texture was good however tasted more like a pork rillette i would not recommend duck ,not much flavor , not as good as it is
asking me if i was pregnant i decided to diet but was not easy i was always hungry and at bedtime i could not help it and ended up with a plate of ice cream no good i decided to give this tea a try and i stopped feeling hungry all the time the taste is great i have lost ten pounds in almost two months i walked al least an hour per day i only have fruits and tea in the mornings salad and protein for lunch and fresh smoothies without sugar for dinner if i feel i have a fruit or raw vegetable i put chopped garlic on my salads it gets rid of waste too i dont diet on but my stomach is smaller so i get full with less and less food i am buying this for my sister it has been awesome for me thanks ,awesome , great product
i loved this green tea with acai and grape added to it it made me feel awesome and gave me lots of energy i would recommend this tea to tea lovers who like a bit of an extra boost i think the acai extracts help a lot and made me feel wonderful ,great flavor it gave me lots of energy , great tea
cannot complain taste good and had quick delivery it was my first time trying this tea out i usually drink the peppermint one but this gave me energy and me throughout the day ,very good , great tea
the product description says you are purchasing boxes of tea bags i received only one box i called amazon and they said that the quantity i received was correct and the description is wrong they made it right but should not have had to beware ,product wrong , great tea
i would recommend this tea it has a fresh taste with an amazing acai grape flavor that i have not had before it also gave me energy which i can always use ,the tea is fresh and the taste is great , great tea
rub a br br that said this mix is a delicious treat but it does not hold the attention of the taste buds like the the primary notes are supposedly and smoked paprika but overall the tastes are and do not provide a zing to the dish br br it a very tasty addition on multiple items such as tip and pot roast but not enough to justify the gourmet price it is also too heavy a mix to work well on chicken fish or to drizzle over a meat pasta dish br br note surprisingly the best from chef tom for red meats are either the a href http www amazon com gp product b m chef tom douglas rub with love pork rub a or a generous portion of a href http www amazon com gp product b m chef tom douglas rub with love chicken rub a ,a decent spice for red , i love these
rub that is especially delicious i rub this seasoning on the best i can find then i cook the steaks in a little oil one thing about this seasoning is it is made with brown sugar this means your steak is going to burn a bit unless you keep the heat on medium or lower when i use this steak rub i tend to cook the steaks a little on each side and then i cut them up into smaller pieces and continue frying this that they will not burn to be honest i cannot really taste the rosemary in this mix the peppers are much more my husband loves to eat the steaks with a little tiger sauce he thinks that makes them just perfect i have also tried the salmon rub and the chicken rub and have found them all to be delicious br br the rebecca review ,slightly spicy , best i have ever had
my husband and i found this rub in a little market in a few years ago we have since purchased it since it adds great flavor to steaks that now cannot eat a steak without it it is definitely a must try ,best ever , great product
this steak rub is spectacular i rub it liberally on steak usually ny strip let is sit for a while and then grill it has been getting rave reviews and we are already on our rd jar i wish they would sell it in bigger jars amazon price is a bit high though ,delicious and easy , great product
most important its double so when i poured my boiling hot water in the glass i had no problem carrying it from the kitchen to my and barely feeling any warmth the filter strainer does exactly what its supposed to do which is keep the loose tea out of your mouth while you drink your tea this is the first time i have used something like this and it works perfectly for me br br the blooming tea comes in three small containers i am new to tea so i cannot tell what kind it is most likely some type of jasmine green tea because it smells good the first steeping is very mild but the second one the flavor really comes out anyway i hope this helps people that are on the fence like i was about buying glasses like this this package is and well worth the price ,great great tea , great product
fabulous gift the blooming teas were lovely and unique packaging was beautiful and perfect for a gift ,tea gift , great product
i bought this for my son who travels often he is told me the worked well the blooming teas were good for brews ,great gift , great product
i am so happy to have bought this tumbler it is very handy to have around and works beautifully i whole recommend this product to anyone looking for a convenient tea making device i love the blooming and how you can see them while it brews ,handy product , great tea
just be aware that it is quite expensive for the amount that you are getting less than a pound of pasta per package ,best gf pasta , not as good as
and the expiration date on top of the can says jan i cannot even return it since it is a grocery amazon are you serious ,i just the product , not as good as it
i like to use walnut oil in salad dressings and in baking it is delicious when added to pancakes and muffin mixes in lieu of regular vegetable oil it adds just a hint of flavor without being overwhelming and with the price that amazon offers it for vs what my local grocery store charges for a smaller amount it is a definite bargain would highly recommend ,delicious on and in baking , great product
this walnut oil is the best on the market it has been roasted which enhances the walnut flavor i love it with scrambled eggs and in preparing rice dishes i have even used it to condition my hair i completely trust roland foods because they are superior in every way ,product , great product
i purchased this to use on butcher block which worked fine but when i opened the first can the delightful aroma from this oil had me making a walnut apple that was delicious ,delightful aroma from this oil , great product
this is oil is quite a good value compared to the grocery store prices we always keep a can in the refrigerator ,tasty , great taste
i used this oil for a few years now for almost every recipe it bakes really good in breads and it smells nice and good in salads highly recommended ,my favorite oil , great product
this is an aromatic and tasty oil great on salads or for scrambled eggs br i m sure i will find more uses for this as time goes on free shipping br makes it a great deal my only pick is the lid two of the three br bottles in the shipment had very tight lids that were difficult to open ,great value and taste , great taste
when i bought this food i saw the image and price and assumed that i would be paying a fair price less per bag than the grocery store for low grade cat food the image and price combination led me to think that i would be paying for lb bags a good deal when i received six lb bags i thought there had been a mistake nope so i spend returning it i bought three packs and now customer service tells me they take weeks processing returns my kitties need food now and these people want to sit on my for that long do not buy from these ,overpriced not bags , not as good as it is
if you are looking for a great grain free alternative to beef or chicken this is it my two girls loved it we used to put some in their then put in dry food and then seal the end with more wet food and put it in the freezer so that dinner would become more of a challenge the only con with this food is that it can be pricey as are most wellness products you could probably get the same results you are looking for from a grain free food with something like taste of the wild which is what we have gone to because of cost ,great grain free food , great product
i am on a low sodium diet and use this product regularly think it is very good try their salsa couple of jars of this a couple of jars of another pasta spices seasonings etc however the shipping cost is a major rip off try one of two or three sites on google you will save to a case ,the shipping cost is a , not as good as it is
also the cheapest i use it to make an awesome vanilla latte just put two spoonfuls of the medaglia d oro espresso in a coffee cup and add about shots of hot water and mix place a shot of vanilla syrup in a tall glass more or less according to individual taste next add enough not crushed ice to fill the glass of the way up then fill the glass with enough cold milk to cover the ice the hot coffee mix over the milk and ice and stir until mixed add more ice as needed and then pour enough half and half to color the coffee mix to a yummy caramel color delicious and cheaper than the espresso stands once you have the ingredients on hand is also great in recipes that call for instant espresso not all stores carry this product so i order from through amazon com ,low cost , i love this coffee
i have not bought this online yet i just saw it here for the first time today but i have been buying it locally for almost a year now i originally bought it for a mocha dessert recipe in the south beach diet book i tried it to make a latte and was pleasantly surprised i had not expected much from instant espresso based on past experience with instant coffees this is actually very good i have only used it for lattes and i do not do espresso by the shot i particularly like it when i go camping i have shared it with fellow who also liked it the flavor is rich and can be adjusted to taste by varying the amount per cup it also has a light on top i recommend it highly ,much better than i expected , not as good as it is
coffee maker sometimes this instant espresso is the best i have tried and i have tried about different brands br br not overly acidic at all melts instantly in hot water no sand left at the top if your cup travels wonderfully compact jar and is very to have around for cooking br br i but a tsp in a batch of brownies to the dark chocolate flavor br br i put a tbs in a big batch of chili to compliment the spices and add extra richness br br i add a bit to mexican sauce for punch br br i also put it in chocolate icing chai tea with milk for a java chai latte coffee drink mixes for extra etc br br it is over bucks at some supermarkets when if you can even find it so it is nice to know it is cheaper at amazon ,good and very , not bad
i received a jar of this instant espresso as a gift from my mother in law i was quite at first as i have never used instant coffee of any kind and could not figure out why she gave it to me then this past weekend i was out of coffee beans this was all i had must have coffee in morning so i made it wow it was awesome in fact i am drinking a mug of it right now as i right this review i love it however i make it in more of a latte fashion i have also added hot chocolate to it for a mocha latte i will definitely be looking for it at my neighborhood stores and if i cannot find it i will be getting it here on amazon definitely a great buy ,fantastic , not as good as i have
this instant coffee is a versatile ingredient you can add it to ice cream you are freezing or gelato or or you can add it to chocolate icing to make mocha flavor it is the ingredient to have when the recipe calls for one cup of strong cold coffee br br as a beverage on its own it is a bit more acid than fresh espresso but as a mix with milk it works wonderfully well you will not make a cup of espresso with instant but you will have a great way to make a latte in a pinch and for regular cooking i personally am never without this jar on my shelf ,versatile must have for your , good coffee but not a great price
i prefer this to all other brands and types of coffee even after having lived in italy this is my favorite ,the best espresso out there , great coffee
i was introduced to this product a few years ago and was floored by how tasty and depending on the amount and type of milk added or whole how chocolaty the flavor could even be i have recently moved and do not know where to find it locally so i am trying the online purchasing option i am almost out of it br br this is a very nice option for those of us who do not drink coffee all that often but want to have something of quality in the kitchen cupboard goes great with trader joes hot chocolate powder too ,quick and easy at home , great coffee
i use this for work it is very quick and easy and much better than the coffee they provide br br i do not understand the price though a oz jar at whole foods was well before the date ,at whole foods , great coffee
this is a good product especially for iced coffee but why is it twice the price as it is in stores this is not a fluke within the past two months i have bought it for a jar in seattle and in so it just looks like good old fashioned try harder amazon ,twice the price as in stores , good coffee
this is a great product when in a hurry i am surprised at the price though my store sells it for bottle when i am traveling i can usually find this at mexican markets even cheaper i love amazon usually their products are less expensive than buying at stores ,great product , great product
i have never been a fan of instant coffee so the only reason i purchased this was to use in a homemade recipe the turned out great so i decided to get another jar to have on hand as a tea drinker who has lived for years without a coffee maker it is so nice to have an instant option that tastes great and has a good kick br br delicious ,great to have on , great taste
i am very fond of this coffee and i will not accept substitutes for it several of my local stores have substituted another brand i just order it on line when i cannot get it in a store however amazon price is too high it is a jar in local stores ,great coffee but amazon price is too high , good coffee
i have been using this instant expresso coffee for about a year now i buy it in our local supermarket for a oz jar i originally needed it for a brownie recipe and looked here to purchase but i saw the price and that certainly made me take a ride to the store luckily it was on the shelf and at a very reasonable price only one store in the area it br br check your local stores before you buy this online chances are you will find it at a very lesser price locally i use it now not just in brownies but i add two teaspoons to a protein shake and it makes a great coffee shake br br thank you ,why is the coffee so expensive at amazon , great coffee
is this price for a single ounce jar or for a pack the description only indicates that the price is for ounces which of course is ridiculously expensive but it is a good deal if it is for a pack previous buyers can you please advise the coffee itself is excellent i usually buy it in the store and was hoping to find a deal on amazon ,coffee is excellent price here is for , good coffee
d oro instant espresso works great in recipes i am not crazy about the stand alone taste but did not buy it for that purpose anyway as some have suggested i might have found it at a lower price in a store but looked everywhere and could not find instant espresso in any brand so this order was easy and reasonable ,easy to order great in , great product
i bought this from safeway for about it is awesome in making those homemade iced caramel that cost at starbucks br br i do not know if it is just me but it has this slight chocolatey aftertaste to it that is just absolutely divine ,homemade caramel , not as good as it is
this is really a normal taste coffee i would not buy more after i finish this one in fact i will still be sleepy after drinking two cups ,after , good coffee
i love the strong coffee flavor of this for baking and have been using it for nearly years in my chocolate chip cookies and other recipes br br it also tasty to drink for a portable mix i will use instant dry milk this coffee a bit of unsweetened cocoa and a bit of sweetener then just add boiling water and stir well to make a drinkable instant latte it is not bitter or burnt tasting like some instant coffees can be br br while it does not taste as good as a pulled shot of espresso it is one of the best instant coffees i have ever tried it is ability to mix well into baked goods ensure it is spot in my pantry ,great for baking , great taste
i used to work at that well known coffee shop so i have become a bit of a coffee snob and i never drink instant but if you are looking for a really robust instant coffee that dissolves in cold or hot water and goes great with a little chocolate syrup and cream you will enjoy medaglia d oro i bought it during a run to the store for a few dollars cheaper than i can find it online and much cheaper than a lb bag they sell in the groceries stores ,for those that drink fresh ground only , good coffee
i bought this because none of the instant coffee was strong enough for me and was tired of waiting in line at starbucks i tried it and could not believe it i am so hooked on this product and hope that my local grocery store continues to stock it ,be gone , great coffee
this is a great product but for oz really you can get it from other sellers or at the grocery store for show this price what the market will really bear ,this packaged is over priced , great product
the party i had you send this product to is enjoying it he is unable to purchase this product in arizona obviously certain products are not available in his location and i was happy to help out i want to thank you for your quick response in this request and i am sure he will look to order it in the future thank you ,thank you , great product
i wanted to have an instant coffee for work i do not like the standard company coffee at work i came across medaglia d oro in a heb store in houston it just looks more interesting than coffee i was actually hoping it would not be as strong as espresso but not as watered down as instant coffee i am glad i bought it it has the same consistency at espresso but not as strong in taste i am probably using more water that what is suggested on the directions i work rd so i think it is the bill of keeping me awake true espresso drinkers may think it is kind of weak but it would do in a pinch i will use this for flavoring drinks desserts also ,tasty convenient to make at work , not as good as i be
it was what i was looking for i had a hard time finding expresso instant coffee a little expensive but oh well ,it was just what i wanted , not as good as
i was camping up on the coast and ran out of coffee i stopped at a market in cute sea coast town and bought a jar of this coffee seemed expensive to me until i tasted it wow its totally amazing this is instant why use my coffee maker any more hard to find though i will buy it on amazon absolutely a gourmet treat ,strong flavor for an instant coffee love it , great coffee
i really love espresso i cannot find it in the stores where i live so i have send for it br thank you br mary e ,d instant espresso coffee , great product
i love this item for cooking it is especially good in brownies cakes and just a little bit in hot cocoa is wonderful ,instant for cooking , great taste
this is strong coffee like the italian espresso a teaspoon in a cup is sufficient take care you do not boil the water otherwise it will loses its flavor the water should be between warm and hot i use it black with a small lump of brown sugar a real will tell you that the use of any sugar is but what can i do the is weak ,a for , not as good as it is
i am a coffee snob and this is absolutely a greatest easy way to have excellent coffee got really tired of grinding beans everyday now i discovered this and i am italian so i should know ,the good coffee ever , great coffee
i spotted the brand while watching everyday italian on the food channel i drink it alone as well as adding it to brownies to make expresso brownies wonderful ,wonderful flavor used by italian , great coffee
medaglia d oro has to be the worst coffee i have ever had it had an old flavor and odor you get what pay for ,the worst coffee , good stuff
i of course prefer freshly made espresso but sometimes instant is good in a pinch i travel around europe extensively and there are several brands available there which are not at all bad this brand is ok for using it as a coffee flavoring in etc but as a beverage it rates rock bottom in my book ,this stuff is nasty , not as good as it is
love this coffee good flavor the large quantity lasts longer then the smaller boxes so i do not have to order as frequently it did ship quickly too i would order again ,french roast coffee , great coffee
these arrived very quickly i was excited to see how the pups would like them i like that there are so many in the package i have always held in high regard anything rawhide sweet potato so this was a no brainer our pups love both these sticks are the best they chewing gnawing flavor fun i definitely would buy these again ,a wonderful treat for the , not as good as it is
not quiet what i was expecting the cherries were dried and could not taste the brandy the dark chocolate was good but too crunchy ,mediocre , not as good as
gravy could be a little thicker but the taste is great the price is not bad either makes great steaks and ,awesome , great taste
great stuff wonderful beef taste very smooth could be a little thicker so more of it would stay on top of the potatoes but very good and worlds better than other packaged ,delicious , great taste
this sauce has one of the best flavors i have ever tasted there is a good balance between spice and garlic it has decent heat and tastes good on a lot of things i am not a big fan of most habanero sauces due to the extra bitterness of the pepper but this sauce blends everything perfectly ,great sauce , best hot cocoa ever
roses lime juice has that lime flavor that the knock do not have roses has just the right amount of sugar so that it is not too sweet great for making any kind of vodka or even tequila my favorite since liquor is expensive do not settle for less than the original ,lime juice the original , the best
i purchased this as a because there was no product information listed so i had no idea how much i was getting or exactly what was in it i was disappointed that the large tin was not all that large it was a round tin approximately inches tall and maybe or inches across i was hoping that large especially for the price would be one of the large and tall tins it is difficult to tell from the picture the product itself was good but for the price i was expecting more i would probably buy from them again ,good but not great , not as good as it is
this is the best of the ready made kinds in my experience the powdered kinds are truly awful the other ready made brands taste like pure yellow mustard this one is made with horseradish and no real wasabi but it works well with sushi br br it also makes a great cocktail sauce for shrimp when mixed with plain old ketchup and a pinch of old bay seafood seasoning ,not real but butter than what is available , best ever
this is the only way to eat the customer service is just outstanding thank you so much will do business with them soon ,size for this product , great product
i am on a gluten free diet but even before i learned i was sensitive i loved some of the wow cookies my two favorites are the ginger and the oatmeal which i would rate star because both are fantastic who does not love chocolate chip cookies right i know i always have but the texture and flavor of the wow chocolate chip cookies is just ok in my opinion and my daughter and husband both agree although they are my granddaughter favorite and i am pretty sure if she was over she she would do her own review and it would be star ,good but no to other wow , great product
honestly these cookies could have been better i would buy them again if the shipping was not so ridiculous i think it ended up being like dollars for a few tiny cookies what a ,eh , great snack
these are the best gluten free cookies around the are also great they are great to serve at parties or have for a snack i wish they were a little cheaper but they are worth it ,yummy great for , delicious
this cookies are so good there very close to my home baked cookies but gluten free this cookies are soft which i like in chocolate chip cookies but might be a little chew for some people i think there great very happy ,this are so good , good snack
cats are finicky animals and what one loves another will not touch that is not a on the food itself i have two and their eating habits are very different my local pet nutrition center gave me a sample of prowl the other day and while my one cat absolutely loves it the other will not touch it that is why samples are nice both of my cats have been on evo kibble but this one cat who now loves the prowl has a habit of throwing up and i am on the prowl myself for an alternative food that will help her keep food down so far no she also it up as soon as i have added warm water no waiting i highly recommend you obtain a sample and let the cat decide as the food is economical as well as healthy ,and my cat loves it , cat cat food
i feed prowl because it is a high quality healthy food that does not break my budget it is much cheaper than other premium wet foods wellness etc and my cat seems to like it the only downside to prowl is that since it is dehydrated you must mix it with water and wait minutes before serving my kitten at me the entire time br i started my cat on prowl because my vet offered a free sample she ate it right away with no problems however she would only ever had healthy food so i was not transitioning from an unhealthy grain filled but tasty food br it is very easy to digest and may be a solution for cats with digestion problems i recommend like another reviewer that you order a free sample and give it a try ,less expensive high quality food , my cat loves it
my dogs absolutely love this i have been looking for a natural healthy food to store in my camper in case of emergency last year with all the i decided to load my camper as a quick bug out vehicle for me and my three dogs i have been sealing thier dry blue buffalo kibble but it takes up a lot of room i read a review about this dehydrated dog food from a person takes thier dog camping all time and this was the perfect solution for them and decided to give it a try my dogs let me know its time when i get home now because they are all about this food ,dog , my dog loves them
my dogs both loved this it is easy to fix and very healthy i was already sold on the frozen raw diet for my dogs before trying this one of my dogs has several food allergies this was a healthy alternative suggested to me that i am very pleased with i tried using hot water to speed up the process for my hungry dogs and it worked extremely well definitely recommend this product ,very pleased , my dog loves these
she is not a particularly food dog so i have tried lots of organic natural foods one that she consistently loves is any kind of addiction raw dehydrated food she can barely contain herself while it a bit so much so that i have started using hot water to speed the process along otherwise it is just such while she for it this dehydrated option takes up so little room compared to dealing with cans and as long as she is happy i am happy i try a different flavor everytime i order just to keep her interested so far so good ,my loves it , my dog loves it
i have always wanted to go to a raw diet for my but in its frozen form it took up too much room in our fridge freezer as we travel camp a lot a friend recently told me about addiction and this is the answer for us takes up little space in our cupboard and provides a healthy diet along with a mixture of kibble and fresh fruits and vegetables that our loves he is a very happy camper the cats at home love it too we have only tried brushtail but get the venison treats for variety i am sure we will try the others too for a change up from time to time done in moderation and over a period of time so as not to upset the tummies ,great raw diet food for on the go , my cat loves these
specific flavor from the same company but i will probably use a little of this now and then as variety br br the cats coats look and feel shiny and healthy and they definitely vomit less than when fed more mainstream foods i also mixed it with some straight ground raw meat bone to make sure they were getting plenty of meat the wild brushtail certainly seems to agree with them as a protein source and there are few protein sources that do not make them sick i m limited to chicken turkey rabbit and a small amount of fish usually because the brushtail is wild it is not grain fed and thus should have plenty of the right nutrients also according to the company it is an so this is a responsible way to help the brushtail devour and the animals that live there what is not to love ,even cats love it , cat cats
i started out by purchasing the oz trial package of summer brushtail and my little girl absolutely loved it now i am getting the larger package so we do not run out my chinese suffers allergies to poultry and grains and was pretty much limited to a red meat diet since she is a variety she was on a red meat formula coated in herring oil for her skin the herring left her with fish breath all the time this is a great alternative to the fish because the richness in omega and fatty acids and no more fish breath since she has been on this her skin quality is much better this is also great to mix with kibble if you have a picky little eater like i do just mix a tbsp up in the kibble and you end up with a happy plate every time ,a must try for picky , great for
this is really the best decaf i have tried it is hard to find any better than the italian decafs like this one or illy unless of course you are the average local coffee drinker used to like folgers or to all the and like charcoal brands named for an unknown reason french roast italian roast etc believe me they have nothing to do with french or italian coffee not to mention the local decafs which taste more like tea made out of burned wood ,the best decaf ever , good coffee
i normally drink lavazza expresso made in a french press but in attempt to cut down on my caffeine intake i have weaned my self to decaf while other decaf coffee has given me heartburn or just tasted awful this lavazza hit the spot while it is not quite as rich as the it is still has plenty of rich chocolatey flavor is beautifully smooth and not at all bitter the only downside i have is the price tag and the need to buy it buy the can rather than the vacuum packet its a full more than i pay for the same amount of it is by far the best decaf that i have ever drunk ,excellent decaf , not as good as i have
i have looked everywhere for a decaf espresso for my tried coffee from the grocery store but the decaf was never espresso grind ordered newman decaf espresso grind on line and it was not that great not good flavor for espresso and just ok for cappuccino i tried this on a whim because of the price and the super saver shipping here on amazon and i was floored with my cup it is rich it has flavor the crema is excellent i have signed up for the auto shipment of this and could not be happier i can finally have excellent italian coffee and i do not even have to leave home or go to italy to find it ,it is decaf and excellent , good coffee
finally a great decaf it has a really wonderful and complete flavor not like a lot of the decafs on the market that are just missing the kick i use a super automatic to make my espresso it works lovely in the funnel on this machine since it is pre ground the flavor stands up nice to milk for and lattes this is my every day decaf espresso i have not found anything better and i have tried a lot the illy decaf is in flavor quality but at about double the price the illy just is not worth it ,great decaf , good coffee
lavazza decaf espresso was the best tasting of the leading brands i tried in my classic machine and this pack was the least expensive per can that i found on the internet the grind is not quite fine enough but sec in a cheap non burr grinder produced the correct degree of for a mouse tail and perfect crema ,excellent product and price , not as good as it is
we love this coffee alone or mixed with caffeinated coffee our preference is for dark strong coffee and this is both ,excellent coffee , great coffee
this is excellent espresso and works great in my in a side by side taste test i can barely discern any difference between this and the lavazza variety both have lovely crema aroma and flavor i have been drinking a lot of espresso lately and this excellent decaf allows me to do so without being jittery or losing sleep br br if you are new to making espresso save yourself some stress and start with this one of the to gaining is reducing the yes grinding beans yourself will get you slightly fresher espresso but when there are problems what do you need to fix the grind the roast your the espresso maker once you are with this excellent ground espresso you will be in a much better position to experiment with grinding your own ,excellent decaf espresso , great taste
this is great coffee you cannot tell that it is decaf the flavor is just perfect well balanced not burned like starbucks and makes good crema works nicely with my espresso cappuccino machine i bought two four packs already and going through my th jar at the moment ,great coffee and i am very picky , great coffee
i have been using this coffee for several years and i am quite satisfied for a decaf it is rich and satisfying a robust taste for the early morning one of the best decaf coffees i have tasted ,decaf espresso ground coffee , good coffee
when it comes to flavors in a good cup of espresso coffee it is all in the way how the beans are roasted the robust flavor of this coffee should make the most espresso lovers proud and it has a little secret which most of us italians would not admit in public it is decaffeinated wow a double i have been using this coffee for several years now and no other decaf pre ground coffee comes close ,it is hard to believe that this is , not as good as it is
this is simply the best decaf for making espresso money can buy at a fraction of the cost this coffee beats everything else out there including illy try also the regular variety and crema e gusto they are all well worth the money note this coffee should be used only for making espresso of course you have to know what you are doing as well ,perfect espresso , great coffee
i thought i did not care for decaf espresso since it always had a bitter flavor that ranged from a moderate undertone to an overwhelming bite i enjoy strong flavored coffee but bitter coffee is another story br br well it turns out that i was just drinking the wrong stuff lavazza decaf is absolutely delightful strong full bodied but no bitterness nice crema smooth and rich really hits the spot br br it does however have a bit more caffeine than other decafs not much but i can feel it a bit i m very sensitive to caffeine if you are not you probably will not notice it not enough that it causes a problem but even if it did i would probably still drink this it is that good br br highly recommend ,me into an espresso lover , not as good as i have
i would prefer to drink the regular lavazza all the time but when i cannot handle the caffeine i use this it is a very good coffee ,a solid decaf , great product
my hubby i love lavazza our absolute fave this decaf espresso is just as good as the regular i can now have it every day again without worrying about my going up amazon you are awesome from the time i placed my order it only took days for me to receive it subscribe save is a great service too i will remain a loyal customer for life ,amazon you rock , great product
i usually order bustelo decaffeinated coffee and i am used to the taste being the same as regular espresso i tried this lavazza decaf espresso and i am extremely disappointed it is really obvious when you taste it that it is decaffeinated and tastes like it is processed i ordered the pack and would really like to send back the three that i have not opened yet if i can do that ,tastes , not as good as it is
i know nothing about this co method of but thought i would give this a try i usually buy the swiss water processed this had a wonderful chocolatey taste it also claimed to be free hopefully this is all true because it really is the best i have tried of decaf ,delicious taste , not as good as it is
excellent quality product which reminds me of italy without the caffeine perfect for after dinner without the effects of too much caffeine ,decaf espresso , great coffee
i have always enjoyed the decaf at a little italian restaurant in our area i noticed that their deli sold lavazza and i asked if that is what they brewed for the restaurant and was told yes i immediately went to amazon and ordered and i am not sorry what a great price for an excellent cup of coffee now i get the restaurant flavor without spending the restaurant price ,just like at a , great coffee
very smooth and rewarding to have a decaff that does not bite the taste buds simply an enjoyable coffee ,for you , good but not great
this espresso is delicious it is strong but not too strong and full bodied and it is terrific for making cappuccino this brand is probably my favorite ,smooth to the last , delicious
this decaf is ok it is a medium roast not a dark roast says it on the can but not in the description here also unlike another reviewer i think that it is ground very fine ,decent , good coffee
i have tried many of the lavazza blends as i must have my morning cappuccino and cannot be without a good espresso blend my hubby only drinks decaf and we have found this blend to be just as good as the regular blend lavazza many times i blend it and for a late day pick me up would not be without it ,perfect every cup , great coffee
i am not an espresso snob i may roast my own beans for drip coffee but when i am making espresso it is generally going in a bunch of milk and syrups br br i purchased the lavazza because i was out of the decaf i would purchased at the store and the lavazza was a good deal for my purposes this is completely adequate and does a fine job at the same time i placed this order i also ordered some lavazza non decaf espresso which frankly does not seem to be as good as the illy i have been using for half the price though i can probably suffer through the decreased quality br br if you are drinking it straight probably not a good choice if you are mixing it it is more than adequate ,good value for money , good coffee
i recently visited paris and when i came back to the states i could not drink the coffee so i found a french website that had some great brands but it cost and arm and a leg to send them here lavazza was one of the italian coffees on the french website and i found it here on amazon so now i can have excellent espresso for a decent price thank you amazon ,best coffee ever , good coffee
i just used this to make myself an espresso and it was one of the best tastes of coffee that i have ever had i was absolutely surprised but it was sooo good i cannot wait until the morning so i can have another cup or two yum ,better than pricey coffee coffee , great taste
i buy lavazza regular espresso in the black can pretty regularly as i consider it the smoothest tasting of all in the supermarket br this decaf in the green can is just as good but lacks the kick of caffeine br br one reviewer loves bustelo well it is a matter of taste i found bustelo to be harsh and unpleasant br c est la ,it is a of taste , not as good as i be
this is the coffee that our friends who are originally from italy use every day they highly recommend it they also use lavazza crema e aroma coffee beans pound bag i have had both of these at their house and both kinds are excellent we get it using the subscription option which gives you a great discount and free shipping ,great coffee , great coffee
i looked all over town and could t find any decaf expresso fortunately amazon provided me with the lavazza alternative and it was a tasty and welcome experience the can is pop top so no cut fingers the product is tasty it is a win win situation i highly recommend lavazza decaffeinated ground coffee ,good decaf espresso , good coffee
we have only used this once but it kept us awake most of the night we were surprised because it is decaf but we could not sleep for hours after going to bed tastes good though ,decaf espresso , great taste
i was but left the color of the bean grounds says it all a light brown not the typical dark brown to black of real espresso even decaf taste is weak and odd not rich and solid certainly not worth the extra recommend cafe bustelo instead ,just not real espresso , not as good as it is
here at amazon and on other sites i used reviewers comments to base my decision to purchase it i am a lover of starbucks espresso decaf coffee i have my own breville espresso machine at home i have been using starbucks for years my coffee arrived and i was eager to give it a try i opened the tin to find brown coffee while i already knew i would be disappointed because i already know i prefer black coffee beans to brown while it pulled a decent looking cup i put it to my mouth only to find it did not match my tastebuds one sip was all it took for me to hand it off to my husband so my verdict here is if you are like me and enjoy only black bean coffee do not buy this product if you prefer brown bean coffee give it a go ,nothing like coffee , great coffee
t may be expresso grind but if you are expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee for your espresso maker think again bitter when drunk on own marginally better when combined with milk in i known ,do not be by the espresso , not as good as it is
the jelly belly people actually put real licorice in these jelly beans there is usually only one of the licorice beans in a bag of assorted beans so if you love licorice you can buy them solo these are authentic tasting and really good you cannot beat jelly belly for flavor ,the black bean , delicious
i have met the creator of the jelly belly and i can report with full confidence that this is one tasty licorice jelly bean a jelly belly is smaller than jelly beans and that is why liked them so much my personal favorite flavor is licorice stars ,this is an amazing jelly bean , delicious
these jelly beans were very unusual when they showed up they came in a package without a jelly belly logo the jelly beans themselves had no jelly belly logo and i do not really know if they were actually jelly i got them as a gift so i did not try any of them but it was odd giving a gift where it did not seem like they were anything special like i would bagged up some licorice jelly beans from the grocery store or something big so i was disappointed and because they were a gift i had no idea what they tasted like so were they really jelly who knows i felt silly giving them though ,not what i thought , not as good as i be
just because i sent an order of these jelly beans br to my oldest son in he travels br a lot and enjoys a snack while he is driving and br he loves licorice jelly beans br br this would make a nice gift for any special person br in your life ,jelly belly , good for you

my dog loves these small biscuits plain she loves playing with them and then eating them i tried the fancy flavored ones and she seemed to not really care for those then i bought some more of the plain small biscuits and she was happy again they help keep the teeth clean and to freshen the breath they have minerals and vitamins they add some variety to her diet i am very happy with this product ,my dog loves these , my dog loves these
my package was mailed out st and received on the rd in perfect condition the tap fit the with no trouble or leaks and is very easy to operate i had a few questions i emailed and received answers fast by the owner the gallon box of syrup is much smaller than i thought it would be about the size of a medium cheese cake box what i do is drain syrup into a washed out container and store it in the fridge the syrup cap has in it bottom second and top the top is oz so you would fill it to that times just remember after you water you remove oz of water or the liter bottle will over flow when adding the oz of syrup gallon are a good way to test if this is right for you before paying high price for the gallon ,real diet dr pepper , not as good as it is
it is not cheap probably a little overpriced but very high quality ingredients no meat by products ,my cats love this product , not as good as
vendor shipped promptly and the product arrived in excellent condition this is an extremely well made product containing no grain fillers i had to purchase the entire case not knowing if my feline would even like it it would have been nice if the vendor would allow sample purchases of select varieties rather than an entire case ,canned cat food , great product
i would not buy this particular yogi tea again because i hate the taste of licorice anise the flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which was not what i was hoping for with my burning throat i think a better blend would be something with more heat like ginger which is why i usually drink yogi cold season instead for the same purpose br br with a sore throat its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea did not do that ,one flavor that did not work for me , not as good as i like
are the predominant form and are the type found in the quaker oats box or granola steel cut oats are associated with and are basically oats that have been chopped into even sized pieces ground oats associated with are just that ground into relatively fine pieces these crackers are made with ground oats olive oil wheat flour wheat bran skim milk solids salt and baking soda note that there is no sugar and that salt is listed at the end these are not the kind of cracker that you eat plain although i enjoy them that way but instead are designed to be used as a base for a or served with a bit of jam if you want sweetness these are simple oat cakes that may not appeal to the american taste buds accustomed to sweet flavored salty crackers they are delicious and wholesome and make a good snack ,these are not but are very good , not as good as i be
in spite of this product being named cajun style please do not worry about it being too hot it has just the right amount of flavor not too overpowering and not too bland i fried some with it and a family friend said it was the best fish he ever tasted br br a suggestion for those who like really crispy fish is to combine the product with corn meal before frying i use a ratio br br buying it this way from amazon is a money saver because of the free shipping and amazon great price i saved about a box compared to buying it from the supermarket also having it shipped to me is much more convenient br br i fully recommend golden cajun fish fry mix i believe you will be pleased buying it from amazon ,love it , not as good as i be
i ordered this for my birthday i got birthday money from family and i ordered a couple of goodies perfume and this cocoa i love hot chocolate and i am always looking for new ones to try based on the first review i decided to go ahead and order i will probably not reorder mixed by itself into hot water it seems to lack thickness it also has too much of an artificial raspberry taste i like hershey bliss raspberry chocolate much better i have been adding one spoonful of the kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost but by itself it does not stand up to the test i plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa ,on the of good but something , not as good as it is
kitchen irish creme hot cocoa mix has got to be the most tasting cocoa on the market we originally bought this cocoa to use as a base for but quickly decided it was way to good to waste in a mix the flavor is rich and smooth we have made it a part of our down for bed time procedure a couple of cups together and just relax br br kitchen to the cocoas as delicious and decadent and they are being extremely ,there is good and then there is wonderful , great hot cocoa
after several less successful stews with curry powder i turned to this curry sauce mix br it is incredibly easy to get delicious curry stew with simple food only with my basic cooking while the way of cooking curry in br though it is my that good cuisine should be made from scratch but his time i just to its convenience to get exactly the taste i want with such a simple process br one small problem is that it is too mild for me though it is labeled medium hot ,very easy to get what i want , best ever
my first time having curry rice br br but boy i cooked this stuff exactly how you are supposed to br br taste t bad i guess a little strong though br br it was thick like ice slush it was over bearing and the spice was pretty intense br br i do not think i will get it again i guess it is good stuff seen it in some curry making used often but not for me as it it is way to thick br br i had potatoes onions and pork prepared to perfection mixed with it and i could not taste them at all i could not taste the pork or anything only the sauce ,way to thick yuck , not as good as it is
we tried this formula because it is lactose free my baby does not have any other issues just lactose intolerant br we found that it smells bad does not mix well into water and my baby would not drink a drop ,disapointed , best popcorn ever
my baby has not died yet br br if your baby has food allergies and your doctor this stuff and you love your baby it is certainly worth every penny as expected my daughter is still alive and she is doing well ,it did not my baby , great product
these are the best chocolate chips i have ever tasted in my life yes they are pricey but it does not matter because they last forever and you use about half the amount of the regular ones due to the richness of them so so so good if you love chocolate you will love these chips ,buy these now , great chips
craving another piece second one was just as good third and fourth followed pretty quickly as well if you like your caramels super chewy and soft then you do not need to refrigerate these i did not refrigerate the first four pieces the second four i stuck them in the fridge overnight the next morning i had one as a pre coffee snack i could not have just one at a time and i ate my second one soon after the refrigerated ones were just as good if you like your caramels a little harder unfortunately since i down this bag so fast my stomach is not happy with me and i am unhappy as i have no more caramels if you are craving caramels do not want the sugar do not mind the maltitol effects and can be content with one caramel a day then these are for you ,ate all pieces in hit the for stomach not so happy , good but not great
makes the best sugar free candy available so many sugar free candies are overloaded with and that has its side and after effects these don t ,best sugar free candy , best stuff ever
we found these sugar free caramels to be delicious a pinch of sea salt the buttery sweet flavor br price is a little high but worth it for the quality ,yum , delicious
the quality of this tea is star it is in sealed bags we are trying it out to see if helps our skin ,very fresh tea , great tea
the pack is a great gift idea because omaha steaks packages them in two boxes of this makes it cheaper than the pack if you are buying more than one quantity omaha is always fast at shipping too though i have had other omaha steaks products i have only purchased these as gifts so i cannot comment on taste ,great price great gift , delicious
these steaks came out really good but the bacon does not have much flavor and does not seem to add to the steaks the size of the steaks are perfect though and i would recommend it unless you are looking for a lot of bacon flavor ,are ok but bacon does not have much flavor , good but not great
after purchasing these steaks for myself i found then to be so easy to store and very tasty when bbq d i decided to share them with my family and friends as gifts they just loved them ,good tasting and great gift , great taste
good idea but the company should use a better soil maybe darker it is hard to tell if the soil is wet or dry present blows away when i water it finally sprouted and i will to a regular top soil when it grows more at least with soil you can tell when it is dry right now i will give it small amounts of water weekly until that happens very disappointed with this product ,plant in a can , not as good as it is
my grandchildren love the sour gummy vitamins they really liked the sour gummy worms by but alas i cannot find them these were a good second choice the big problem is keeping them from eating more than ,a hit , great taste
i was glad to know that amazon has this product in their groceries section br though the shipping was individually priced do not know whether there was any option to pack the glass jars br anyway i liked the fast service ,excellent service , not as good as it is
from taste to texture makes the best pasta i have ever eaten i will never buy cheap grocery store brand pasta again ,wonderful pasta , best ever
guy for a little injury he had these zukes make it real easy to give him the pill since they are moist we just put the pill inside and press it all around the pill that way he does not even know he is taking it trying to give him pills with the wellness treats does not work so well since they are dryer br br edit september br br anyone else notice that they seem different the last couple packs we bought were dryer and brittle they also were not as potent as the other ones were he does not seem to like them as much any more i do not know if the bags we bought were partially opened so they dried out by the time the were delivered or if their recipe changed i will buy some more and see how they turn out a little disappointed ,the price is right , great product
i have a mini poodle he cannot chew biscuits or rawhide textures but these treats are soft enough and still provide some workout for his gums and remaining teeth br i appreciate the fact that the ingredients are domestic and it is manufactured in the us ,safe easy to tasty for dogs , great for
my golden retriever loves them you can them into squares if you want smaller treats ,treats , great for
these are not the tough durable jerky that i was expecting but small soft chewy squares they break up easily into tiny bb sized balls maybe per square and my puppies will do anything for them best training on the market ,better than or , good but not great
my dog loves the how these treats smell and taste they are special treats for her they are healthy mildly chewy low calorie treats so it is perfect they are a good compliment to her regular chicken jerky treats from creek ranch br i usually each into or pieces while training ,healthy tasty treat , my dog loves these
my soft coated wheaten terrier loves these treats they are his special treat that brings him back in a heated run when we call him ,good dog treats , dog treats
our dogs love these healthy treats i like them because they have no wheat corn or soy in them the soft squares make a nice sized treat for our little girls notice that the first ingredient is lamb an luxury for a dog treat ,on the lamb , my dog loves these
used to buy in different packaging light blue with a see through dog shape against a grass green background unfortunately it was completely not the same thing these treats were actually like jerky tough and brittle i give my dog soft treats because he does not chew the damn things and he on these horrible things i had to toss them out br br note that the zuke jerky naturals with the other packaging http www amazon com zukes jerky naturals beef dp b have always been moist and soft and i have never had a problem with those i suspect that this batch was not new packaging as i had thought but very old packaging these may be the same treats i usually feed my dog just having sat on a shelf for years in any case these were completely different treats and not safe to feed my dog ,and , not as good as i like
i am constantly looking for healthy dog treats that are not crazy expensive these are one of the better deals i could find when considering cost ounce my lab absolutely loves them and they are good for him too the treats are soft and moist which is a plus for my dog they could easily be broken into smaller pieces but i generally just give my dog a whole one when he does something good i would not keep them in my pocket because they do smell a bit it is not an overly offensive smell but strong enough that you do not want to carry it around with you all day br br i definitely recommend these for all dogs ,loves them , my dog loves these
these treats are one of my dog favorites i like this company they make a lot of great treats and the ingredients are from the u s ,great treat , my dog loves these
we normally do not buy expensive treats tend to stick to dry biscuits but we got these for all of the family dogs as stocking stuffers for christmas they were a huge hit our dog is willing to do anything imaginable to get one of these my boyfriend mom who totally her had not seen these before and her dog loved these like crazy as well so she went out bought a bunch more when they ran out also they are natural and there are no ingredients so they are good for your pooch br br just to these do not actually have the consistency of jerky they are little squares of what looks like pressed meat product clearly our dogs do not care and consume these with great enthusiasm so still very highly recommended ,dogs love these , my dog loves these
have never made him sick no matter how many he eats during a training and he goes absolutely nuts when he me open the bag br br i ve purchased the smaller sized treats by zukes but they seem to be harder and are too big to offer a small dog as a treat yet too difficult to split into smaller pieces so i find the square shaped ones to be much easier to use for training br br they can get hard if the bag is left open so you need to make sure to close the bag immediately i read another poster mention that putting a damp paper in the bag will the moisture to the treats so i will have to try that if i forget to close a bag which happens br br overall a healthy and practical treat i am really glad i found these ,the only treats i will use , my dog loves them
my pooch loves these treats he will do trick or just to get his zuke br seriously these things will make your dog do anything so buy two bags ,candy for dogs , great treat

my dog is very picky to say the least he is super cute but is very picky about treats he will not eat any biscuits does not like most fake meat treats and will not eat bacon because of this he has hurt many an eager pet shop feelings however he loves these treats we just adopted him from the shelter and his previous owners did not teach him much these treats are making training so much easier he will do almost anything for them br br they re pretty big so you can rip them up into much smaller pieces they will dry out if you leave the package open so they have to be sealed each time br br i know i am most of the other reviews when i say this but these are fantastic treats ,my picky dog loves these treats , my dog loves these
my dog loves these treats in all varieties they are easy to break in half as well the resealable bag is a plus ,my dog favorite treats , my dog loves these
if your dog likes naked bars then this is the same consistency it is hard and sometimes my dog will eat it he will just leave it it is quite hard ,not happy about this , my dog loves it
great i have a dog who is very allergic to lots of stuff and this is safe for him because of no grain corn wheat etc the dogs love the taste i use them for training br ,treats , great for

the lamb jerky soft treats are the first product we tried from zuke they were a big hit and continue to be one of my little favorite treats br soft jerky squares approx can easily be split into pieces we use them for her training play sessions and she seems to especially love it when the reward is the zuke soft lamb jerky br although she performs just as eagerly when the reward is the a href http www amazon com gp product b c zuke ounce mini bakes dog treats peanut butter n a or the zuke mini bakes chicken n cherry so i guess we are with zuke ,lamb jerky treats up , my dog loves these

it is difficult to tell from the pictures and the description but these are not really jerky dried strips of meat but are smallish moist chewy treats made from meat and other ingredients i suppose meat goop formed into a shape think vs a potato chip anyway our dog seems to approve not sure it even touched the sides the beef lamb and salmon varieties she tried all disappear in the blink of an eye a tasty treat for your dog made in the usa but just not the jerky i was hoping for ,not really jerky , good for you
under the product features it says all meats are sourced in the usa i got the lamb and rice jerky today and it says on the package the lamb comes from new zealand that is a huge of this product on the product page very disappointed ,lamb not in like says , great product
my chihuahuas like this treat but they do not eat it with enthusiasm they hesitate and let it sit quite often ,ok but not something they eat with , good
this blueberry and vanilla tea is excellent i love all kinds of tea and friend gave me some of this blueberry and vanilla and a couple other varieties they are all great but this is one of my favorites the blueberry vanilla taste is delicious but not overpowering i usually add milk and sugar to my tea but this one does not need it i highly recommend it ,excellent tea , great tea
bought through amazon as snap bits are difficult to find in pet stores my dog is on a diet and the only treats she can have are few cheerios baby carrots cut into little pieces and yes she eats them and ice cubes snap bits are her extra special treat and she knows when they are in my hand she really likes it when i roll one along the floor for her to chase after and it down ,excellent choice for my dog special treat , my dog loves these
these are nice little training treat sized cookies that can easily be gobbled by my and lb dogs i imagine they would work good too for the smaller dogs as a more regular sized treat they are about the size of a each ,another product my dogs love , great snack
very light in taste but very also very fast service i really enjoyed this i would order this again ,tea , great taste
i am a huge coffee drinker and love the k cups for making one cup quickly before leaving for work in the morning while there are many choices i prefer a bold strong coffee first thing in the morning wolfgang puck french roast is absolutely delicious strong and not at all bitter and makes a great first cup of coffee i would highly recommend to all bold coffee drinkers ,absolutely delicious coffee , great coffee
we always drink or emeril thought we would try something different not too many decafs to choose from we were pleasantly surprised that this had a great taste with a full bodied flavor i like my coffee on the milder side so i can even get cups from kcup ,yummy , not good
good subtle flavored coffee for the mid afternoon pick me up a bit of sweetness without being overdone wish it was available in whole bean as i like it stronger then the keurig cup can make it ,good stuff , good coffee
wolfgang puck chef reserve colombian dark roast is basically what they said it will be dark roast but not too strong acidity is on a low side but with plenty of pleasant taste at the same time you can drink this coffee black w o the need for the sweetener and or milk this coffee is in european tradition and will please many people i would recommend it after dinner but not if you need a jolt to wake you up ,what was , not as good as i have
they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee br br there now you know br br my mom goes for the extra only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over years now and she is frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck or rather mine since i buy it for her br br unfortunately out of all the extra bold k cups she is tried she claims that the wolfgang puck is the tasting she is tried it in both the medium small serving sizes format and both have produced less than full flavor drinks br br if you are looking for a rich flavorful strong tasting coffee try the a href http www amazon com gp product b hkzz a van houtte cafe medium roast extra bold coffee count k cups for keurig brewers pack of a ,my this was not as flavorful as other extra , great coffee
this coffee brews very weak like a light roast w p chef reserve pods are just over half full put pod on scale and it is less coffee than normal pods stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee ,weak even on small cup , good coffee
i wanted to like this coffee i did we have tried other wolfgang puck k cups and have been pleasantly surprised this just did not impress us bitter aftertaste and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor smells great while brewing but just does not live up to it in the cup i am really disappointed because i now have a box and a half of this product that we really do not want to drink great price though ,really disappointed , not as good as i be
i purchased these for my mom and she loves them she does not like bold coffee flavors but is more into the sweet and more flavorful varieties this one combines the taste of the islands with a smooth nutty flavor amazon had a great price on these and this is something that i can actually recommend ,drink the of , good for you
this is a good decaf coffee but i have never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup it is extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess ,great taste cup , great coffee
warning this is a strong flavor br br i thought that this would be blue mountain y oh no it is like rum flavored or something yuk ,if you want a flavored coffee okay but yuk , not as good as it is
i admit i do not usually drink decaf but this is a favorite in my office and i felt it deserved a good rating ,a favorite at the , good coffee
this wolfgang puck coffee tasted great the vanilla flavoring is just right some reviews said it was not so good not enough flavoring etc do not pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here i have never posted for a product and i have tried many different k cups this is a good k cup and do not hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback i almost hesitated and did not buy it and then i figured i would give it a shot it was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor you will enjoy it it tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor ,just right and you will love it , great coffee
i saw the good reviews of this jamaica me crazy coffee but the reviewers all seem to around whether it has coconut vanilla caramel rum or coffee flavorings br br first off i am not getting any coconut from it at all some vanilla but it mostly tastes like coffee with irish cream in it br br in fact after i drank a cup i had to go pick up my son from kindergarten and it occurred to me that some of the other parents might think i was drinking coffee while we waited for the class to let out br br but its good i recommend it to anyone who likes flavored coffee not really anything else like it and i have tried about different k cup flavors ,good coffee but up the flavors , good coffee but not a great price
with so many choices now i thought i give this a try br the donut shop decaf is by far my favorite and this one falls short ,not the best , not as good as it is
i used to do the subscribe and save with the timothy world kona but due to the fact that the price on timothy jumped so high i went to wolfgang puck breakfast in bed pleasantly surprised and i must say that i like this one much better than the kona it seems much more smoother but the taste still retains a nice warm mellow bold flavor great way to start the day oh and i love the name of this coffee ,very smooth not acidic , good coffee
what i usually buy so i thought i would try something new i normally drink coffee people donut shop which is a nice strong cup of coffee this was a little disappointing it is called a medium roast but when i brew a large cup my keurig has size options it looks like strong tea very light in color it makes a very weak cup of coffee when i brew the smallest cup possible it is a tiny bit better but i prefer a large cup of strong coffee think i may try the rodeo drive or sorrento but this one is just too weak and light for me oddly enough the first time i tried donut shop i thought it was too strong as i had been used to weaker coffees now that i have started drinking the stronger varieties it is hard to go back to brown water ,too mild for me , not bad
i was not expecting this one to be so rich or full yet it has a smoky finish that is typical of a french roast but does not taste burnt i think alot of times a french roast tastes thin and yet bitter instead of full and smoky but not this one very pleased with it and will definitely order again if you like a stronger cup in the morning without being bitter give this one a try ,a must have on my , not as good as it is
very good product but i need to use it the setting on my b to really enjoy the depth ,wolfgang puck columbian , great
as a french roast fan i bought this brand of k cup with high expectations considering the name attached to it i was disappointed it has a hearty aroma and full bodied flavor but leaves a bitter aftertaste br br if you are a lover of the more robust roasts i would recommend trying the a href http www amazon com gp product b l y a coffee people kona blend island style extra bold k cups for keurig brewers pack of a instead it is a smooth blend with none of the bitterness that delivers that kick you are likely looking for ,a strong yet bitter brew , not good
not too bold not too weak not bitter good way to start if your not into the real strong coffees my husband and i have added the wolfgang puck breakfast in bed line and the rodeo drive flavors to our buying ritual ,definitely a good breakfast , not good
this flavored k cup is not out of this world but is not horrible in my opinion it is way more flavorful than the wolfgang puck hazelnut k cup we love flavored coffee in our house and so i would go with this one again worth a try ,decent , not bad
never had hawaiian hazelnut before so i did not know what to expect but it turns out it is pretty good not as flavored as say dd but nonetheless pretty good i have it on subscription now along with the german chocolate cake another one of my favorite flavored k cups ,than expected , not as good as it is
this has made me into a coffee lover very mild and easy on the stomach but with a great flavor love it ,breakfast in bed coffee k cups , great coffee
nice light cup of coffee definitely not a bold brew but it is smooth and gentle on the stomach good for those mornings when you over did it the night before would buy again ,enjoyable cup of coffee , good coffee
this is a very balanced and smooth light coffee great for a first cup of the day ,smooth and light breakfast coffee , great coffee
this is a great cup of hazelnut coffee smooth and balanced with no chemical aftertaste my husband and i like it so much that we have ordered it twice directly from the keurig manufacturer so glad that it is now available on amazon through subscribe and save ,wonderful coffee , great coffee
i am amazed how many are being so easily fooled what you are seeing is a generic ingredient list that covers multiple coffees what it is saying based on the photo i see above is that if the coffee type you have is straight coffee then all it contains is arabica coffee but if what you are drinking is a flavored coffee then the ingredients in it are arabica coffee and flavorings but if what you are drinking is a decaf variety then it contains arabica coffee that has been decaffeinated with acetate as is standard br br so if you are not holding a decaf variety then there is no decaffeinated beans it is nothing more than generic catch all ingredients that apply to variety you happen to be looking at br br think people lol ,it is not decaf people , not as good as i like
nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored i am still not sure what flavor it is some type of nut i wrongly assumed that jamaican coffee would be similar to the blue mountain coffee which jamaica is known for how silly of me to assume that i hate flavored coffees so i was so disappointed to now own boxes of such a horrible coffee it only says flavored very small on the box so i did not notice it before i opened it hopefully i can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee flavored coffee for myself ,flavored coffee , not as good as i be
no where in the description does it mention that this is a flavored coffee by the name i thought it was a jamaican blue mountain blend but its flavored with a weak tasting hazelnut not very good ,misleading , not as good as it is
i was in a hurry and did not read the reviews i trusted amazon description and it did not indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was not jamaican it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad i feel cheated ,non flavored coffee beware , not as good as it is
i thought this was a jamaican blend or roast but turns out it is simply a heavily flavored coffee the flavor tastes artificial like fake maple syrup flavoring we have three coffee drinkers in our house and none of us could get past the first few sips now i have to find a home for the rest of it so it does not go to waste ,flavored not for us , not as good as i be
i wish amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be as such then folks who really dislike coffee this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee this stuff tastes the way i imagine newman own extra bold coffee would taste with spoiled irish cream dumped in it nasty shudder ,not at all just another sweet flavored coffee , not as good as it is
i drink about to cups of coffee every morning i am always looking for a new flavor so i gave it a try i drank it but i would not order again ,great name but i did not care for it , not as good as it is
i like strong but smooth coffee this coffee is strong enough but a little on the bitter side for my taste i have tasted other strong blends that i like much more my husband who likes a medium roast coffee is ok with this coffee but it not his favorite either i would only recommend it to someone who likes a little tang in their morning cup of joe ,good but not my favorite , good coffee but not a great price
now and i have tried lot of coffee during that time i have had an occasion k cup that did not function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds br br i probably should have returned these before i bothered to open the second box since i drink my coffee from a cup i can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks br br i have had to throw out at least cups of coffee its a bit like russian and i have started it after i brew it br br i know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the green mountain timothy or tully that i also use the good cups are a bit weak for my taste but the flavor is ok definitely prefer not to waste on a product with a manufacturing defect ,these k cups have issues coffee not bad , not bad but not bad
rodeo drive is my absolute favorite and i am ready to order more that is if i can find it br i do not know why they are discontinuing it br it arrived very fast ,rodeo drive is crazy good coffee , good coffee
honestly i have to admit that i expected a little better that is not to say that this is bad coffee in fact it is quite bold without being too acidic and pretty satisfying overall i think my main problem is that wolfgang puck name is attached to it so perhaps it set my expectations a little high i have a wolfgang puck knife set that i adore and is very high quality for what i paid for it this coffee was on sale so it was well worth it also i just hoped for something that would knock my socks off which it didn t i also purchased the breakfast blend and jamaica me crazy at the same time the breakfast blend was the best in my opinion and the jamaican coffee smelled the best but was the least successful ,good but not wolfgang puck good , good but not great
the breakfast in bed coffee from wolfgang puck is a good medium roast coffee my husband the regular coffee drinker of our house likes it but feels he would like the coffee more if it were a bit stronger the product arrived quite soon after ordering ,good coffee from amazon com , good coffee
i am not a gourmet coffee critic but this stuff is disappointing based upon previous good reviews i suspect that the coffee in the k cups i received is not the same they may have changed the manufacturing the wolfgang puck decaf i received is watery and tasteless there is no aroma when it is brewing in the keurig never again ,tasteless and watery , not as good as i be
the wolfgang puck coffee chef columbian decaf is fantastic and very delicious i definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a great cup of coffee ,wonderful k cups , great coffee
nice round flavor not harsh or i enjoy it with french vanilla creamer lately it has been harder to find i do hope they have not discontinued it ,my favorite of the k cups , good coffee
coffee tastes great but the cups get torn apart when brewing what a mess that is i am quite disappointed because i do like this flavor of coffee ,bad cups , good coffee
perhaps my expectations were too high when i see the name wolfgang puck i expect to be impressed this to my taste is very average tasting coffee to be fair it is billed as a medium roast and that is what it is however it is just too bland for my taste br br if you want decaf with more character try green mountain coffee dark magic decaf a href http www amazon com gp product b n i green mountain coffee decaf dark magic k cup portion pack for keurig brewers count a or emeril jazzed up decaf a href http www amazon com gp product b b y emeril jazzed up decaf k cups a they are darker roasts though so if you want a milder coffee the wolfgang puck might be what you are looking for ,disappointing , not as good as i be
this is my wife favorite she grew up in seattle and has consumed countless gallons of various types of coffee in her lifetime so i assume this is good coffee she is also my wine taster as her palate is much more sensitive than mine ,wolfgang puck k cup decaf , great coffee
i tried this product solely for the fact it has wolfgang name on it i should have stuck with timothy brand this was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee more like a dinner coffee i will not be buying this again also way too expensive compared to the others ,bitter taste , not as good as it is
love this coffee but cannot buy it through regular so am by corner really sticks in my paying more than a buck a cup ,wonderful coffee , great coffee
we were given a keurig for a wedding present along with several variety packs so far wolfgang puck jamaica me crazy is our favorite and we will definitely be repeat buyers of this flavor ,our favorite k cup yet , great coffee
this is my favorite late evening cup of coffee nice flavor just right before for the night keep stocking this brand and i will keep coming back for it ,my favorite , great coffee
it is a great flavor and makes a great cup of coffee i fine you can have more than cup of this coffee and not feel like it is too much of a flavored coffee puck has a great flavor with this coffee ,great flavor coffee , great coffee
it sure would be nice if they stated anywhere in the description of this coffee that it is flavored i love the bed and breakfast coffee it is just plain coffee so i was surprised when i received the jamaica coffee and it was flavored yuck ,beware flavored coffee , not good
i ordered boxes of each and opened one box to find they were pods and not br for keurig and i cannot return them yes the pods fit into the keurig but br the end product is weak and awful i am most disappointed ,so disappointing , great taste
i love the puck flavors this vienna blend is very nice it is medium roast so it is not too strong has a wonderful flavor without being a flavored coffee one of my favorites ,yummy coffee , great coffee
we purchased an assorted package of k cups by various makers and of all the coffees this is my fave i really cannot see any reason to ever taste test another flavor it smells delicious and tastes delicious too ,the best coffee ever , great coffee
well the creme caramel was on sale so i decided to give it a shot plus the fact that each k cup is individually prepared by mr puck himself anyway i quite enjoy these i never buy flavored ones so overall i am happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as i usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild ,decent flavor , good but not great
honestly the first time i tried jamaica me crazy i had to double check to make sure that i did not leave the pod my last cup n the coffee maker weak coffee flavor did not appeal to me either might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side wolfgang vienna roast was pleasant though ,tastes like i did not change the kcup from the last cup , not as good as it is
love the flavor but of the cups in the count box were misshapen melted as if they would been exposed to heat during filling my husband used two of the ones that were not affected so i am not returning them but certainly wish quality control had caught this the affected k cups are so misshapen they will not fit into the space in the keurig ,k cups and , great taste
never got a delivery as fast as we did this time we were running low on our special coffee we have sampled many k cup coffees some in assorted packs and decided this is the best it is mellow never bitter and always totally enjoyable ,puck breakfast in bed coffee , great coffee
this is my second favorite after the breakfast in bed flavor i love wolfgang puck coffee it is a little bolder then the breakfast in bed but still smooth ,second favorite , best coffee ever
this is our favorite k cup at home mellow and flavorful br br also i wanted to clear up the question of whether or not this is decaf it is not see the response i received from wp coffee br br is breakfast in bed k cup actually a decaf coffee br br thanks for reaching out to wolfgang puck coffee the breakfast in bed is not a decaf blend br br thanks br m br customer service br wolfgang puck coffee ,breakfast in bed great smooth medium roast coffee this is not decaf , great coffee
the hawaiian hazelnut is my favorite k cup flavor from any vendor but it is always out of stock on amazon com it seems that all of the other puck flavors are available for a very reasonable cup price and sold directly by amazon com but price fluctuates wildly from rd party and has not been available directly from amazon com for months as i am writing this the price of a pack is from the cheapest rd party retailer which is absolutely ridiculous amazon why cannot you stock the hawaiian hazelnut the same way you stock the other flavors the fact that i would take the time to write a review about this should tell you how much i like the product ,hawaiian hazelnut always out of , great product
a discount from the amazon warehouse otherwise k cups are a little expensive when amazon does this it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly br br as i expected the expiration date is for a month or two from now so they were trying to get rid of them i also noticed the seals did not seem as tight as they normally are this also could be because it was sitting in amazon warehouse in the heat all summer br br as i expected about half of these k cups burst open while brewing this is not usual and i have tried many different brands this made them leak so clean up was kind of annoying and not taste as fresh but it still tasted decent bottom line when k cups are discounted from amazon warehouse be ready to pay in other ways lol ,good taste but are loose so they are open , not bad but not great
this is just the perfect thing to end a tired day the taste is smooth and warm and creamy i find that i look forward to having a cup while i read for a few minutes what a treat ,yummy , great taste
this coffee is good and has nice subtle flavor i am disappointed though because i looked at the bottom and it says decaf i bout you but i drink coffee for the caffeine in the picture on bottom of box has text but it is so small i did not even consider looking on it so just disappointed that is decaf and does not say on page when ordering ,this coffee is decaf just so know does not say on , not as good as i have
this is good vanilla coffee i got this and the green mountain and prefer this one it has a nice sweet flavor ,good vanilla coffee , good coffee
wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut coffee for keurig brewer good medium strength coffee with hazelnut flavor full body enjoyable anytime of the day i really like this coffee ,wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut k cup coffee , wolfgang puck k cup coffee
i really enjoy wolfgang puck k cups so far all the ones i have tried have not left my stomach and br br this was my first time trying out the sorrento fair trade roast and purchased it on a warehouse amazon price deal i am really happy with my purchase the taste of the sorrento is what i would expect of a medium roast a good smooth blend no bitter acidic after taste and leaves you wanting for more after that first cup at least it left me p it is does not leave you with the either it has that right balance you need with your daily cup of coffee br br yes i will be getting another count of this when i am finished with this pack br br stars ,the is smooth good blend no after taste , good coffee but not a great price
coffee quality is as good as expected but close to next time i will spend the extra few dollars and buy the coffee ,close to date , good coffee
i am a relative to keurig coffee but i do know that i was generally disappointed in the drink produced however the breakfast in bed k cup produces a nicely balanced not too thin cup without being too harsh i still have not achieved anything like what i can make either with my french press or with my drip machine but it is definitely better than the at work alternative community coffee ,best so far , not as good as it is
if you like a balanced cup of joe this is a great choice the coffee is smooth and balanced there is no bitterness or bite thank you chef puck for this fantastic decaf coffee choice ,makes a great cup of coffee , great coffee
smooth with a hint of flavor medium boldness yet rich in taste not a wake me up but certainly enjoyable ,breakfast in bed , good coffee
my second purchase of this like the first cup it has been wonderful to wake up to not too bold or but a good drink to start the day with ,excellent taste , great taste
the best thing that i look to every morning it makes my day the best tasting coffee ever ,best coffee ever , best coffee ever
i really enjoy this one and i have tried many in my top a little pricey but will order again sometime in the future ,good coffee for strong coffee lovers , good coffee
i too purchased this product thinking it might not be a flavored product and before it arrived i looked it up to see that there was some as to a coconut flavor br br so lets get this out of the way do not purchase this is you do not like flavored coffee it is flavored br br the first thing you notice is a deep coconut aroma almost akin to hazelnut in its presentation the initial mouthfeel is good a light roast but a to the roast which settles in nicely with the flavor which br has a definite dark chocolate taste without the bitterness br br the finish is chocolate jamaican coffee and faint toasted coconut br br bottom line if you like flavored coffee with coconut hazelnut cocoa you will like this coffee ,good if you like flavored coffee , good coffee
jamaica me crazy is an awesome smooth coffee light coconut vanilla flavorful taste br a good coffee if you do not like real strong coffee highly recommend ,puck favorite , great coffee
i got one k cup of wolfgang puck colombian reserve dark roast as part of a variety pack that i bought here on amazon since i would always assumed that i preferred the less burnt flavor of a light or medium roast i was pleasantly surprised that i enjoyed the way this coffee sat on my tongue it is sweet full and gently bitter i brewed it in a oz cup in an effort to dilute it a little but i may be enough to try a oz cup the next time around ,great i prefer a light medium roast , good coffee but not a great price
smooth delicious cannot wait to with my coffee i love all the wolfgang puck coffee flavors never a dull flavor ,mmmmm , great coffee
this is our first time trying the wolfgang puck coffee so glad we did it is a wonderful medium blend and great for any time of day i would buy it again ,wonderful coffee , great coffee
this is the best k cup coffee that we have been able to find very rich flavors and a medium roast we love this one ,best high quality k cup , best coffee ever
i am not a huge flavored coffee fan usually i prefer lattes with flavored syrups a friend sent me a k cup to try and the smell was mouth watering before it even finished brewing the flavor was strong enough to drink it only with milk i added a little vanilla syrup when i it i am not a coconut fan but the flavor is barely there it is just a unique taste for when you are in the mood for something different ,smells amazing , not as good as it is
i loved this brand it was the best vanilla flavor of others i tried i would buy more if it was a better price ,wolfgang puck coffee vanilla , great coffee
fantastic taste smooth feel no nasty aftertaste great with creamer what more can one want from a coffee this has become my favorite ,breakfast in bed is a treat , great coffee
best flavored k cup i have ever had i recommend this for everyone great flavor i have given it to all my friends and they get hooked ,love it , great coffee
i did not know what this would taste like but i am so glad i ordered it what a perfect cup of yummy coffee for a cool summer morning ,amazing , not as good as it
wake up to a cup of wolfgang puck coffe breakfast in bed medium roast k cup for keurig is a great way to start your day or just sit down and relax try it and you will be buying more br br shop amazon for wolfgang puck coffee breakfast in bed ,wolfgang puck breakfast in bed coffee , great coffee
this is a favorite in the office and in my house we burn through this coffee i have tried a few of the other wolfgang coffees and this one is by far the best i have seen better prices for this at a lot of other places this is an excellent coffee to start your day with ,bold great taste , great coffee
i have tried a wide selection of k cups including the big names like starbucks tully donut house dunkin donuts etc and they all have something in common either too watery weak or too bitter strong i tried breakfast in bed based on the reviews and i was not disappointed it is flavorful without being strong or weak it is hard to get a cup of coffee from a keurig that tastes like it was brewed like a normal coffee machine this k cup is the exception i will be stocking up ,great blend to get the day , good coffee but not a great price
love the wolfgang puck restaurants cookware brand products all his brand products cuisine are amazing i am a loyal fan yet this creme caramel coffee is tasteless no real coffee flavor no hint of caramel or creme it brews like a bit of steamed milk that somewhat pasty tasteless feel on your palate soooo dissapointed as i am such a loyal fan of all his brand products sadly a waste of did not return because i think food items are none refundable ,a wolfgang puck customer , great coffee
did not realize it was flavored and thought when i had my first sip that it tasted like chemicals f gave it away the next day at work ,it , not as good as it is
good but the green mountain reserve sumatra is better by and a half stars sort of tastes a little stale ,good but not perfect , good but not great
wonderful flavor would purchase this blend of coffee again light flavor not bitter at all and price was great the best i found anywhere ,wolfgang puck k cup breakfast in bed , great coffee
i find many of the k cups are a bit bitter for my taste i want something simple and smooth this coffee is wonderful ,smooth coffee taste , great coffee
wolfgang puck colombian coffee is delicious i find it to be a smooth and flavorful dark roast with a lovely aroma yet without a bitter or acidic quality that might leave an unpleasant aftertaste it is a bit expensive like all k cups but i think it is worth it due to convenience and exceptional flavor i definitely recommend this coffee to others ,delicious coffee , great coffee
not much of a coffee drinker but this wolfgang vienna brand is good not strong but a mellow taste the flavored coffees are getting on my nerves and this is just a good everyday coffee flavor everyone in the family and visitors like it would buy again ,this is very good , not as good as it is
i truly enjoy a good cup of coffee it does give me a lift in the morning wolfgang puck really knows how to produce a fine cup thanks ,a great cup of coffee , good coffee
great service and delivery for a really good product i am constantly looking for a good hazelnut coffee and so far this is the best along with green mountain ,thanks , great coffee
my family is full of coffee if you like robust coffee and use k cups this is the product for you ,best coffee , great coffee
while i love flavored coffees i had never tried any of the wolfgang puck line this moved to the top of my favorites list with the first cup not only is the aroma delightful the flavor is excellent as well i drink my coffee black and this one has no bitter after taste and the flavor is not overpowering the flavor is a very light coconut and the coffee is a medium body i must admit that i was a little hesitant about a coconut flavor do not be everyone around me wants a cup i refuse to share ,yum , great coffee

that freshly brewed aroma that the coffee people x bold does however the taste was another story it hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice sharp bite that gets your attention right away the finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice or cinnamon and just a slight lingering pleasant bitterness i really like this coffee but i think that i will stick with coffee people extra bold and this will be my back up brand however i will keep looking for something new who knows what i will find br br a href http www amazon com gp product b eo newman own organics special blend extra bold k cups for keurig brewers count boxes pack of a br a href http www amazon com gp product b l coffee people organic extra bold k cups for keurig brewers pack of amazon frustration free packaging a ,another great dark k cup coffee , great coffee

the box in small print i checked my current box and saw no such labeling information however the new boxes i received are a different color with a on label for hawaiian hazelnut and now the bottom of the box says it is made from decaff coffee while i like the flavor i do not want decaff in the morning which is when i drink coffee br br unfortunately i am unable to return this item to amazon because of their return policy which is why i am writing this review to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now i would give more stars for flavor but the lack of notification in the product description that this coffee is decaff makes me feel as if i tossed my money out the window buying something i would not have otherwise ordered ,this coffee is now , this is a good coffee
fans of donut house and coffee shop looking for that balanced smooth brew we found ourselves coming up just a bit short in the strength flavor area were made in brew size and eventually adding in a bit of emeril bold or various dark roasts well problem solved with the b in b smooth and flavorful and a good eye opener was worried the name somehow less caffeine based on our experience in these areas stars the except on three seperate occasions out of two boxes purchased we had k cups a small pop during brewing that sent coffee grounds over and in the keurig counter top and coffee cup this at our home brewer and our vacation house messy very messy requiring and careful cleaning inside cup holder and area minus star umm exactly who makes these things and where hopefully a road bump on the way to peace ,great cuppa except , not bad but not great
i have this flavor shipped automatically now along with several others this happens to be our favorite and i have to remind my husband the two boxes need to last until the next shipment a slight coconut aroma and flavor is so amazingly delightful in the morning not overly strong and perfect for our taste buds our favorite part of waking up in the morning ,our favorite , great coffee
are looking for a k cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting this coffee is not for you in my opinion you get a sumatran because you love strong coffee watered down it loses its get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor i make mine with k cups at the smallest setting by i would give a starbucks sumatra a rating for boldness the puck is about an the diedrich is a br i highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers provided you use the smallest cup setting you will not be disappointed best k cup i have had yet and i have tried many newman timothy donut shop diedrich etc br br addendum i have since tried th green mountain sumatran and gave that a one star stale and bitter i will definitely stay with puck ,outstanding bold best of the k cups , not my favorite
i bought a wolfgang puck sampler and this was certainly one of my favorites so i ordered a bigger box and have truly been enjoying it this is a classic medium roast cup of coffee it is very smooth with no bitterness i would say that if you enjoy donut shop tully kona and caribou you will like this blend the label is adorable and makes me smile when i pop it in the keurig each morning ,a very nice smooth coffee , good coffee
my favorite flavored coffee this is not available in any of my local stores better price than i have found at any local stores as well ,my favorite k cup , great coffee
been trying every coffee brand and flavor for over a year now and this is it i just love this coffee you should try a small box and see if you agree everyone has a different taste for coffee so you may not like it but worth a try i always say if you do not buy a ticket you will never win ,best coffee ever , great coffee
if you liked flavored coffees this one has a hint of coconut to it this is my favorite coffee by far i look forward to my first cup every morning ,coffee makes me a crazy , delicious
i love this coffee great taste and great way to start your morning if you like flavored coffee you will like this ,awesome coffee , great coffee
these k cups are great the coffee is mild and yummy but still very flavorful i love this cant wait to get my next shipment ,my favorite k cup so far , great coffee
this flavor is horrible there are many other flavors much better hawaiian hazelnut is great breakfast in bed is awesome ,not good at all , great taste
i caught this as a warehouse deal for k cups this was my first experience with any wolfgang puck coffee br the rodeo drive blend is good average coffee nothing exceptional i prefer a little stronger bolder coffee but at this price it works for me there is other brands that i like a little better but with k cups cost per unit is always something i have to factor in br i d buy it again cup but i probably would not full price if you keep your eyes peeled you can always find a good deal just have to be patient and stock up when the deals arise ,good coffee great price , great coffee
this is great coffee i am a coffee purist i do not add cream or sugar unless it is weak or bitter i truly enjoy coffee i have tried many different types of coffee for k cups this is my new favorite the price was amazing too very smooth and subtle hazelnut flavor not overpowering ,i am a coffee , great coffee
well we were looking for another coffee that would meet or exceed the k cups we were using and this has far out tasted the coffee cups we were using i have bought almost packages of these and used just about all of them and will be ordering a few more boxes here soon great coffee from a regular guy point of view ,great coffee , great coffee
take it from someone who was tried a lot of different k cups buy these the breakfast in bed blend is full of great flavor roasted perfectly and more importantly i have been choosing it over green mountain which says a lot it is true to its name perfect for the morning ,great coffee , great coffee
reading the previous comments people have stated they did not know this was a flavored coffee but it clearly states that it is atleast it did on the sight i bought mine from i was only brought to amazon for the secure feature it is a delightful flavored coffee depending on how you brew it and is a pleasant wake up any morning ,outstanding , not as good as it is
i did not know this had a coconut flavor or aroma as i got it in a variety pack i put it in this am and immediately smelled coconut and thought oh no i do not like sweet in the am but its not sweet i am quite surprised at the flavor and how i like it would i like it every morning no but it was a nice change made me feel i was waking up in a cottage on the ocean hearing music well maybe not but it was close ,coconut in the morning , not as good as it is
love my keurig coffee maker and i enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours a href http www amazon com gp product b wolfgang puck coffee creme caramel count k cups for keurig brewers pack of a seemed to be a safe choice i love coffee with cream i love caramel i even like wolfgang puck but his creme caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment it is not awful it just lacks a certain depth of flavour even using the small cup setting the aroma is very nice but the taste is a bit watery black the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste but it did not add any of the caramel creaminess i was expecting in short the coffee taste is very mild and the caramel taste is not all that great sorry wolfgang but i am afraid this one is a ,sorry wolfgang , not my favorite
i like dark strong coffee but i just did not really care for this one not sure what it really was almost a tad bitter unfortunately i have another whole box of to use up i picked up some sumatran reserve also a dark and prefer it ,just okay , not as good as it is
i have tried many different k cups and this has remained my favorite for the longest time it is the perfect balance not too weak and not too bold and since i usually drink my coffee black the flavor alone is very important to me it has a great flavor and not too acidic ,perfect every day coffee , great coffee
if you like your flavored coffee to taste like coffee this may not be for you i could not taste the coffee at all in the travel size brew but the smaller brew sizes were a bit better ,too much caramel cream not enough coffee , not as good as it is
amazon had this as buy one get one free and since it was my favorite i could not resist great purchase ,great coffee great price , great product
this product is great tasting and you do not even need sugar or creamer but if you like sweet coffee i would say a little sugar and creamer would not hurt this is a perfect product to wake up to every morning ,great taste , delicious
this is a smooth not bitter coffee it is a little more pricey than some which are just as good but it has a good sweet flavor and i can recommend it ,pretty good coffee , good coffee
i bought a small pack of this locally and liked it so much i bought the pack great deal on amazon ,tastes great , great product
bought a sample pack today of the jamaica me crazy and love the flavor the flavor is not too powerful nor was it overwhelming i would recommend the wolf gang puck k cups ,crazy , not as good as it is
i personally do not like strong coffee if you like weaker coffee then this blend is a great choice for you other reviews on here say that its too weak which is probably true if your used to something strong br br i also use flavored creamer to further enhance the taste for the price it cannot hurt to give it a try ,great taste and priced , not as good as it is
this is the smoothest and best tasting keurig coffee i have tried it is not bitter not too weak not too strong just right ,yum yum , great coffee
these are awesome as are all of wolfgang puck k cups the coffee is smooth the cups brew perfectly the taste is unbelievable my husband and i are hooked on these the price is great considering what amazing coffee this is ,can wolfgang make a bad k cup , great coffee
wolfgang puck french roast has a deep robust flavor i prefer it in the afternoon sometimes with a shot of oh yeah ,puck french roast , great coffee
i have tried every single french roast k cup and this is one of my favorites the starbucks and the barista are the two best french roast k cups but the between wolfgang puck and those two are negligible this one has that great sweet smoky flavor that every good french roast should have ,nice french roast , great coffee
this one is my wife favorite of all the hazlenut blends she has tried this is her go to after a busy day of being retired br delivery was exceptional as usual could not ask for much more ,wolfgang , great
a bold sampler pack while i found it flavorful i would not call it bold my first wp k cup was french roast which i found extremely bitter this coffee does not have that problem br br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano br br my favorite k cups are br starbucks french roast br starbucks caffe verona br starbucks pike place roast br green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve br green mountain double black diamond br green mountain revv br green mountain dark magic br br other k cups i have tried coffee people jet fuel green mountain dark magic decaf emeril jazzed up decaf starbucks caffe verona coffee people black tiger starbucks house blend starbucks breakfast blend starbucks sumatra wolfgang puck french roast green mountain lake and lodge green mountain french roast caribou mahogony wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya emeril big easy bold ,i would not it bold , i not not my favorite
my husband used to like the nantucket blend saying that it was awesome then he tried this one and it is the only one he drinks i drink other flavors but i like taking sips of this one for sure my husband is very over these cups and says it is the only one he drinks if you are a coffee drinker definitely try this one ,wonderful tasting coffee , good coffee
i drink my coffee black so quality is a must this is an excellent medium roast with a smooth consistency and perfect amount of kick i love all the puck coffee k cups but this is absolutely my favorite ,love this , great coffee
one of my top favorites it is infused with coconut and has a very unique flavor this coffee is best enjoyed without cream or sugar and it will become one of your favorites or you will never buy it again some of my other favorites are vanilla biscotti butter toffee hawaiian hazelnut and donut shop ,one of my top favorites , great coffee
i drink a lot of coffee and i buy several different types i found this particular one to be pleasant tasting with a nice aroma while brewing there is no after taste so you always want another cup ,good tasting coffee , not as good as it is
wonderful tasty coffee with a nice aroma as it is brewing there is no after taste at all and it very satisfying you always want another cup of coffee i continue to buy it ,great coffee , great coffee
a very nice flavor with no after taste it gives off a nice fragrance while brewing and has a very satisfying taste you have to have another cup ,nice flavorful and full , good
dark and full flavored but distinctly columbian this is a great morning coffee better cup of am joe than you will get at a coffee place ,good columbian , good coffee
there is so many different k cup to chose from so i asked in the store what brand and flavor is bought the most they suggested wolfgang puck coffee breakfast in bed the only had a few on the shelf and i was not disappointed now i am hooked for you people that use creamer this coffee is so good you will not even need creamer ,breakfast in bed review , great coffee
my favorite of the wolfgang series discovered when trying all of the flavors in the available sample pack very good flavor consistent with each pod and not overdone with added flavors very good dark roast colombian cup of coffee from the wolf ,wolfgang how to brew it , great coffee
we have tried all of the hazelnut flavored coffee brands this is by far the best to bad it is not an auto ship ,the best hazelnut out there , best coffee ever
there is not much i can say that has not already been said but when i brewed this coffee i really was not expecting to like it at all seeing as i do not normally like coconut flavored things but i really like the blend of flavors to me it does not really taste like coconut as much as it does just tropical ness in general it is like palm tree flavored coffee and the flavor is not too overpowering at all it still has a nice coffee taste it is just right ,great blend of flavor , not as good as it is
this is a dark smooth brew darker than timothy french vanilla but as with timothy it has only a slight hint of vanilla this is my third taste test searching for the best vanilla flavored coffee gloria jean was undrinkable timothy was pleasant but not as deep a roast as this if it only had more vanilla flavor this would be my hands down favorite ,only a hint of vanilla , good coffee
i have tried lots of flavors of coffee and this one is my favorite great taste not bitter at all a great flavored coffee for people who do not really like the taste of coffee ,great flavor , great coffee
the aroma is awesome love the flavor really gets you going in the morning prompt delivery this is definatly my husbands favorite single cup coffee ,great coffee , great coffee
after years with the keurig this is the best if you like a medium blend it perfect its smooth and has taste not watered down on either setting ,the best , great coffee
the caribou regular and morning blends which are ok but i can hardly drink them unless there is a creamer of some sort in them br br so on a recent trip to bb b i their wall of k cups and this one caught my eye i am generally a fan of flavored coffees and this sounded good so i bought an cup pack i have to say it is delicious the coconut flavor is light but definitely there and does not leave a bitter aftertaste like most black coffees do it smells so good my co workers have done a walking by my desk to ask me what smells so good br br obviously if you are a coffee connoisseur this will not be for you but if not it is definitely worth a shot and the best part for me aside from the flavor no stomach upset ,yum , good but not great
wolfgang puck makes the best coffee the package arrived on time and in perfect condition i would definitely order this again ,i would order again , coffee
have enjoyed every single cup of breakfast in bed just the right kind of brew to wake up these old bones and get me started on the day also enjoy it while watching so i can join enjoying a brew as well ,makes you feel like you are breakfast in bed , great taste
i love this brand the best hazelnut flavor ever i wait for it to go on sale because it is more expensive than the other brands also as another reviewer noted it does say decaff on the bottom of the package it really should state that in the product description i have noticed the packages from bed bath and beyond did not state this but cannot imagine both are available i will still purchase it because the flavor is so smooth ,my favorite hazelnut k cup , great product
for the best br br thankfully hawaiian hazelnut blows all of the other hazelnut k cups out of the water it is smokey and delicious without being dark and overwhelming the hazelnut really does taste like actual hazelnut which you would think would be something a coffee drinker could take for granted but we have been disappointed in the past i would never tried coffee from the wolfgang puck brand before but our positive experience with hawaiian hazelnut has definitely gotten me interested in trying other varieties br br the hazelnut flavor is pretty bold and full bodied which is nice but there is no bitterness or acidity to be found this suits me just fine since i enjoy a milder roast but people who enjoy their coffee strong and dark might not enjoy this blend as much br br we ll definitely be this coffee when we run out ,an excellent hazelnut choice for your keurig , great coffee
if you like to taste the flavor in your flavored coffee skip this one i have struggled to taste the creme caramel flavoring that is supposed to be in here the coffee flavor is also slightly bitter but that could just be my taste buds longing for some flavoring i would recommend green mountain gloria jeans or van houtte brands before this one ,where is the caramel creme , not as good as i be
i love this coffee it is one of my all time favorites it has the best flavor and i like the light roast br br excellent ,best darn coffee , great coffee
i love my keurig but have not found my perfect cup of coffee yet although this comes close i prefer a medium brew not bold or strong breakfast in bed is my choice so far ,good morning coffee , great coffee
i love sumatra coffee and was excited to receive these k cups however was disappointed when i opened my amazon box and found that the plastic wrap holding the two boxes of k cups was full of grinds meaning that there was a possible of a cup after carefully unwrapping the boxes and attempting to get as little coffee grinds everywhere as possible i opened the first box and all cups were fine however the second box every kcup was covered in fine grinds and i had to clean each one and found that of the cups were defective due to the top being on at an angle and the grinds had spilled everywhere i now see other reviews stating they had defective cups as well however the taste of the coffee is good ,tasty but defective cups , great coffee
jamaica me crazy is a sweet coconut flavored coffee that has a mild aftertaste it is not a bold blend but rather a mild to medium blend that more mild br br this is certainly not a first cup of morning coffee for die hard coffee drinkers who lean towards the medium to bold blends i would consider it a second cup of morning coffee afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee br br flavor is ok i would like it better if the aftertaste did not linger for a flavored coffee it is not bad if you are a coconut fan it is a blend to try on for size ,sweet coconut flavor with a mild aftertaste mild to medium blend , not good
truly not much needs to be said because it is wolf and to wake up to his coffee here at the house is fantastic ,it is , not as good as
i expected more flavor from w puck though this coffee does taste good it did not have caramel flavor as expected this is my opinion someone else may feel differently the price is okay i would not discount this product at all it is a good product try it you may like it ,good not great , not as good as it is
i have tried all vanilla coffee k cups and by far this is the best wolf gang puck vanilla francaise is a smooth vanilla experience that lasts way after the coffee is consumed try it you will love it ,best vanilla k cup coffee ever , great coffee
i am not a huge coconut fan so i was not excited about trying this but with one sip it definitely won me over the flavor is perfect and is now one of the flavors in our regular rotation and it smells so good ,delicious , not as good as it is
this is my daughter favorite k cup product mild medium roast it is the next best thing to having wolfgang cooking breakfast for you in your kitchen ,wolfgang puck breakfast in bed , great coffee
wow that is what my husband said when he tasted wolfgang puck jamaica me crazy coffee for my keurig he is not a fan of strong coffees and he really liked this one we both do i highly recommend this one can you put it on the subscribe and save a href http www amazon com gp product b v wolfgang puck coffee jamaica me crazy count k cups for keurig brewers pack of a ,this is the best , great coffee
i am sure this flavor is not for everyone but if you enjoy your coffee on the sweeter and more flavorful side then you should enjoy this it is not what i would call a strong coffee by any means i would describe it as mild and flavorful ,my favorite k , not as good as
i just recently got a keurig coffee maker registered it online keurig sent me a coupon for buy boxes get free awhile back a local bagel shop had a coconut coffee that i fell in love with so i decided to try this coffee out because it has coconut in it i brewed my first cup this morning it smelled very strong of coconut so of course i could not wait to try it after it cooled down a bit i took my first sip amazing it is quite delightful i strongly recommend it if you like coconut coffee no bitter aftertaste either no soot the bottom of my cup awesome ,delicious , good coffee
i was really impressed with this coffee it has a nice bold taste yet a smooth br finish i would order this coffee again ,good coffee , good coffee
when i t find island coconut k cups anywhere i found this and decided to try it although it is not exact it is so close it puts a smile on face the coconut is not over powering but you can taste the hint of it certainly i love this and would order again and again because this is available and island coconut is not ,so close to coconut k cups , not as good as it is
this is my absolute favorite coffee flavor out there i am so glad it comes in k cups and i am glad it is so inexpensive ,favorite , best coffee ever
i find this particular brand as good as the local coffee shop coffee d d which is a compliment to the maker i have made this particular brand my choice ,puck coffee breakfast in bed k cups , great coffee
i have at least dozen different k cups at my house right now because we love to experiment with different flavors my favorite is timothy rainforest espresso because i like a bold coffee but others that prefer something milder say that breakfast in bed is their favorite i like it to but only when made as a stronger brew i have purchased maybe boxes of this since it came out ,one of the best mild k cups made , great coffee
i normally drink only donut shop but when i saw this on sale i thought i would give it a try i was quite impressed with it and really enjoy this one i have now added it to my list of favorite k cups to buy ,this coffee is very good , not as good as it is
vanilla flavor is barely noticeable acidic taste not at all what i expected breakfast in bed and hawaiian hazelnut are much better choices ,disappointed , not as good as it is
i really like the flavor of this one it has a low acidity but still full of flavor now i have to have it every morning and i am having trouble finding another one i like this much ,love it , great taste
i am actually suprised from reading some of the about this coffee i have tried k cup varieties and this is by far my favorite contrary to some reviews i do not find it to be weak at all and in fact is quite bold but with absolutely not hints of being bitter very smooth and leaves a great aftertaste i prefer really strong coffee and this is a good compromise for a medium roast as it is not as bold as i would normally prefer but certainly strong enough to satisfy my preferences br br i typically drink wolfgang jamaica me crazy but ever since trying rodeo drive i have not gone back ,superb coffee , not good
i recently bought a pack of this coffee at bed bath and beyond as its brewing it smells great if you like coconut the taste is not bad but for me it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have i gave it stars because it is not terrible but i would not buy this coffee again if you are sensitive to after taste i would not recommend i would grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee ,a bit disappointed , not as good as it is
i am usually not a fan of flavored coffe or coconut for that matter and when i bought the sampler pack of jamaica me crazy i honestly did not see that it was a flavored coffee the aroma that it gives off while brewing me to a tropical island somewhere the flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all a great new addition to my coffee line up ,surprisingly delicious , not as good as i like
this is the best tasting coffee available on k cups the flavor is amazing it is more expensive than other brands but for a reason definitely worth trying ,best coffee ever , best coffee ever
this is one of the best coffees i have ever had for my keurig it is a nice smooth coffee and the price is the best price i could find i will be buying more ,excellent good tasting coffee , great coffee
my husband and i are with this coffee we take kcups and hide them around the house because we wanna make sure it lasts a long time such a bold and delicious flavor ,awesome flavor , great coffee
i had tried this coffee before it is wonderful smooth and rich full flavored but not too bold i would recommend it to anyone ,great coffee , great coffee
i tried this coffee even though it was significantly more expensive than the green mountain organic free trade sumatra that i have been using for some time wolfgang puck has the name and the rep br br if this were the only sumatra dark roast on the market i would be really happy with it this is good coffee br br it is not outstanding coffee compared to folgers this product is awesome unfortunately for mr puck i am comparing it to green mountain sumatra br br the organic and free trade sumatra from green mountain is better to my taste and it is cheaper mornings are good ,good but not a premium coffee , good coffee but not a great price
the coffee is good however the k cup is not packaged well the coffee machine barely coffee more of a fast drip the whole idea is it is fast right ,good coffee bad packaging , good coffee
it was a bit of a risk to order this i mean what are you going to do with boxes of kcups that taste terrible but this was delish the flavor was really good and it was still awesome after it had cooled down it has a coconutty vanilla flavor very nice ,love it , good stuff
i like the jamaica me crazy better but when it is out of stock this is my second choice br br it got a nice flavor strength without being bitter ,good flavor , great coffee
personal thing is not it so i will just tell you as a gauge my all time favorite k cup is timothy midnight magic a california roast which is dark i am partial to dark roasts and probably would not have even bothered with this sorrento but a friend had it so i tried it and lo and behold i am very glad i did i find this blend even better than puck ray which is his dark roast there is a whole lot of good flavor here the word luscious comes to mind this one not available every where and comes at a slight cost premium i say it is worth it these will be a regular for me ps a suggestion which seems apparent as with any k cup when you try a new blend use the plain old cup setting to check it out the first time ,i really like this one , not as good as i have
this is my favorite kcup i would describe it as medium dark creamy and rich and very consistent a lot of k cups seem acidic to me so i am really glad i found this one ,love this creamy coffee , great coffee
very delicious coffee thankfully amazon sells this flavor now i have been waiting for it since i tasted this last year i like the fact that you sell it in a pack rather than a single ,tasty , great coffee
a nice variety and freshly made one at that br br the salon has a nice variety of k cups wolfgang puck timothy and green mountain that owns keurig br br everyone taste vary but here is my of the ones that i have tried so far wolfgang puck was my second favorite so far i like folgers the best br br folgers gourmet br selections colombian br price per cup cents package of for br earthy flavor fruity and nutty flavors come through br br wolfgang puck chefs reserve colombian dark roast br price per cup cents package of for br a dark roast with caramel and earthy notes slight burnt br and papery flavors br br timothy decaffeinated colombian medium br price per cup cents package of for br a bit on the weak side kind of papery and less astringent than the others br br ali review ,not my favorite but it came in second , not bad but not great
delicious coffee good medium blend its hard to find something that isnt too weak or too bold with k cups but this flavor was perfect will buy again ,delicious , great coffee
good flavor coconut flavor is subtle and not overpowering in comparison there is another coconut coffee by green mountain in which the coconut flavor is overdone in my opinion ,good coffee , good coffee
the coffee is just ok a little weak the price is a little high and it is not worth the extra money ,wolfgang puck dark roast , not as good as it is
i was surprised to find out how weak this coffee is it has a good flavor but even on half cup it is very weak ,very weak , good coffee
to me this has a good balanced flavor some flavored k cups seem too light on hazelnut or too light on coffee this one is just right ,my favorite hazelnut coffee , great coffee
this k cup actually smelled up the office and it tastes as good as it smells i found it to be very flavorful ,smells good tastes good , good coffee
i was surprised to find out the coffee from my sampler had coconut in it i bought a sampler of k cups to try different flavors and would sit aside the ones that i liked to order in the future br br after drinking jamaica me crazy not realizing the ingredients just knowing i liked it when ordering reading through the reviews realized it had coconut in it and that was what made the taste so yummy leaving me wanting more i was hesitant to buy but decided to go for it and am really glad i did everyone i have shared my coffee surprise with loves it too ,me crazy so good , not as good as i be
light and flavorful definitely describes this k cup i often find it hard to find flavored k cups that are not either so strong you lose the flavor or so light you would be better off drinking water however i have to admit i have found a new favorite in the hawaiian hazelnut ,my favorite k cup yet , great product
i loved this coffee i just got my order a few days ago and i normally drink just one cup of coffee in the morning now i cannot wait and have had an afternoon cup too i must say i look forward to getting up in the morning just because i know i am having this coffee says a lot for a sleeper try this one i like it on to highest setting on my keurig it has an awesome aroma while brewing and the taste is smooth never bitter and there is something that hints of a slight with the first sips then the end of the sip is just a perfect brew too never any aftertaste or bitterness i am so happy to have found this thanks wolfgang i have now all of your kitchen cookware and now the coffee too ,first but not last time to buy this one , good but not great
best k cup around a must try amazon ships quickly and in one piece i would recommend the coffee as well as going through amazon to order this coffee from thank you for a great experience ,yum o , great coffee
usually do not get the breakfast blends but it was on sale and decided at price would try it out it was not as weak as some breakfast blends tend to be not bad ,on , not as good as it is
wolfgang puck definitely has the best coffee for the money i absolutely love the french vanilla the kcup actually makes a good full cup of coffee it could be a tad stronger but overall it is really good i still prefer the senseo pods to the kcups though ,best coffee , good coffee
jamaica me crazy has a slight overtone of cinnamon that is a very nice compliment to the taste of coffee the flavoring is strong enough to taste not just smell without overpowering the flavor of the coffee very good ,jamaica me crazy is our favorite k cup so far , great coffee
i drink my coffee with a splash of half and half other hazelnut k cups are too bland for me i much prefer wolfgang puck excellent rich roast with definite but not overpowering hazelnut flavor ,perfect , great coffee
d timothy world coffee breakfast blend for keurig brewers count k cups pack of a but this one edges it out smooth and balanced it really is great from the first sip till the last drop br br there will never be a coffee that all coffee lovers will agree on but if you like a light medium roast give the breakfast in bed blend a try very low in acidity someone who cannot tolerate the acidity in coffee may be able to enjoy this blend but be aware and contrary to popular belief light roast coffee is typically higher in caffine than the dark roast coffees the extended roasting to produce a dark roast burns away some of the caffine this one will definately get you going in the morning in a good way br br those who prefer a dark roast or extra bold should probably look elsewhere ,excellent smooth light coffee good anytime , not my favorite
taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before i mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning small print on the bottom of the box i mean point tells this several mornings of headaches could have been avoided this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine i do not know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale ,good taste but decaf , not as good as it is
too bad no one else had reviewed this before my purchase it is not bold or dark enough to stand up to the keurig rd button and tasted a little tangy for my liking ,down to go , great taste
this coffee says medium roast but is actually a little stronger we loved it and it has become our favorite if you want some coffee to caffeine you up this is the one for you also wolfgang puck breakfast in bed is great not so strong ,puck rodeo drive k cup , great coffee
i cannot remember when i have had a cup of coffee so delicious i immediately wanted another cup there is no bitter taste no funny chemical taste you get with so many flavored coffees no odd aftertaste it is just a mellow gorgeous hazelnut with a touch of the islands cup of coffee outstanding my favorite i have ever tried and i have tried most ,delicious , not as good as it is
this is very good coffee but it does not have as much flavor as the van creme caramel if your looking for something that has a lot of flavor go with the other if you are looking for something that is more coffee than flavor this is it ,not as good , good coffee
by far this is the best flavored k cup coffee i have ever had good body not bitter no flowery aroma like with the green mountain flavored k cups i like my coffee a little stronger than puck hawaiian hazelnut but it is certainly a fine medium bodied coffee i could drink over and over ,i would buy it again , best coffee ever
these k cups are wonderful we were pleasantly surprised with the low acidity and smooth flavor the rodeo drive k cups are on our top five k cup list ,smooth delish , great coffee
k cups to make one extra large travel mug of coffee br that said we have found that mixing this flavor with other flavors to make an extra large serving is a most enjoyable at our house the most popular combo so far are jamaica me crazy with a href http www amazon com gp product b van houtte french vanilla k cups for keurig brewers count boxes pack of a hazlenut a href http www amazon com gp product b m van houtte hazelnut decaffeinated k cups for keurig brewers count boxes pack of a or costa rican a href http www amazon com gp product b hkzz i van houtte caf eacute costa rica light roast count k cups for keurig brewers pack of a in the end this is one of the most versatile flavors for those of us who have frequent visitors and several to please ,mmm great coffee aroma , great coffee
bought this during one of amazon friday sales did not find too many reviews since these are fairly new took a chance and am very pleased we like our coffee rich and strong and this one delivers great tasting dark roast coffee ,yum rich strong and not bitter , not as good as it is
this coffee is surprisingly delicious we never had a problem with the k cups bursting maybe it is a defect on the coffee brewer this coffee is a bit less strong than we normally prefer our coffee but it makes up with great taste look forward to my mug every morning would definitely recommend it and will buy it again ,yummy hazelnut , great coffee
i personally did not care for the coffee too mild for me and a little nutty flavor in it i will stick with tully kona and house blends also emeril big easy bold ,coffee , good coffee
exact same as the ones bought at the store only a lot cheaper recommended for any keurig drinkers out there ,great , great product
this is my favorite coffee blending of hazelnut and coconut are perfect thank you br br question why was i charged postage on this brand when i have never paid on any other brand of k cups from amazon ,wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut , great coffee
if you like your keurig you need to try this k cup smooth taste with just a slight hint of flavor not overwhelming like some brands my new favorite ,best flavor available , great taste
this is our favorite k cup coffee it is strong and taste great although it seems that many of the k cups have nearly the same overall taste ,favorite of the keurig coffee k cups , best coffee ever
more than a hint of coconut not very much vanilla being a vanilla fan and not a coconut fan this is ok ,coffee lover , great taste
this is a good tasting k cup from a guy who drinks coffee black and prefers a bold full flavored taste i would recommend ,works for me , good coffee
i love using k cups although i have tried so many bad coffees i have finally hit on one dark roast coffee that is not bitter and has a wonderful flavor you do not have to try them all this is a perfect blend coffee ,you do not have to look any , great coffee
ok so this is the best flavored coffee ever no after taste that seems to always occur w flavored coffees its not even really flavored it has hint of coconut taste but it really still tastes like coffee just the best coffee ever mmmmmm add honey yummy br highly recommend ,should be best flavored coffee ever , not as good as it is
wolfgang puck k cups are under the their coffees are smooth and delicious and jamaica me crazy is my fav and the best coconut flavored coffee on the market island coconut is quite poor in comparison ,my very k cup coffee , great coffee
i have always hated the or starbucks burnt bitter taste this is a great blend still strong without the burn roasting br br fyi low quality beans are burned to hide it is bad taste ,perfect blend , good coffee
i like the darker roast coffees and this fits the bill this is every bit as good as deidrich and but typically costs more i guess wants a cut if you catch it on sale buy it ,excellent brew , good coffee
this coffee is a lot like the green mountain nantucket blend if you like that you will like this generally the gm product costs less but this was on sale ,pretty good , not good
it was as good if not better than i was told great taste i will it again ,jamaica me crazy coffee , not as good as
probably because it does not taste like coffee it is flavorless i saw the good reviews and thought i would get a couple boxes and now i am stuck with a bunch of k cups that i do not want to drink because i would rather literally drink any other k cup i have ever tried as you can see i am not a fan of these k cups these are the worst ever ,i do not enjoy this coffee , not as good as i have
i will drink this if all other coffee options are the coffee has a vanilla coconut smell but after a sip or two i cannot drink it would not purchase again and i am having trouble even giving it away i expected more from wolfgang puck ,if there were no other coffee in the house , not as good as it is
i love caramel and was excited when this arrived but i am so disappointed hardly any flavor at all of coffee or caramel ,caramel , great taste
who prefer a strong dark cup of coffee even at the larger mug setting should try that brand br br previously i had found the dark roast green mountain coffees rather boring but revv lives up to the hype both in strength and flavor another great green mountain coffee is their espresso blend though amazon does not stock it so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick and mortar stores such as bed bath and beyond finally a favorite regular over the years has been a href http www amazon com gp product b m w yq emeril big easy bold a it is a very nice coffee though do not expect the new orleans experience of chicory flavor br br bottom line you will not go wrong with the wolfgang puck coffees but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees ,unremarkable , unremarkable

this is an excellent full bodied coffee without a bitter taste in general the wolfgang puck coffees are quite good although a little more expensive than some of the other k cups ,excellent coffee , great coffee
as always i love this coffee it is about the only kind i buy for myself the turn around time is terrific when i have about a week worth of cups left i order and have the next batch in perfect timing very happy with everything about this product ,jamaica me crazy k cups , great coffee
this coffee is a smooth yet robust taste that does not have any bad after br taste a href http www amazon com gp product b wolfgang puck coffee rodeo drive blend medium roast count k cups for keurig brewers pack of a ,wolfgang puck keurig cup coffee , a cup of coffee
i have tried many brands of medium roast coffees however this is my favorite some i have tried are bitter some are too light some are too strong but this one for me is just right some brands more than others come in all puffed up and when punctured the grounds filter out into the needle of the keurig coffee maker and has to be cleaned which is not difficult just annoying never had a problem with these breakfast in bed k cups are smooth not too light and not too strong right in the no bitter after taste either and perfect any time of day enjoy ,just right anytime of day , good coffee but not a great price
sometimes we have a problem ordering the k cups because they are way too strong for us even if you order medium blend this coffee was great just right it was a smooth blend and was perfect for a morning cup of coffee or anytime would definitely order again ,great smooth tasting coffee , good coffee
reviewers taste buds are weak this is some br weak coffee i am not some crazy gotta have my jet black sludge to get br through the day coffee drinker i would say my favorite and my wife is br caribou blend this blend is weak it cannot hold half and half or even br just whole milk without being wiped out now i will say i brew it on br the large cup oz i believe setting on our keurig so maybe it br a bit better on the oz setting or even the small setting but caribou we br also like donut shop green mountain kona blend etc can be easily br brewed on and hold a good bold taste this coffee doesn t br hold a candle to any of those now i am stuck with of these blech maybe br the guests will not mind it ,either i got a bad batch or , not bad but not great
good description of this product has the over roasted popular coffee flavor but not overpowering one of my favorites so far ,great flavor , good coffee
i ordered this by accident and i am so happy i did this is a new favorite of mine it is nice and strong without being bitter ,wolfgang puck sumatra , great taste
pretty good i can see that some people might make this their favorite because it is different br br will i buy this again no it is good but it is not my preference and i might as well buy the ones that make me rave on and on about how good they are usually tully french kona italian and house those may be too strong for some people and the rodeo drive blend does have its own unique taste which may really appeal to some coffee drinkers as with most things actually a little more than in most things with coffee it is a matter of taste and probably a matter of what you are in the habit of drinking you may want to try this one especially if you can find it in a sample packet or do like i do keep the rest for guests to try ,not bad smooth not bitter strong but not too strong , not bad but not bad
i really love this coffee great tasting and bold however on about rd of the pods the foil from the cup and blows grounds into the brewer and my coffee cup i can usually which ones will do it because the foil on the k cup is not puffy like it has pressure but flat and wrinkled ,great coffee k cups , great coffee
it is coconut flavored either you will like it or not i was actually surprised since i am not a big fan of coconut but i liked this coffee not my favorite but nice on occasion ,did not say anywhere it was coconut , the best
my friend says she loves this coffee and has never been able to find it in the local stores where we live she did not know that amazon sells just about anything you could want no tax and free shipping what could be better ,bought this for a friend , great product
hazelnut being the household favorite favorite i thought i would give these k cups a try the flavor is smooth and delightful i suggest trying this brand for your k cup machine ,yum , great coffee
this is good but could be a bit stronger in the hazelnut flavor it is good though and i would purchase it again ,wish i were in , good
i love the taste but have found that many of the cups explode the glue on the side of the cup becomes and then the cup very hard to clean up do not think i will buy this brand again ,poor quality , great taste
i love jamaica me crazy coffee this version is flavorful the price is pretty good and it sure beats the office pot coffee that sits on a for hours fresh coffee fast ,great coffee , great coffee
this is less of a bold flavor and more of an acidic and bitter coffee my wife is easy to please and she is not a fan i will finish the box but i reach of others first ,a little too much acid , good coffee
this coffee has become one of my daily favorites it is not quite as strong as many of the french roasts but it is also not as bitter a good way to start the day ,a good daily roast , good coffee
this is my favorite so far amongst the wolfgang puck k cups the word that comes to mind when i sip it is bright it has a natural sweetness and good flavor without being overly heavy the packaging lists it as a medium roast but i would put it more towards the light end of the spectrum it is a very enjoyable cup and i would recommend if you are looking for something to switch up with green popular vermont country blend or breakfast blend br br i generally have not been impressed with the wolfgang puck flavored varieties vanilla jamaica me crazy but this regular cup is quite good ,one of the best for puck k cups , great coffee
i have had all of the various since they came on the market for home use thus i have tried pretty near all of the various k cups this is one of my top favorites love the coconut in it and the wonderful coffee flavor yum ,one of my favorites , great coffee
this coffee was not what i expected but enjoyed it greatly i was looking for a stronger vanilla flavor but after trying it i enjoyed it a lot it was light and smooth and left no aftertaste i would recommend this to others ,very satisfied with my purchase as always with amazon , not as good as it is
i like columbian coffee and this is above average with a good dark color with a nice smell the taste is bolder than average but not unpleasant or bitter this is my strong columbian coffee combining all the good things of the type with a bolder taste ,a columbian , not good
smooth i normally drink dark roasts but purchased this on a lightning deal or maybe a friday sale i like it ,i liked it , good coffee
the coffee is just ok it is very mild almost on weak would buy it again if the price was right ,just ok coffee , good coffee
i have tried every bold k cup and this is one is one of my favorites very nice flavor and strength ,great coffee , great coffee
bought this on the recommendation of my son not a big fan of flavored coffee but a cup a day of this lightly flavored coconut coffee puts me in the islands how can you go wrong with wolfgang puck ,me flavorful , not as good as
this coffee says dark roast extra bold and it isn t it is weak and barely beats out a cup of folgers ,wolfgang puck sumatra , great coffee
we have a keurig coffee maker one of the side benefits is the opportunity to experiment with different k cups i have already tried half a score some seem pretty tasty at first until one taste something that is even better some early k cups that i highly do not compare too well with later brands that i have tried br br wolfgang puck columbian dark roast noir is one of the better products that i have tried it has a bold taste although not strongly so it is also smooth tasting br br it is now on my short list of possibilities for my first morning cup of coffee so i am pretty happy with wolfgang puck product here ,average k cup coffee , good coffee
this is my favorite coffee flavor and i have not had it in a long time forgot how delicious it was until we ordered the k cups love them already ordered more ,me crazy , great coffee
we have only been using the k cups about months both my wife and i like our coffee bold i have been by amazon reviews and started out with coffee people jet fuel although that is still my favorite i got this french roast on a friday sale and would say that it is my new second choice i have also tried coffee people black tiger a close third and kona not a fan this is a nice well rounded every day cup more on the bold side but not so ,nice rich flavor good cup of coffee , good coffee
the flavor of this coffee is good it has a nice balance of vanilla without being too strong it is not the coffee but it is a nice afternoon treat br br that being said i have had problems with several pods when you hold them up to the light you can see that there are grounds outside of the filter portion of the pod this causes a cup full of grounds when you brew the coffee and also clogs up the pin at the bottom of the pod i would say about out of every or pods has this problem ,good flavor but bad quality , not as good as i be
i love the taste of this coffee but in my last order of four boxes about every other k cup has a tear or rip in the internal filter and thus the grounds flow through into the cup of coffee which the value of the coffee as drinkable wolfgang needs to correct this flaw in packaging i will not order again because of the waste ,for not again , good coffee
i bought this coffee for my keurig coffee maker and i really like it smooth and the best thing it is an organic wolfgang uses the the best beans for his coffee buy you will be pleasantly surprised ,k cup wolfgang puck , great coffee
great tasting coffee strong but not strong and no nasty aftertaste too bad it cannot be purchased on subscribe and save anymore ,wolfgang puck coffee coffee house , great coffee
this is the best all around st cup in the morning coffee ever i love it perfect flavor ,up to , best coffee ever
by far the tastiest coffee i have purchased from amazon sorry it is not in the shop and save any longer delicious ,breakfast , great coffee
love this blend so was delighted to find it on your subscribe save program at a better price br than w keurig so really disappointed to learn today it was no longer available on said program br shame on ,fave k cup french roast , great coffee
i have tried about different k cup flavors and this is my favorite it has a wonderful aroma and just the right amount of hazelnut use the subscribe option and this is a deal that cannot be beat ,very nice taste , great coffee
i admit i like my french vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side this isn t it is a much stronger coffee brew meaning more sugar and creamer is needed to tone down the coffee flavor on the other hand it is a reasonable alternative if my preferred brand van houtte is not on sale or when it is occasionally out of stock i like that it comes in a pack because our family goes through a lot of k cups and i do not have to order quite so often ,not as sweet as other french vanilla coffees , not as good as i be
i buy these with subscribe and save i like the flavor and aroma going on month two and i am not tired of them yet ,great coffee great price , great product
i was very excited when i received a keurig coffee maker as a christmas present could not wait to put it to use however in the three months since i have had it i have struggled to find what i think is a good cup of coffee most of the brands i have tried have either been too weak or too strong br br i am not a starbucks kind of coffee drinker or fan of fancy flavored coffees i just like a regular cup of coffee that smells good when it is brewing tastes smooth when i drink it finally just like said this one is just right ,what i have been looking for , not as good as i have
one of the weaker flavored coffees but a yummy one almost no need for milk as it is already creamy tasting ,yum but weak , good flavor
this coffee is awesome kinda bold with a sweetness excellent my son says with international carmel creamer you can find in the dairy section ,for true coffee lovers , great coffee
the coffee was great spent some time in jamaica and got to love the coffee nice to get in back home as well ,great coffee , good coffee
i got this with the purchase of different bold coffee k cups to find the ones i like best and so far this is my favorite it may not be bold enough for some but it is not supposed to compete with the extra bold varieties this was smooth and not nearly as bitter as many bold coffees so many bold blends have a burned flavor leaving a bad taste in your mouth this one was strong without the bad aftertaste perfect for me ,very good coffee , good coffee but not a great price
i like full bodied coffee and to try something different to supplement the standard one i use this coffee was perfect for that purpose timothy rainforest expresso is still my standard one but i will order this again ,good k cup , good coffee
creme caramel is by far my favorite great coffee flavor not too weak with a wonderful caramel aroma ,rich and wonderful , great coffee
i drink alot of coffee and love hazelnut coffee this brand has the best flavor i have ever tasted i have bought several different brands and this one is the best it may be a few dollars more but it is worth it i absolutely love and enjoy it every morning ,great coffee , great coffee
years ago my daughter brought home creme brulee for the first time it was perfect beans to be ground since then i have searched for anything similar when i realized i could not find it she had what one she purchased br br this one has a strong flavor but it tastes fake with a strong after taste unfortunately it is one of the better ones if anyone reads this and knows what ones carmel and vanilla taste great please post here ,cannot find the perfect creme e coffee , not as good as it is
i really like the taste of this coffee my only complaint is that the coffee grinds end up in my coffee not a huge fan of that and even though i really like the taste of it i will not order again bummer ,yummy coffee not a fan of coffee though , not as good as it is
my favorite i have it auto shipped through amazon the only problem i have is i drink way too much coffee now because i like it so much ,my favorite coffee , great coffee
this is one of my favorite k cups it is a rich dark coffee without the bitterness of some highly recommended ,one of my favorite k cups , great coffee
i thought the coffee tasted fine it was not strong enough for my husband several of the pods burst during brewing i probably will not purchase this again ,ok , great coffee
this is my favorite of the flavored coffees i am not usually a fan of coconut but this coffee is deliciously coconutty chocolaty love it ,scrumptious , great coffee
yummy mild and delicious my new favorite mild in to coffees called fuel and taste like oil but truly a medium roast pleasant in the morning makes you glad to have a good cup of coffee ,my new favorite , great coffee
wolfgang puck coffees are great and the creme caramel is one of my favorites i would recommend this coffee for people who like a mild flavor ,great flavored coffee , great coffee
i thought that because of the name attached that i would be wow its just a good average coffee nothing spectacular ,decent coffee but i , not as good as it is
i bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite jet fuel or emeril big intense bold liked this one typically sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well br br i am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label br it is not bold it is extremely mild and smoky tasting not a single member of my family liked it and that is very unusual br br i m going to contact the company to see if they will exchange it or refund me it is that bad ,horrible did something , not as good as i be
as coffee in general this wolfgang variety was alright however i was expecting a creme caramel taste or something similar and i do not feel this delivered i tried multiple cups at different cup sizes and this coffee just did not do it for me it is marketed as a flavored coffee yet i could not taste anything beyond the flavor of coffee ,misleading flavor name , not as good as i have
i prefer mild to medium coffee and i have tried so many different k cups but i will stay with this one the other reviews were right on smooth and not any bitterness just a great cup of joe with amazon prime it came super fast if you are not a prime member i strongly recommend it ,yummy , great coffee
this is a good french roast coffee although it could be a little bolder i have never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup it is extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess ,cups can be defective , great coffee
i am having a blast with my new keurig machine trying out a bunch of new flavors including the dark roast it is nice and flavorful particularly since i run each of my cups through the small cup brewing cycle times to fill my large mug this works br tried the chocolate donut flavor the other day and loved it br love the convenience and bargain prices of the subscribe save ,love the dark rich flavor , great taste
i am impressed with mr puck different blends this one is a favorite of ours it lives up to the medium roast name full bodied not acidic and smells great while brewing will buy again ,very good cup of coffee , good coffee
great deal great what a difference from other orders i have placed with other vendors got the package the day after i ordered it ,great deal , great coffee
if you like vanilla flavored coffee this is it i put a french vanilla creamer in and no other sweetner is needed i have it every day and i will always order ahead so i do not run out ,best coffee ever , great coffee
this coffee is bold and none of the bitterness that is usually found in bold coffee it also in the single serve coffee ratings and i concur there is a lot of out there in k cups this and wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut are great ,high rating , great coffee
i got this is a low cost alternative to my normal jet fuel and it just did not measure up i like strong coffee but this had a bitter taste that i just did not care for also of the cups had some sort of and dumped their grinds into my cup not sure why ,not my favorite , not as good as it is
very smooth and flavorful for a medium roast i was pleasantly surprised by this k cup and would get it again the off deal me to it and i am glad ,very tasty , great coffee
this coffee is not a true medium roast like caribou french roast donut house etc there was not much coffee flavor at all i found it to be so weak in flavor that not only did i have to go down a brew size but i also have to add less milk just too drink it i will never buy it again wish i did not have more cups to go thru ,not much flavor to this coffee , not as good as i have
i ordered wolf gang puck k cups largely because of his reputation and my experiences at his restaurants both of which are good however when i drank my first cup of the breakfast blend i tasted no coffee it was as if i was drinking hot water i was very disappointed and will purchase only those k cups which i know to be good sorry wolf gang this is a sleeper ,kcup breakfast blend a , not as good as it is
this is my favorite of all the coffees i have tried smooth and flavorful without being a flavored coffee its a definite treat anytime of day ,great brew , great coffee
i was expecting a mellow caramel flavor but this coffee is a bit sharp and you really cannot make out any carmel flavor ,a bit of a disappointment , good coffee
in a k cup machine at an ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee since i brew a cup for my wife and i at the same time i run two ounce cups with one of these k cups into a small and then pour into two coffee cups which still yields a strong flavor but not enough pop your eyeballs out br br of course brewing two cups with one k cup drops the price down in half which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of k cup brewing i find most k cups are good for up to a ounce cup and ounces would them too much but this works for my wife and i since i have been a cup for each of us for years and brewing two cups with one k cup is economical ,strong dark roast coffee , i love it
i am only drinking it so it will not be wasted and i have to rotate it with a coffee people product so i remember why i like coffee it is really the strongest flavor profile is tin i love creme caramel and am a huge wp fan but the flavor and consistancy of this coffee does not impress choose another you will not be sorry you did ,so weak , not as good as i will
my favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like french italian and full city this k cup dark roast has a big bold flavor but lacks balance the level of smokiness bitterness and acid are way too high and the result is not enjoyable i liked the dark roasts for the keurig from green mt newman and donut shop much more than this one ,too bitter and , not good
this product takes getting used to only after using about k cups did i start liking it however i would not buy this many again ,taste , good
i am loving this coffee it is smooth and bold but not too bold it reminds me of starbucks coffee but not as bitter very very very good cup of coffee give it a try i am really glad i did ,my new favorite kcup , great coffee
i love wolfgang puck products but the coffee is very disappointing br there is a weak flavor almost tastes diluted br some must have changed out all the real puck products br ,weak coffee little flavor , great coffee
this is the st k cup coffee that i am getting grounds in my coffee it is about every cups i have not had this problem with other k cup manufactures i will not reorder ,defective , good coffee
until i tried vienna coffee house donut shop was the one i had on automatic monthly delivery vienna coffee house is a tad bolder than donut shop but very smooth without any bitterness from the first cup i knew i had to switch ,better than , delicious
of all the k cups i have purchased so far i like this french roast the best it has a really bold taste even used with the large cup button i like other coffee selections too but this one really stands out br br i consider myself an early adapter and the keurig coffee machine is one of my best purchases although the coffee is somewhat expensive at a cup there is no waste no pot cleanup and best of all great coffee i usually get up earlier than the rest of the household and can have my great coffee almost instantly without making a full pot that can go sour before all being drank br br i notice that regular such as target and grocery stores are now carrying k cups but buying online costs less and is more convenient ,favorite k cup , great coffee
i do not drink a lot of flavored k cups but people have been raving about wolfgang puck k cups so i gave this a try it is definitely a good quality flavored coffee with a medium body overall i have enjoyed several cups of this and have temporarily my timothy flavored k cups in favor of this one i sometimes add sugar free vanilla syrup cream and cinnamon it is excellent that was in place of dessert i also tried caramel syrup added to this do not do it it overwhelms the flavor ,good quality one of my go to flavored k cups , not as good as i have
i love coffee with no bitterness and lots of good coffee taste and this one fits the bill holds up well to milk sugar i love it in the morning for the first cup and in the evening just as much definitely would buy it again ,good medium coffee , great coffee
i love love love this coffee it is easy on my stomach yet it has a rich medium roasted flavor which in my opinion is not bland at all it is such a delicious cup of coffee i have told everyone about these i have even converted green mountain lovers over to wolfgang puck rodeo drive brand if you like your coffee fully flavorful and delicious but not too robust or bold this coffee is for you i have tried many k cup brands tully green mountain emeril donut shop etc and this brand is equal to green mountain possibly even a bit better ,my favorite so far , great coffee
having had wolfgang puck k cups i was hoping they would be as good as the wolfgang puck coffee i have had in hotel that were a part of my room but alas i was mistaken i would not say it is the worst i have had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too i feel like i am drinking coffee that is been made with grounds that have already been in other words the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and i am getting leftovers br br if you are looking for a flavored coffee that does not really taste like much of anything this is your pod if you are looking for better richer flavors stick with green mountain which sadly amazon does not seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge for a box ,just , not bad but not great
this is a fantastic decaf coffee my parents love decaf but there are not many out there they enjoy we have been drinking timothy decaf colombian and we bought this to try it fantastic i would definitely buy this again and again it is smooth and not bitter it is not super strong so do not expect it to be like a this is a really great colombian cup of coffee you will not miss the ,delicious amazing for a decaf coffee , good coffee
i like my coffe of the milder but tasteful side i thought this was a great cup of coffe i compare it to timothy shoppe full flavor but not acid this is for people who want a lighter cup of coffee ,great cup of coffee , great coffee
i tried a double boxes of this when the donut shop coffee i usually order was unavailable while the coffee is pretty good the cups suck a full of the cups brewed are undrinkable they are slow to brew coffee maker has to work very hard and even then the cup retains an amount of water checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed they could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee i believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable ,never again , great coffee
me crazy is the best coffee it is not too strong and has a unique taste no complaints here highly recommend it ,love it , best coffee ever
i like bold coffees and should have trusted the other reviewer who said it was not strong enough this one has a watery finish to it and not very much flavor i will be going back to emeril jazz d up decaf and trying the coffee people french roast decaf so far i have loved everything by the coffee people except the organic blend if you like strong coffee do not buy this but if you like a weaker coffee that you can see through you would probably enjoy this one ,it is okay but i will not buy it again , good coffee but not a great price
this not only tastes great but has the best aroma while brewing subscribe and save is the way to go ,one of the best flavored k cups , great coffee
i love this coffee i am not a strong coffee drinker and this coffee is perfect i have no problems with it working in my cuisinart keurig brewer i get the perfect tasting cup of coffee br br i gave it stars because one of the packs contained only k cups and not the that it was supposed to have br br the decaf count pack of arrived with the correct amount of k cups and is as yummy as the high test ,great taste , great coffee
trying out different pods and this is a delicious one service was excellent no hassle at all will buy from again ,coffee , great coffee
some of the other out in keurig land but it is not bitter there is just a little of something chocolatey in the flavor br br my only complaint is that this coffee like most of the keurig cups that do not say extra bold on them they brew up pretty weak if you do a larger mug i typically brew the oz size and on these guys i it down to the oz size if i brew it in the larger cups it just comes out too weak br br if you are one who feels that k cups usually make weak coffee you will think that these are really weak and be tempted to brew em two at a time this coffee is not plain or there is just less coffee in the k cup or rather the normal not extra bold amount so it brews up weaker ,interesting flavor brew small cup , not as good as i be
i like this coffee its nice to drink it in the morning it has medium body and full flavour goes great with raw sugar and splash of non fat milk ,nice , great coffee
this was the flavored coffee i have ever had in kcups i purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag it smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what i expected i will stick to gloria jeans and flavored coffees this was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last i order of his brand i thought maybe i got a bad cup but i brewed and i opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same ,yuck , not as good as it is
i am a sucker for caramel anything love the flavor the aroma and most important the taste i honestly do not like flavored coffees in the morning but i have made an exception for this one ,wonderful flavored coffee , great taste
i am trying many different coffees to see which one i like best this coffee was good but a little stronger than i had expected i know it say extra bold but others i have tried have not been that extra i ended up putting it on my larger cup setting and it was perfect then there was a little after taste but not much more than other coffees i would recommend it if you like stronger coffees but it is not as strong as an espresso i intend to purchase this again ,good n strong , not as good as i have
i thought it had a bitter orange flavor however my husband and friend liked it ,tasted like bitter , not as good as
we have tried just about every k cup of regular coffee out there we do not do the flavor kind my husband loves the gm brand most of the coffees are mild even when they say medium roast i go for a little more on the medium roast like the some of the tully and caribou brands it used to be that we were always ordering the same brands once we liked a certain one but i to try the wolfgang puck line while this flavor is touted as a medium roast it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness it is still not a bad coffee just not as good as the rodeo drive or breakfast in bed k cups which has no bitterness i must say though we have now added the latter flavors of wolfgang to our buying ritual ,wolfgang puck k cups , not my favorite
i like a dark rich coffee and this is a tad different it seems much smoother and br i tend to nearly crave it when i have a slightly acid stomach it sounds odd and br i know i drink too much coffee but this fills that acid tummy niche ,smooth rich , not as good as it is
tried this for the first time this week and it is now my favorite coffee with a hint of flavor coconut full bodied and no after taste jamaica me crazy is just what i love for an afternoon pick me up or to wake up and have an immediate smile on my face seriously it is awesome highly recommended ,awesome taste , great taste
my husband likes strong coffee i like medium neither one of us like this particular one there just is not much flavor of any kind coffee or caramel we like the vanilla one much better we will drink this until it is gone but it is the last flavor we choose and it is lasting way too long ,bland , good coffee
the taste is fine but the k cup container has opened at the seal during the brewing process on more than one occasion resulting in a mouthful of coffee grounds i have never had this happen with any other brand of k cup before and hope it is not the norm for wolfgang puck ,k cup problem , not good
i prefer the extra bold coffees so this one really lacking on the flavor it is fairly weak at the smallest cup setting its drinkable but i will not be buying it again i would recommend the timothy world coffee rainforest decaf espresso instead ,just ok , not as good as it is
wolfgang reserve columbian decaf is probably the best decaf we have had in a k cup very good cup of coffee ,k cup fan , good coffee
this is a coffee that i look forward to drinking as soon as i wake up very nice ,delicious , great coffee
light vanilla favor not overpowering nice coffee the first box that was purchased was too light on the vanilla flavor and aroma surprisingly the nd box was much better one of my new favorites ,light vanilla flavor , great coffee
we love our keurig coffeemaker and have tried many coffees recently discovered wolfgang puck new line of coffees and are pleased with all of his we have tried this one is smooth with a great flavor no bite we would purchase this again ,great coffee , great coffee
this is a mild but delicious coffe some might say a dessert coffee i really liked it as a pleasant change from full bodied flavors ,good coffee , good coffee
was looking for a strong k cup that could hold up for the perfect espresso and for a great cup of coffee now receiving on auto ship if you are looking for a great bold k cup this is it ,perfect espresso k cup , great coffee
i read several great reviews on this coffee on another site and decided to give it a try it is now one of my favorites and i will be ordering it again the taste is great sweet but bold enough that i can do a large size and it still have flavor ,one of my favorites , great coffee
great coffee has a nice bold taste for a medium roast coffee this is my new favorite give it a ,excellent coffee , coffee
i bought a two pack at the friday sale for reasonable but not an amazing deal i have been pleasantly surprised by the taste i do like the van whatever flavor french vanilla k cups and this contains significantly milder flavoring of a good tasting coffee br i would and have served it to company and highly recommend serving with milk or cream br br if you like flavored coffees you will most likely enjoy this one if you like it plain and black you will probably hate this ,smooth mild flavor not as flavored as other brands , good coffee
nice medium coffee blend that has a hint of vanilla and a touch of sweetness if you like a href http www amazon com gp product b emeril vanilla bean bam medium roast coffee for keurig brewers count k cups pack of a or a href http www amazon com gp product b i gloria jean coffees cappuccino for keurig brewers count k cups pack of a you should like this blend br br i drink this as an afternoon or dessert coffee with a splash of milk and a sugar packet br br stars because i would like just a touch more vanilla flavor br br we ordered another box of this coffee and the vanilla flavor seemed to be a little stronger than our first box ,medium roast touch of not acidic great with milk , good coffee but not a great price
taste is okay not blown away hidden is the fact that this is truly a decaffeinated coffee only place to find this out is on the bottom of the box not what i want first thing in the morning ,just okay decaf , not as good as it is
i am not a fan of flavored coffee and i thought i had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did i see any indication that it was a flavored coffee i wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by amazon were so that there is no as to what you are purchasing even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is jamaican coffee ,flavored , not as good as i be
i use to purchase jamaica beans locally and it was great this jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it the odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale other people in household tried it and could not get past the first cup pitched the remainder cups in the trash ,jamaica me crazy terrible , great coffee
this coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong but i have to say it almost ruined my months old keurig personal brewer the coffee is ground so finely that when the k cups are punctured by the needles top and bottom it gets packed into the needles and also out through the holes made by the needles going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty sludge in the bottom of each cup i purchased a pack of k cups and did not even use one full pack i do not recommend this brand or blend it is a waste of money which is something i could not really afford at this time i sent a letter of complaint to the wolfgang puck company and except for a cookie cutter letter receipt of my comment i have not received any further contact from them ,do not waste your money or your keurig on this , great coffee
unfortunately i am much too frugal to throw away something i have spent perfectly good money on so i am continuing to use these suckers until they are gone hopefully in a few weeks i thought i was buying a decent brand of coffee given the wolfgang puck name but alas i was wrong using the middle cup size on my keurig coffeemaker these k cups make a weak cup of coffee more like brown water no taste no nothing i switched to the smallest size cup and it is marginally better but still barely drinkable i would not serve these to guests ever i cannot wait to be done with these boxes of junk so i can order something with some taste please do not waste your money ,what a waste of money , not as good as i have
this was terrible coffee wolfgang pucks i received a partial refund but felt i should have gotten a full refund as i cannot drink the coffee and had to throw it all away also had to pay shipping and should not of had to i would like a response to this ,bad tasting coffee , not as good as it is
i found the taste and strength of this coffee just right for it to gain the of one of my go to coffees for my keurig not too strong or bitter i rather enjoy the flavor sadly with the recent k cup by green mountain coffees it looks like amazon is not carrying the wolfgang puck coffees any longer and my subscribe and save and my business will need to go elsewhere definitely give this coffee a shot if you can ,a pleasing cup of coffee , not good
the aroma is pleasant and flavor is nice and smooth but it is very very weak i really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save but i just cannot recommend it even making smaller cups it is very weak i am going to stick to newman own organics extra bold as my go to k cup for now ,nice flavor but very weak , good but not great
i had tried green mountain sumatra reserve and found it delicious and strong it is not available on subscribe and save so i read the reviews and opted for wolfgang puck my husband likes it and i like the flavour but it is very weak in comparison to the green mountain i have to order something else for me ,weak , not as good as it is
we love hazelnut coffee but this just did not have enough coffee flavor in it for me kind of on the weak side in my opinion i will keep looking ,meh okay not great , great coffee
love this coffee the aroma is as delicious as the flavor my husband would typically have a cup of coffee once or twice a month now he is having a cup several times a week ,great find , great coffee
i admit i am not terribly fond of flavored coffees but this one is not for us we both love the rodeo drive i have a good that loves this coffee i sent her ours ,crazy flavor , great coffee
i found this coffee to be great at first but as i started having it more and more i came to it on the large setting the coffee is way too watery also the flavor is very very overpowering and kind of tastes like bananas br br it is a pretty good mid afternoon or evening desert coffee but other than that it is kinda gross ,flavor and watery coffee lovers beware , not as good as i be
i am definitely not a coffee connoisseur but this stuff is bad it is a disappointment because i expected a wolfgang puck product to have more class this tastes artificial and it cannot stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener will not buy again ,what a disappointment , not as good as it is
the coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt i cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt will not order this again ,not good , good coffee
i am amazed that people are happy with this product i am not a drinker of the dark brews french roast or anything but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee this is completely tasteless the initial scent is delicious too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee ,really , not as good as it is
i got this through a decaf keurig assortment pack also from amazon and while i have enjoyed all of the flavors was so weak i had to post a review ,no flavor very weak , not as good as it is
to me this coffee was extremely bitter i dumped it out and made a different cup it made me afraid to try other wp coffees but i did like the wp sumatra kopi raya br br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano br br my favorite k cups are br starbucks french roast br starbucks caffe verona br starbucks pike place roast br green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve br green mountain double black diamond br green mountain revv br green mountain dark magic br br other k cups i have tried coffee people jet fuel green mountain dark magic decaf emeril jazzed up decaf starbucks caffe verona coffee people black tiger starbucks house blend starbucks breakfast blend starbucks sumatra wolfgang puck french roast green mountain lake and lodge green mountain french roast caribou mahogony wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya emeril big easy bold ,bitter , i not not my favorite
the brand br br so wolfgang puck got the tried different flavors this one sorrento is not my favorite of the bunch currently colombian chef reserve it has a bolder strength which i believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider medium but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it cream and sweetener do not correct for this and thus i am a bit disappointed but again it was a in the dark br br i think if you prefer a slightly bolder slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee this may be for you i like the character of the colombian chef reserve but it is not as strong and perhaps that is just what my taste is towards i do not believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the wolfgang puck line however cannot say the same for some other k cup brands ,not a fan of this blend , not as good as it is
this wolfgang puck coffee jamaica me crazy is the worst coffee i have ever had br i threw it out right away after one sip it taste like all coconut flavoring br hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was they should be fired ,worst coffee i have ever had , not as good as it is
ugh no where on the amazon page for this item did it state that it was hazelnut flavored i have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it thought it was going to be a blue mountain like jamaican coffee ,hazelnut , not as good as it is
this coffee is only mediocre in quality i do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do i like it when the coffee within weeks of the order date the only reason i am not more with this lousy coffee is that i paid very little for it by using a credit i had at amazon i do not recommend this coffee ,mediocre , good coffee
it is a medium roast pleasant coffee comparable to green mountain breakfast blend i bought it with a very good deal though ,good coffee good deal , good coffee
making such a bad cup of coffee so i tried again a week later with same results i use average to good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like green mountain nor emeril everyone i know that has a keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup usually the results are stunning and the keurig lives on when i share i will stick with offering the coffee peoples black tiger or jet fuel now i have more wp fr k cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of let me know if you want them as i would be embarrassed to even give them away sorry wolfgang but what the puck your french roast is horrible and at k cup prices i will not be again i will stay away from any of the other wp offerings ,simply it is terrible , not my favorite
this stuff tasted like tobacco smells my son did not like it either and i ended up throwing it out ,horrible , not as good as
i got the coffee for per box ordered boxes such a great deal as the coffee is a great blend br br if anyone is upset because of the website having issues when they were trying to buy it they should not review the product poorly as it is not the product that is the problem br br the problem is that you are jealous you did not get such a great deal on the coffee grow up kids this coffee is great will buy from amazon com llc again for more k cups for my keurig br br all of my coffee arrived packaged well and in new condition nothing wrong with it ,just got the coffee love it , good coffee
highly recommended for those who appreciate a good dark roast coffee wolfgang sumatra kopi raya the flavor buds and one morning always a good start to any day ,satisfying , great coffee
ok today this company decided to put them up for sale at per pk this advertisement was on net br br well went to order and refreshed the page and in my cart was now at dollars so they sold one out of my cart br next i waited mins to see if it was a fluke and net started claiming dead link br br well upon refreshing again they were now for one pack br br hey ridiculous seller get with the program if this is your way of quick money i think people are much then that upon pressing confirm my order round of to you for being so un tech ,never got a and still , not as good as it is
no thanks kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard organic bold and donut shop are still our ,bitter w of , good flavor
the worst it is just plan awful bitter and strong and you cannot taste the hazel nut flavor at all do not buy this product save your money ,the worst coffee , not as good as it is
k cups are marginally better than good coffee that i can buy at the store for the price or less this product was offered at and i was willing to purchase it but it immediately went up to it is not really worth and is certainly not worth any increase additionally what is the deal on offering instant coffee in k cups for leaving us to think it is a good deal on real coffee do you want to lose our trust business that is a good way to do it br ,wolfgang k cup , great coffee
i thought this coffee was really horrible had one cup and will throw the rest away because it cannot be returned ,taste like old , not as good as
i ordered the vanilla coffee for my college age children unfortunately there were shipping delays and it did not arrive until the kids had returned to college for the fall update to come when they finally come home for a break it may be a while the other coffees i have ordered have all been tasty and a very good value i have no reason to believe this will be any different i can say that the k cups and the keurig have been delightful i enjoy having a freshly brewed cup every time and like that i save a bunch of money by brewing at home into a travel mug rather than stopping to drop for a cup on the way to work saves all those styrofoam cups too ,cannot much , not as good as i have
i bought both the creme caramel and this hazelnut kcup and i could not tell them apart even if my life on it the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too and unlike the caramel one this one has a nasty bitter aftertaste like the flavor is artificial yeah i know it is artificial but i hate that it actually tastes like a chemical yuk br br this is one of those coffees you can serve to company who does not know good coffee or people you do not want to have come to your house any more as one cup of this and they will not be your friends after it it really is quite bad ,yuk aftertaste and weak coffee make this one to , not as good as i be
definitely not extra bold medium roast at best not particularly memorable doesn t have a good coffee aroma but it is pretty decent tasting at this point i am not sure if i would reorder ,not extra bold , not good
this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good dont buy this coffee this is a review of people there are people in my shop we all hate it not good ,horrible coffee , good coffee
i am not a coffee snob if i was i doubt i would own a keurig i just want a decent tasting cup of coffee with little cleanup br br i ve tried many of the flavored coffees but they are too for me starbucks brand tastes burnt to me even their roast in stores i mean i have not tried the starbucks brand kcups br br i like this breakfast blend because it is not too dark not too light it tastes like what no coffee should taste like i order the biggest size to get the best value br br update i just tried to create a review for the jamaica me crazy coconut flavor which i thought was terrible and i love coconut i should specify that the original review was for breakfast in bed ,great balance , not as good as other
i was so excited to try a new bold coffee needless to say i am disappointed i would rate this coffee as a medium if it would have been listed as a medium i would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a medium strength coffee in taste and flavor i will still drink it from time to time flavor is smooth not bitter overall i wish that i would have ordered some more jet fuel or black tiger ,disappointed this is not bold coffee , not good
i do like this coffee but even with subscribe and save amazon price is higher than k cups at bed bath beyond convenience is one thing but since there are bb all around me it is pretty easy to pick up my coffee there and save a few bucks i wish amazon would price their coffees more i would buy here exclusively if they did but this is good medium roast coffee not quite as strong as i would like but a little stronger than the breakfast in bed version i may need to try sorrento and see if it is a little bolder ,good stuff but overpriced , not as good as i have
so here is another example of a pack of k cups i bought i figured well i really enjoy sumatra bold smooth and rich with a bit of bitterness flaver so why not wolfgang puck has a few restaurants so maybe he knows coffee br br so this is utterly average in all it is not very bold or rich although i can say it does have the bitterness which is a bit as it lacks the richness purchased only because it appeared on the subscribe save at a great price per k cup that makes two wp that have been run of the mill at best sumatra french roast next time i will be more discerning ,average from wolfgang puck , great coffee
i really like to mix things up with k cups and rarely buy ct boxes of a single flavor exception to the rule would be for dark bold coffees such as french roasts which i really enjoy so when wolfgang puck french roast turned up on amazon deal of the week even though i have never tried before now i have units br br it fairly non for a french roast decent aroma but taste is compared to for example a diedrich french roast i do not hate or even dislike it it is okay and for the price i paid is acceptable without complaint it may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich br br i d call it mildly bold average and i will not be going out of my way to keep it on hand ,average quality french roast , great product
my favorite k cup so far absolutely no aftertaste which in my book is a huge plus it is not acidic not bitter just a great mild cup of coffee which is exactly what it to be i wish other people would read the description before they give a bad review based on their own do not buy a medium roast coffee and complain because it is not bold also as a general rule the ones with breakfast in the name are milder i do not care for bold dark roast slap you awake coffee so i would not buy a bold coffee and then complain that it was bold ,great mild cup of coffee , good coffee but not a great price
i have read so many reviews on the many brands and varieties of k cups coffee preferences are so subjective i did like the flavor of this coffee bold but not bitter as to strength i wish that there was more coffee in each k cup i am accustomed to starbuck strength and i have to set my keurig to medium cup size to get the strength i need this is not as cost effective as say jet fuel but i found jet fuel too bitter br if wolfgang puck would add more coffee to its k cups this would be a perfect coffee for me ,well but weak , not as good as i have
wolfgang puck breakfast in bed is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one ,nothing special , great coffee
this coffee has a very tropical taste to it so it is perfect for iced coffee on a hot day the flavor is not bad when heated but it just seems a little odd br br you do not usually think of tropical beverages being hot ,best iced k cup i have had , good coffee
we have been enjoying our order of w puck sumatra kopi raya dark roast coffee k cups for the last week we find the delicious flavor very satisfying not so strong to be bitter and not so weak as to taste like colored water the coffee is perfect there is just the right amount of to make it an enjoyable coffee experience and it carries a nice lingering pleasant flavor and aroma it is not as strong as an espresso but maybe one step below like we said pleasant smooth and flavorful ,smooth and flavorful cup of coffee , good coffee but not a great price
i am not a fan of any of the decaf k cups i have tried but this one is probably the best i like strong coffee and his comes pretty close to what i would expect although it says medium roast ,pretty good for decaf , not as good as it is
i was intrigued how this particular blend got such an exotic name and i was not disappointed there is an ever so slight coconut aftertaste that makes this so delicious i do not like strong coffee and this is perfect for my husband and i i get it send regularly now and it is one of our favorites second only to jamaica me crazy by wolfgang puck wolfgang is much tastier than the other brands ,yummy , great taste
i tried this coffee on a half dozen this weekend and they all loved it for those that like their coffee mild i brewed oz cups for those of us that like it bold i brewed oz cups br br as an earlier posted noted it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees the taste is not obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee regular and black but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention br br i plan on trying all of wolfgang line wish he would offer a variety pack ,flavored medium coffee , good coffee but not a great price
this is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe it is artificially flavored and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it my household hated it of course that would be my problem if the description was accurate but it is not amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page ,warning this is a flavored coffee , not as good as it is
wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut is the best k cup hazelnut and i have tried them all we ordered this large pack because we sadly found out that wolfgang puck is discontinuing many not all of their k cups including this flavor buy this while you can ,the best hazelnut k cup , great coffee
so far of all the decaf kcups we have tried this is our favorite wish it were on the automatic ordering system coffee is such an individual like or dislike but when we use it with an oz cup of water it is great ,great coffee , great coffee
i bought the kuerig because i love the dunkin original and green mountain nantucket blend rodeo drive has now become my favorite it is very delicious and smooth ,best k cup coffee , great coffee
when i feel that i do not need more caffine i have found that the wolfgang puck decaf is a great substitute i really cannot tell the difference taste wise i had been having trouble finding a good decaf i think this one is it ,wolfgang puck decaf cannot miss , good coffee
sometimes i feel when i reach for a decaffeinated k cup that i am going to settle for less flavor however i am completely happy with this product i do not feel i am missing anything everyday i treat myself to a relaxing cup of coffee after work before starting dinner this product just fits what i am looking for ,what a great cup of coffee , good coffee
i got a k cup sample box of this coffee from and i find that it is my favorite decaf coffee it brews a smooth tasting cup of coffee every time i add some and a bit of equal and it is a treat any time br glad to have found this coffee ,enjoyable flavor , good coffee
wolfgang puck coffees are very good this particular flavor of decaf is delicious does not taste like decaf at all very rich flavorful also this was a very good value for the price i have recommended this product to several friends ,great decaf coffee , good coffee
my wife and i have decided hands down this is our favorite k cup we have tried a lot of others and donut shop and caribu daybreak are certainly still up there however this has a very solid body flavor with a medium roast almost a bold flavor with a smooth finish excellent flavor versus strength really nice to get up on a lazy sunday morning and have a nice cup of breakfast in bed br br also i see another reviewer had problems with messy k cups i can say after about boxes of theses i have not had any issues very unfortunate for the other reviewer but looks like it was rather br br give it a try you will certainly enjoy it the wife and i sure do ,my favorite k cup , great coffee
who prefer a strong dark cup of coffee even at the larger mug setting should try that brand br br previously i had found the dark roast green mountain coffees rather boring but revv lives up to the hype both in strength and flavor another great green mountain coffee is their espresso blend though amazon does not stock it so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick and mortar stores such as bed bath and beyond finally a favorite regular over the years has been a href http www amazon com gp product b m w yq emeril big easy bold a it is a very nice coffee though do not expect the new orleans experience of chicory flavor br br bottom line you will not go wrong with the wolfgang puck coffees but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees ,unremarkable , unremarkable
i am usually a non flavored coffee drinker but i do like to mix things up every now and again this is a lightly coconut flavored coffee the coffee itself is a medium brew and it goes well with the tropical of the coconut it is a nice summer drink ,light coconut flavored coffee , delicious
i love quite a few coffees but this one is grabbing my whole attention it is not bitter but it is not light either it is perfect i love it ,rodeo drive delicious coffee , great coffee
i switched to decaf and was looking for a decent cup on the keurig machine i was only interested in subscribe and save options br br this is a fairly light roast which i like i brew on the middle setting and i think if it was brewed any larger i would think it was too light ,pretty good decaf , good coffee
of all the k cup flavors that are out there and there are many very good ones this is one of my least favorites and i have tried almost all of them not much flavor to this one even if you add various types of creamers of course it is all a matter of taste but this one does not taste all that good it is not bad it is just kind of there like a generic coffee try something else instead ,not my favorite , not as good as it is
absolutely love wolfgang puck rodeo drive k cups it is the best nice rich flavor but not too strong best one yet ,k cup coffee , great coffee
i have purchase this coffee several times my husband said it has a great taste and it is a good cup of coffee ,wolfgang puck coffee rodeo drive blend medium roast k cup for keurig , great coffee
of this freshly made joe the smell would really tempt me to go back to consuming coffee again eventually it broke me down and i am back to being a full time coffee drinker and proud of it imagine how happy i was to find my favorite brew in a k cup the only thing better than a cup of me crazy is a cup sweetened with the new almond joy flavor international creamer in it to highlight the sweet coconut unfortunately we only have a keurig at our office i m in real estate now so i have to go to work to enjoy a cup i am thinking i have a brilliant boss who knows how to get people to willingly show up to work now if i can just figure a way to use it to temp more buyers into our office i would have it made ,jamaica me happy , great product
i bought this grudgingly because my favorite timothy italian blend was out of stock and i was very happily surprised it is not as big and winey a brew as my favorite but was flavorful had a delicious aroma and was smooth i tend to like rather potent coffee but i have clients who prefer a little lighter cup this will be perfect i will happily keep buying this coffee thanks wolfgang ,nice mellow cup of coffee , great coffee
i think this is a love it or hate it kind of coffee i love it the flavor starts out similar to butter toffee but then sort of into coconut pineapple and rum i think it is delicious and unique and i do not ever want to be without some in my cupboard ,so good , delicious
this one will not disappoint i got this yesterday and my husband and i tried it this morning with breakfast and we both loved it i have gotten many different kinds of the k cups to try but after trying this one i think i could be happy with just this one and black tiger for those mornings when i want a really strong cup of coffee the rodeo drive blend is delicious with a nice round feel on the palate and an interesting flavor on the finish with just a hint of smokiness perfectly balanced and absolutely wonderful plus i have to admit i love the label the different color looks very appealing on my with the other k cups ,new favorite , great coffee
we have tried many of the k cups that are available and this is in our top we prefer a darker bolder flavor and this one hits the mark at the same time it is quite smooth ,one of the best k cups , great coffee
my husband i both like a mild tasting coffee we thought we would give wolfgang puck breakfast in bed a try we were pleasantly surprised by the full bodied taste but without the bitterness of some of the stronger tasting coffee we are very satisfied and will be drinking this for a long time now if i can only get my husband to take the name literally ,mild and flavorful , good coffee
this k cup is one of my favorites along with coffee people jet fuel and black tiger if you like a strong rich coffee this will fit the bill ,rich tasting coffee , great coffee
not too strong not too weak smooth without the bitterness great anytime for those not into the strong grow hair on your chest types we will continue to purchase this as a part of our favorite brands ,a winner cup of coffee , great taste
wolfgang rodeo drive does make a good ole cup of coffee it is on the same line as donut shop very good morning coffee to wake up with ,k cup fan , great coffee
the coffee was more on the light side rather than medium roast i do not think i would purchase it again even though it was a good value purchase ,wolfgang puck coffee for keurig , good coffee
i have tried several decaf k and have found this to be the best my husband does not like decaf but has finally found this one he will drink because it has a little bolder taste i find it a good coffee to have in the house for company because everyone seems to like it i will be ordering it again and again ,decaf , not as good as it is
this coffee is for those who like a strong robust flavor nothing wimpy about it i like just enough cocoa mix and creamer to take off the edge my husband goes for the gusto great wake me up in the morning brew love it ,good stuff , not as good as it is
this is an excellent blend perfect for any time was really surprised by the quality flavor and finish ,great coffee , great coffee
as coffee these kcups are just ok as flavored coffee these are disappointing i found the vanilla to be barely detectable ,barely any vanilla aroma or flavor , good coffee
after receiving this coffee i made a few cups it was fairly smooth not too overpowering and had a slight mocha aroma it is ok coffee i likely will not purchase this one again because there are so many better ones to gauge my review for others my favorites are coffee people donut shop green mountain dark magic coffee people organic bold emeril big easy bold and tully kona blend ,ok coffee but not the best by far , good coffee
nice smooth cup of joe high recommend not sure why there is not more reviews ,good stuff , good but not great
this coffee was in a sample selection when we ordered our keurig brewer it was by far our favorite i have ordered this coffee several times from amazon it is a dark roast but not too strong ,wolfgang puck coffee sumatra for keurig , great coffee
you get a consistent cup of coffee with a hint of hazelnut a cup of hot coffee in about seconds that tastes great what is not to like about that ,tastes great , great coffee
these have a stronger caramel flavor although still a medium strength coffee the best caramel flavored k cup i have tried i will reorder them ,best caramel k cup , great product
i want to try other types of coffee but i am so stuck on this one that it is hard to try anything else this is a mild roast medium or dark roast is too strong for me these days the hazelnut flavor it very nice and every cup brewed is superb i have been drinking this wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut for at least months and it never to please give it a try ,love love love this coffee , great coffee
love this rodeo drive it has a very drinkable taste is also good and it is smooth i recomend that you try this one ,one of the better k cups i have tried , great coffee
this is the most delicious coffee ever it does not mess up your stomach it is amazing and tastes wonderful and everyone at work loves it too ,delicious , great coffee
k cups this is the only place i can find them so i hope amazon never stops selling them here they are mellow medium roast and i enjoy them every day any other brand is just a back up try them i have never had any trouble with any of the cups and i am on my third order now of cups if they had a problem they have fixed it br br this is an update being done on july i continue to drink at least two cups of this coffee every day it has ruined me for other coffees as i measure every other cup against this incredible wolfgang puck decaf k cup please please please amazon make this part of your subscription service my head hurts trying to make sure that i always remember to order so as not to ever be out of this wonderful coffee ,favorite , great coffee
i really like medium strength coffee but this is a little too bold to be considered medium it is almost bitter when compared to other medium coffees ,almost bitter , good coffee
great product to start your am with as its not too strong but just the right tast for your morning wake us up ,breakfast delight , great product
this coffee is okay but certainly not as good as green mountain breakfast blend it just does not taste as good ,okay but not great , good coffee
this is a great flavored coffee nevertheless k cups are getting too expensive for everyday home use i am now using the filler and using my own ground coffee much of the time it is also helpful to look for other price alternatives ,tasty but expensive , great coffee
i roast my own colombian beans at home so i have a perfect for reference right off the bat let me say that just like their sumatran reserve this k cup is not bitter but smooth the aftertaste is also smooth my complaint is it does not taste like a colombian bean it really is missing the deep flavor of a columbian coffee while the sumatran puck k cup definitely has a sumatran taste the brand you see in many grocery stores has a more distinct flavor than this k cup that being said my final recommendation is that i would the puck sumatran over this if you like a distinct coffee flavor however if you are looking for a not too stong but not bitter coffee this colombian is a great choice i would buy this again just because of the smooth taste ,great but not perfect , good coffee but not a great price
i have always been drawn to k cup varieties with out there names jet fuel black tiger and distinctive flavors golden french toast spicy chocolate this offering those two features into something i am happy to wake up to br br to me jamaica me crazy definitely got a coconut taste fairly similar to dunkin donuts coconut flavored coffee but it is also got a lot of the flavor characteristics i have come to expect from k cup chocolate brews barely any of that acidic aftertaste that is almost with artificial flavors and definitely not as watery as many other k cup varieties sure the name pretty corny and the taste is hardly subtle or but that is what makes this cup of joe so fun ,spicy , not as good as it is
my pomeranian loves these treats he eats one every morning they do smell a little but that is probably why he loves to eat them i have ordered these many times and never had a problem with them being opened when they arrive ,my loves these treats , great treat
my girl has loved these for two years when the local retail outlet trader joes no longer carried them we found the manufacturer this is one of the few treats girl enjoys ,favorite , great product
i purchased two of these and they arrived with the package split and the items all over the box i contacted amazon and they sent two more out these also arrived with the packages open amazon was very courteous and professional as always i cannot review the item itself because the packaging is so horrible that i have given up on trying again ,horrible packaging , good but not great
sorry as i stated on my other reviews my german breed g is very picky and he just did not care for the smell of these beef rolls he did not even care to come close to take nd sniff sorry no star but it me to give it as least star to continue my review ,sorry no good , not as good as it is
i purchased this for my wife birthday dinner i never tried this brand of before it was delicious the sausage was excellent the duck was good the general flavor was superb ,terrific , delicious
of the highest quality my cats cannot get enough of it and the price is very competitive especially if you are a prime member br br still in doubt try this test br br open a can of your current cat food and smell it then compare that to any flavor of merrick it will not turn your stomach br br when it says fish there are huge chunks of you guessed it fish not a weird looking grey or stinky brown paste that you could mistake for what comes out the other end but actual food in a can speaking of which the post meal litter box period is reduced as well as is volume less to clean br br give it a try remember to mix it with your old food for a day to two to ease the transition but your cats will thank you for it ,my cats love this stuff , great food for cats

licorice has no flavor very hard to eat it was in a seal bag but it hard not soft like other licorice ,licorice , the best licorice
good coffee however i have been disappointed with the senseo coffee pods that are made in by douwe egberts the pods are not individually wrapped and the coffee often does not taste fresh the pods also contain too little coffee which results in a weak watery brew the flavored senseo french vanilla caramel bistro coffee pods seem to me to be better than most senseo blends that i have tried in general i prefer to buy pods from timothy world coffee the timothy pods contain almost twice as much coffee as the senseo pods and the resulting coffee is superior in my view i have found that the timothy pods will work well in the senseo machine if the pod is and before the lid i use the single pod holder and make a ounce cup if you must use the senseo pods made by douwe egberts try this blend ,better than most , not bad but not great
coffee pods used to be sold in safeway and target etc stores in my area in the last year the pods have not been stocked in favor of the new single brewer style k cup while i can locate many sources on the internet i have found that quickest delivery at a reasonable price is buying senseo from amazon br mostly a french vanilla drinker i find the taste is the packages keep fresh for months i typically buy pods per order the pods work very well in my bunn coffee maker tea brewer single serve i wish every item i purchased was as easy reliable and quick as these coffee pods ,senseo coffee pods , great coffee
these pods are rather bland i purchased them because i thought they would make a nice dessert coffee they do not taste much different than regular coffee pods i would not purchase them again nor do i recommend them ,bland , good coffee
i purchased these pods using amazon subscribe and save program for the first time this year the order was received promptly and the pods were fresh and very flavorful i have used this flavor coffee pods since january and have not been disappointed ever hopefully i will be able to continue receiving them from amazon ,senseo coffee pods , great coffee
have a senseo coffee maker given to me a few years ago for more than a year could not find pods sold any more in local supermarkets even at the big w just happened to come across them at amazon went on auto ship every few months for additional savings i have always liked the french vanilla so no problem there still like fresh brewed better but if you want a quick cup of coffee these are perfect i am just happy that i did not the coffee maker will next look for the sumatra pods my other favorite ,senseo pods not easy to find , good coffee but not great
i enjoy flavored coffees french vanilla is a favorite i only wish senseo would offer more flavor varieties it would also be nice if a variety of flavored coffees could be sold as a pack of example hazelnut and french vanilla or of different varieties these pods are easy to use and cheaper than area store prices it is more convenient to purchase online not all stores carry pods for senseo coffee makers ,senseo french vanilla coffee pods , great coffee
i just love the french vanilla coffee it is gives my day a great start easy to use one cup at a time with no waste ,delicious , great coffee
i love senseo paris it is easy fast and great tasting with never that chemical aftertaste of so many of the french vanilla coffees amazon is the only place i can find it consistently so i have it on the subscription plan thanks amazon and senseo ,great product hard to find except at amazon , great product
this batch was horrible since most regular coffee were out of stock i tried this one it tastes and smells awful do not buy this flavor ,awful smell and taste , not as good as it is
non natural ingredients in the quest for larger profits which is a sad senseo you need to start using natural vanilla flavor instead of artificial for the health of your customers br br but i still love the taste and cant drink any other coffee the senseo coffee in general is so wonderful i have gone through two machines already the of senseo coffee is so delightful its like only better i use silk vanilla creamer too which gives it an even better taste their product does have the natural vanilla flavor so maybe that is helping with the taste then i always top off my coffee with cinnamon sprinkles which makes it even more wonderful br br all in all a great coffee and coffee system just please start using natural flavor senseo for the health of your customers you would probably have even more customers if you did ,awesome coffee , not bad
although it sounded delicious i was very disappointed in this coffee the coffee has a strange chemical aftertaste cup after cup not just once even when it brews it creates a chemical sort of aroma in fact because our single serve pod coffee brewer was new i started thinking the problem was the brewer we assumed it was a left over manufacturing plastic or metal aftertaste coming through in the water i even e mailed the coffee machine maker bunn to see how to remove the aftertaste imagine our surprise when a month later we opened a new pack of pods regular colombian not flavored and were delighted that our machine makes great coffee when we made a cup of the senseo vanilla again back came the off taste and aroma perhaps it is the artificial flavors used be forewarned ,aftertaste thought it was the but it was the coffee , not as good as i have
senseo paris french is one of my favorite senseo coffee always a great cup of coffee great price from amazon ,great coffee , great coffee
it is so easy to order our favorite coffee from amazon we love the taste of the coffee and ease in brewing it ,amazon to the for senseo french vanilla , great coffee
we go through a lot of this flavor love the senseo machine and their customer service love the ability to use different flavors of coffee and tea everyone can have their favorite in seconds we just use a lot of the french vanilla ,we love it , great product
good taste a little on the weak side especially since i mix it with half soy milk after it is brewed delicious nonetheless ,senseo vanilla coffee pods , good but not great
best coffee in the world i am so glad i found it here because other stores had stopped carrying flavors only regular ,love it , great coffee
the particular packages had an off taste however the seller gave me a complete refund and did not even make me send them back i have ordered this item before and they were fine ,i think i got a bad batch , good but not great
major gourmet coffee and to me this coffee has the best vanilla taste of them all it is great to use in a single serve type brew system or in a small cup brewer which is what i use the pod makes cleaning the brew basket a breeze and yet there is sufficient amount of grounds to give a good strength to the brew i do not like my coffee as strong as some so if i want more coffee i leave the pod in and simply run a quick second brew cycle if you like your coffee normal strength you would likely use a new pod for each cup brewed also this coffee is available in a subscribe and ship option which is a wonderful way of yourself of plenty of coffee at hand when you want it just choose the frequency of shipment and leave it to amazon ,great vanilla flavor , not for me
great coffee we mix it with godiva chocolate coffee or regular medium roast what a treat ,yum , great coffee
we have been purchasing this product for several months and have enjoyed it in the past but this order is inferior did the company change hands or their production ,what happened , not as good as it is
the senseo pod coffee maker is my favorite and paris french vanilla caramel bistro coffee pods are simply the perfect blend of richness and flavor the taste is not overwhelming or subtle but just right this is the perfect way to start your day ,absolutely delicious , great coffee
senseo pods are getting harder to find especially the paris vanilla caramel flavor i am happy to find these on amazon at a very good price especially at the subscription price ,good coffee for a good price , great coffee
my wife has one of the one cup coffee makers i used to make fun of her for the one cup thing but you know sometimes i only want one cup too the senseo pods have good flavor i would rate them a star but if you use only one pod the coffee is a little bit weak for my taste in the stores i have to pay over when i can find the french vanilla buying them on amazon in the pack of was much cheaper especially with the automatic re order discount ,makes a good cup of coffee , good coffee
am i glad i found these senseo paris french vanilla caramel bistro coffee pods all of my local stores either do not carry them anymore or are charging over for one count bag the bag pack should easily cover the month subscription time frame as i only use one pod a day the other great thing is that the package expiration date is many months in the future so i know they are fresh i highly recommend to the automatic re order system thank you amazon com ,so glad to find senseo coffee pods , great taste
is my favorite coffee maker of all the coffee pods i have tried from senseo and other brands i keep coming back to paris it is consistently a delight i have had trouble finding it in the market because of popularity and now flavored pods are becoming no problem i have my subscription to back me up and make it easy br br i love coffee and i do not drink a lot of it so i want something that is a delight and i want to be able to have a supply available so when i run out i do not have to go on a hunting to get it this plan is perfect for that need you can skip a shipment if need be or increase your order it is flexible more cost effect than the stores and reliable in availability br br what more could you want ,simply the best i order this makes it easy , great product
so far this has been a great way to order my favorite coffee it has become really hard to find it at the local stores but amazon had it even cheaper than i previously paid for it it arrived very quickly and i am waiting any day now for the next shipment ,great coffee great price , great coffee
the paris bistro is my nd favorite flavor for senseo it a nice mild flavor that does well for a late afternoon i have enjoyed senseo in europe for years on my visits there and waited till finally it was available here i get my regular douwe egberts coffee at a local european deli only one in the dallas worth that carries it i think americans expect stronger flavors in their coffee than the this is mildly flavored just the right touch ,love senseo , great coffee
hi coffee does not smell or taste great i recommend senseo vienna still have packages of paris and nobody wanna drink it guess i just have to throw it away ,smells and tastes , good coffee
i have tried other brands of french vanilla coffee and this is the best highly recommend it ,best of the best , great coffee
nice flavor and great aroma while brewing everyone is always jealous when i brew it at work ,nice quick cup of coffee , good coffee

the coffee i ordered is great if you want a sweet coffee this is for you ,great tasting coffee , good coffee
we got our senseo coffee maker through a promotion i had always wanted to try it out i purchased a variety of coffee pods and my husband and i tried them out we have yet to be disappointed we love it so much we have told several people about the senseo and they have gotten them as well this is a wonderful product and we waste a lot less coffee using the pods instead of making a pot of coffee in fact i think we drink a lot more coffee we want to try all the varieties of the senseo coffee pods pair the pods with the barista blend flavor packs sit back and enjoy ,i am , great coffee
the pods arrived fresh and quickly after ordering them by ordering the coffee through the program they are a good value the flavor is good slightly bitter after taste to this brand of coffee ,senseo coffee pods , good coffee
overall this makes a great fast cup of coffee especially if you are just going to add a flavored creamer or sweetener to it anyway i use two pods to make an oz cup of coffee and i am pleased overall with the strength ,wonderful aroma flavor needs to be , great coffee
they kept raising the price the product was great and remained the same but they kept raising the price this last order i have had enough and will be going back ,will be , great product
i am not a coffee snob barely drinking a cup a week but my significant other needs a strong every morning the pods and the senseo machine are perfect for this barely takes minutes to brew the pack box comes out to about cents a cup even with the added latte packets cents when two are used for a strong mug serving wonderful aroma and works well with the flavor packets i am hoping the money saved by avoiding starbucks every morning will go to my potato chip addiction ,perfect for the non coffee , great coffee
this is my first purchase of senseo coffee pods the package coming with the coffee machine is unflavored so i went online to buy this french vanilla from amazon price was surely attractive with this bulk purchase however i am not totally satisfied with the flavor comparing this with what i got from other coffee vendors e g the in my office building this french vanilla from senseo is good but is not strong enough anyway i am satisfied with this combination of price and quality and i will try a different flavor next time ,good flavor but not strong enough , great coffee
this is a great coffee with excellent flavor you can add an extra pod for a darker more robust coffee the aroma fills the air as your cup is being filled ,excellent flavor , great coffee
i have been a huge fan of the senseo coffee machine ever since i experienced one in france upon returning home i found one and have never looked back the paris french vanilla is my favorite and i often receive comments from others that it smells like pancakes after i have brewed a cup great stuff ,love my senseo , great coffee
it is a good coffee flavor i get it every months it is great to not have to think about getting the coffee it just comes to the door ,senseo french vanilla coffee pods , good coffee
as usual the coffee for the senseo coffee maker is outstanding the french vanilla has the flavor i prefer over the others ,great coffee , coffee
i love these coffee pods if you are into heavy cream heavy sugar heavy coco foam in your coffee you may not care smells wonderful tastes even better with the coffee maker you can have a cup of this great tasting coffee in about min if you are into the above mentioned additives any coffee will do br after this item being unavailable for a very long time i assumed they had stopped making it i was to receive a notice from amazon com that it was again available so i immediately placed my order i was dissappointed to learn that i will not be receiving my order for a month oh well it is the very best so if i must wait a month i will ,for real coffee , great coffee
excellent tasting will have to remember to order some more later br br ,senseo coffee french vanilla caramel , great taste
i love this coffee and it is so convenient to have it shipped to me automatically ,great coffee , great coffee
if this was called medium roast i would give it stars it is a good coffee br br but this is called french vanilla caramel and this review is based on the product name br br let me say that vanilla and caramel are perhaps my favorite flavors coffee ice cream candy you name it if it is vanilla or caramel i love it br br with the exception of this br br where the vanilla where is the caramel and do not get me wrong i am not trying to say that the flavors are too mild i am saying that they are non and therefore based on the name this coffee gets star ,disappointing , not as good as i have
good but folgers version is significantly better and so far amazon does not carry it good price though and i like the free shipping which i am not certain will last having a huge supply of these on hand makes it is hard to make coffee any other way though this is just sooo easy ,good but version is better , good coffee
so long as you have a pod type coffee machine the senseo pods in all their make a good cup of coffee easily if you drink one or two cups of coffee per day they are worth the price of the machine and the pods ,senseo coffee pods easy to good coffee , great coffee
this stuff is terrific it is been at least years since i have seen plum jelly or jam in stores in my area the taste of amish made plum jam was just as i remember it has a smooth texture and is sweet without being too sweet i will order this brand again ,old goodness , not as good as it is
this jam has little fruit taste if you love jam this is not the one for you it could have been any flavor all you taste is sweetness ,just ok , great taste
if you have not tried this combination you really should totally awesome flavor mix great on roast pork or to just dip pretzels in or put it over cream cheese and use crackers br would buy again great service and got here sooner than expected ,yummy , great product

if you go to the rumford web site you will see this br br in a co of the rumford company formulated and rumford baking powder the first calcium phosphate baking powder rumford baking powder quickly became widely since it achieved more dependable results and was less expensive than using crude formulas of cream of tartar and baking soda the calcium acid phosphate in rumford baking powder was also considered to be healthier than cream of tartar br br i had really disliked baking with regular baking powder since it was and bitter tasting this powder has no such problems and it works great also it has no aluminum in it unlike most commercial baking powders i discovered that many chefs and professional use it so i was happy to find a superior alternative to the regular common baking powders on the market ,the best baking powder you can buy , not as good as you are
i could not find rumford at the grocery just found brands with aluminum but of course amazon has it i have used this brand since i started cooking as a child at my parents house ,aluminum free have used for , not as good as it is

a thanksgiving day dinner i was impressed with it when i opened the can and my cats were when they ate it it contains nice size pieces of shredded turkey not too big making it easy for my kitties to eat they have gotten the tiki cat chicken before and the long pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when i would try to break them up not this i just it into their bowls and they took over from there there is liquid around the sides of the food in the center but the meat mix in the middle is well packed i did not feel like i was getting more liquid than food like halo foods so i was happy about that as well plus through amazon this is a great price for this quality food ,good product great price , good but not as good as i be
if you are new to this product you need to be very careful of it is strong some batches are stronger than others ,best tea for , great taste
good flavor unique in all the teas that i have tried br br this tea is effective for one system but is not as harsh as a regular laxative it can be consumed daily or as needed ,good effective product , great tea
i have used this brand for years if you are feeling clogged up or ate a meal have a few sips of this tea if you are new to it make sure you are home because it can work a little too well if you know what i mean just be careful the first couple of times using it and try little sips you will see a result by morning or earlier if you follow it with lots of water ,the best tea i have ever had , not as good as it is
i always have this in my house i drink it as is or my favorite is mix with sprite oh so good i have some every day i do not mind the larger bottles as i use so much of it bring it on ,i am an i still love this , best ever

i got this for my mom and she loved it she just got a tea maker and with this pack of discs each she is going to have a lot of tea i should not have the awake tea for her because it was only package with discs because it is more expensive oh well the thought that counts btw if you read this please check out my seller profile and items i sell i will star to sell stuff soon and once i talk with amazon i will let everyone choose super saver shipping i am a true seller and give the customers what they t in perfect condition anyways this tea is great and i reccomend this to everyone who loves tea ,awesome good green tea , not as good as i have

for the last year our tassimo machine has made only tea as all the coffees are greatly lacking instead we buy imported german coffees which are the best in the world br br we use teas the best is twinings earl grey br next best is twinings green tea br next best is awake black tea br br these teas are all great if you can get some good natural north honey to put in them you will like them even more ,better tea , great tea
i think i am not a green tea drinker this is pretty awful tasting stuff glad i bought just one bag because i am throwing it out ,tastes like water , great tea
in my opinion the best soda cracker on the planet if you like or love crackers diamond bakery makes the tastiest cracker ,soda crackers , the best
i have tried them all from the top name brands to the baked cheese crisps that seem to have become the these days these cheese puffs simply take the cake not only do the pack all the flavor and texture one would want but they are packed with the vitamins and proteins one needs imagine that a guilty treat like a cheese is now a healthy alternative ,over standard cheese , good but not great
this huge bag of chocolates contained old white and cracked chocolates that were completely melted all over the inside of the bag at work would even touch them since they looked so sad and gross what a waste and disappointment will be wary to ever purchase from this seller again ,disappointed , not as good as it is
this reminded me how much i enjoy indian pickle it was basically good pickle br problems br it seemed a bit stale br it was fairly pricey br but it did remind me that i really like indian pickle and told me that i could get it on the internet so i around a bit and found a place com in another of chicago which was closer i live in oak park so instead of it coming from texas it came from less than an hour drive away that solved the problem their prices seemed to be about of amazon prices i thank amazon for reminding me that i should look ,chili , not as good as it is
patak chilli pickle br this is a seriously good pickle from patak with lots of salty heat and endless chunky chilli pieces i bought it to dip in but finished the pot as an to slow cooked pork sausages and it worked beautifully certainly as well as a full bodied english mustard br br if you like a bit of heat as well as plenty of flavour you will enjoy it ,hot stuff , not as good as it is
my mother in law simply loves these candies she is on her fourth tub since christmas she prefers them over the sunkist fruit gems i hope they remain a stocked item ,keeps me in my in good , great for
soft and slightly chewy candy is optimal not gummy to me and these are that the flavors are good but not great they are heavily coated with sugar to sweeten them up as they are not sweet without the sugar coating i will purchase them again ,soft and slightly , not as good as
if you are looking for a sugar high then these are what you are looking for too sweet for me and my family i do not think we will be ordering these again ,too sweet , not as good as
i had a recipe that called for a lot of dark chili powder and the only place i could find it was amazon com i bought a jar of this and it made two batches of the chili recipe i have the chili was the best i would ever made i can vouch that this chili powder really does make a big difference in the flavor of a chili it is rich with a bit of a kick everyone has been crazy for it and i think its due to this chili powder i am back to buy the bag this time ,best chili powder i ever tried , the best
more iron than but this is a very nutty tasty spice that i mix with all other spices this is one of the main ingredients in most indian curry powders ,spice , great taste
without a doubt this is hands down the best coconut water product i have tried the others i have experienced have a flat or slightly bitter taste but this one has that subtle essence and sweetness of coconut water drank directly from a freshly opened raw coconut let me tell you this is the most refreshing hydrating and re you can partake of i will take this over gatorade any day of the week great way to start off any day ,from the coconut , the best
best coco water bring back br i ve been drinking it for the last years and this one only liter pack is really the best br the seems to have discontinued it what a shame br the small size product is not at all good only this one br hope this company gets some common sense and continues this product which was so good br br one large stars br one small stars br one kids star br zico upsets stomach stars br vitacoco tastes awful star br stars br stars br c o stars br naked stars br nirvana stars ,best , best water ever
we drink this coconut water every day in our house it is become somewhat of an we used to have a subscription to the pack of vitacoco and when that ran out we tried this instead i like it better it tastes cleaner though i cannot describe what is different about it i just feel better after drinking this than drinking the vitacoco coconut water in general has an odd taste to it but it is still really sweet and feels so refreshing when you drink it if i am really hungry i drink this between meals and it is kind of like a protein shake or energy drink it settles my stomach and gives me a fantastic burst of energy ,refreshing and amazingly satisfying , the best
i make coconut water a part of my daily regimen whether i have or not it gives my body a much better and healthier boost than caffeine and gives me an overall feeling of well being i recommend this to everyone the only downside is one could go broke drinking a liter box every day like i have been doing ,a natural , great product
shipping better note however i was able to live with amazon and get a refund even though the item is a non returnable grocery item br and review of the drink the drink itself is superior to the taste of vita coca good or zico too sweet so as a drink the o n e really is like drinking from a real coconut out in the i am going back to the individual single serve containers of o n e shipped from amazon br and in a second comparison the multi pack of vita coca oz comes packaged in the shipping box from amazon as each oz container is protected in a cardboard sleeve br hope that helps and thank you amazon for letting me have a refund on the damaged box but it will be more helpful if you can protect the boxes better for shipping it to us ,review of amazon shipping but o n e drink , not as good as i be
of them an easy way to get potassium was what i was looking for but when i took my first sip i was hooked not only is this loaded with the potassium i needed for my leg cramps it has a mild pleasant flavor talk about refreshing i cannot wait for summer now there is an instant sensation a pleasant smooth mouth feel and a thirst quenching ability you wish a soda had i have tried other brands but they come across as raw or harsh for me o n e is the v s o p of coconut waters to me that means the best my shipment arrived earlier than expected and was in perfect shape if you want electrolytes in a delicious healthy form this is your stuff as far as my on ordering a twelve pack there ll be an order for another twelve pack arriving soon ,all around , a great product

my wife really loves o n e coconut water i thought via auto ship would be a great way not to have to go to the store every other day to get some i ordered cases of the first problem occurred when case number one was sent back as i guess a san diego address would be in kentucky of the remaining cases all of which did arrive but in not great condition all the cases were still sealed but had of the ounce boxes split open and there were other boxes in other cases that were stale really had a rancid smell therefore i cancelled the auto ship and have gone back to picking this up in the local supermarket works out better just more time consuming and heavier it would have been nice knowing that the cases were in fact pretty flimsy my wife still loves the product ,one coconut water love hate , water is the
if you love coconut water this kind is the must have i am on auto ship and it arrives on time and packaged to perfection to prevent damage ,fabulous , great product
we love coconut water some brands are really icky sold at safeway is really awful sweet and sickening made from concentrate br br o n e is a very good tasting product though zico is always my first choice but has a history of being out of stock so it is often a case of purchasing o n e because zico is unavailable o n e ships well i have never had one arrive leaking as i have often with zico ,o n e coconut water , great product
not amazon in any way i bought this last week never having tried coconut water before but i heard good things the taste of it was almost like the smell of lawn that had been damp and out in the sun for a long time tasted off and had a faint mold smell to it i did not know if it was supposed to taste like that or not as i never tried it before but paying as much as i did i felt to finish it off i have been ill for about a week after drinking it i do not know if it was just a or the cause of it i did email customer service at o n e the day i drank it asking if it was supposed to taste like that or if i got a bad batch and they still have not to me ,o n e awful experience , not as good as it is
coconut water and its many benefits are nothing short of phenomenal and i personally was so excited to have an opportunity to purchase in bulk br br what isnt phenomenal is that every single box in my shipments must have experienced some temperature changes or they were discounted because br of a faulty snap at any rate almost every single carton either came with the lid broken off gave out or it eventually breaks off br not such a big deal unless i want to take a carton with me ,coconut water is amazing this batch is not perfect , water
i was buying this product and others like it in the boxes but it saves a lot of money to purchase it in the liter packages the taste is great and the product was very fresh with a good shelf life since i have a prime account i received package in just days and with free shipping great deal if you like coconut water like i do ,coconut water , great product
i love the coconut water light and refreshing packed with potassium i was it down like well water daily i do not really enjoy plain water a lot of the time but this provided refreshment hydration and flavor without a lot of the junk and or calories that other drinks come with stars br br i was looking forward to continuing buying it and consuming it regularly with subscribe and save however br br price specifically change in price is terrible star i cannot say more ,rating average of and , great product
people watch out if you are buying this product online i have ordered bottles of the o n e i was expecting this to be same as what i bought from store but this seller disappointed me the bottles have the seal broken and the taste of the coconut water is not what i expected i am sure that this seller the person who packaged the bottles added water by breaking the seal i have wasted my money on this product i will never buy this online for a few bucks cheap rather than go to the nearby store and buy it br br my rating for this product is br br in short seal broken diluted and not comparable with the one that i bought from store ,do not buy this product from this , not as good as it is
i have tried several brands and this is true to the taste of fresh coconut water though slightly more dilute the wholesale price here does not make much sense to me it is about per liter in an pack i get it for at publix the only is that they only have maybe or at a time but i am one of few buying it and i the shelves of it lol br i am weeks pregnant and this helps decrease the in my legs and keeps me well hydrated i do not experience any leg cramps like i did during my first pregnancy i think the potassium makes a huge difference and with a tendency towards diabetes the low sugar content vs other sports drinks is a huge advantage they should market this directly to pregnant women with diabetes with no renal issues ,the best but not in price , best water ever
hi br i am very disappointed with the past shipment i received of the one coconut water of the boxes were leaking and the coconut water was spoiled br br thanks br br ,extremely , not as good as it is
i love this product i wanted something healthy and good tasting that did not have added sugar or chemical sweeteners as an alternate to water this is it i like this coconut water better than others i have tried it is not as sweet as the amy brian brand which i prefer i do not use sugar so i found this brand to be the best the taste has also been consistent since starting my use of this in april i have purchased four cases since june it also has a lot of health benefits ,o n e coconut water , not as good as it is
best coconut water i have tasted and i have tried plenty of other brands it is a must buy if you like coconut water ,great product , best water ever
this was not bad at all i had a bad experience with vitacoco acai and pomegranate and it was horrible it had that strong coconut flavor that i do not like i had already bought this so i was nervous to try it i was surprised when it barely tasted like coconut it does not have that typical strong coconut taste i usually stay away from anything coconut candy food beverages etc for some reason it gets me sick but i wanted to try this because i heard coconut water is good for you i already tried the mango pineapple and pink guava flavors they are delicious pink guava is my favorite o n e brand is my favorite as long as i do not really taste that strong coconut flavor then i will keep drinking this ,i hate coconut but , not as good as it is
this is the best coconut water cannot get enough it has such a smooth and pleasing taste vita coco is another wonderful product ,o n e coconut water , great product
if you drink coconut water this is the best commercial one no doubt consistently good and if you decide to subscribe that is even a better deal ,the best coconut water you will have , water
i get these for at my local health food store their price sucks it is one of the best tasting coconut waters around though ,love the water hate the price , great product
this is a new package of o n e coconut water the taste is completely different from previous packages it tastes like real coconut water from a coconut tree ,o n e coconut water ounce boxes pack of , great product
i have tried three brands of coconut water and this is my favorite it is sweet but naturally so unfortunately the price is a bit high for me if it becomes available as a subscription and or the price i will switch back to it i tried zico and found it to be a bit sour and bitter for my taste i am using roland cans now it is not as healthy as it has sugar and water added but i love the coconut bits and the taste is good and the price is right ,sweet and natural tasting , not as good as it is
for everybody information o n e coconut water is made in the not brazil as claimed it was only a brazilian who developed the business but the coconuts came from the a href http www amazon com gp product b ll r i vita coco pure coconut water ounce containers pack of a ,o n e coconut , great product
due to a failure in the packing of this item it was returned before even getting here i strongly recommend that the packing department does a better job because i ordered it again and this time one of the boxes was damaged apart from all that the product is great ,never got it , not as good as it is
i bought these for my vegan father who loves the curry kale chips by my month old daughter husband and i also like them br br thought i would give him a new kale chip flavor bbq as part of his christmas gift although a different brand than we typically eat they sounded good first i was disappointed to see these chips are not kale in its natural form but pressed into round dog snack looking discs luckily i tried them before giving them i spit it right out was it just me my husband also tried one and could not finish even one chip br br i have a pack of that cannot be returned what a waste of food and money ,horrible tasting chip , great chips
of the minute heating period you can avoid the spilling and ect also the noodles do at the bottom once you complete the soup but i usually keep a spoon nearby so i can at least finish the soup and not waste it simple fact of i guess but even frequently cannot seem to prevent this from br br despite these problems i give this product stars i do this because it is more a convenience than a with lower sodium than the regular type of soup this product is still mg of sodium of the recommended daily value and an easy to go container make it a good to go snack comparing the price per each on amazon vs a local store finds it much cheaper here on amazon i recommend this product but ask you head my suggestions to avoid the problems that appear to affect others too ,i still like it the problems , not as good as i be
these are good and low calorie i keep them in my office for when i want a light lunch i do not noticed that they are low sodium but i do not eat a lot of sodium anyway so it may taste different to someone else ,taste good low , good
every time i heated this particular soup in any microwave the container made a popping sound and popped up off the turning tray fell over and spilled out if you can catch it before it over completely you will find when eating that the noodles all to the bottom and you are left with a very pasty noodle at the end of the serving ,at the of , great product
it is too bad that i cannot find this product locally any longer it was a favorite in our household now my source is amazon and i am just as happy with that as i was before it has a great flavor that is long lasting ,where are you fruit gum , great product
after trying different citrusy flavors of gum including orbit citrus mint orbit fresca orbit fabulous extra fruit island cooler trident tropical twist and stride always mandarin i have concluded that stride forever fruit takes the crown br br there is a real burst of flavor and natural tasting sweetness as you pop a piece in your mouth and although it does not last forever it definitely holds its own against each of the flavors mentioned above br br feel free to conduct your own taste test to find your own favorite but i suggest you take my suggestion to try stride forever fruit who knows you may realize that you will not even want to try any others ,forever fruit is my forever favorite , great taste
arrived very speedy and the gum has an excellent flavor this is a gum chewer gum ,very tasty gum , good
this is a good gum to chew if you are looking to switch from sugared to sugarless gum it is sweet and does not have a strong aspartame taste for being sugar free it does not last forever like the commercials and forever fruit name would lead you to believe but the flavor lasts longer than a lot of sugarless gums and it has a nice kick of flavor when you first bite in everyone in my family likes this flavor of stride br br don t this with the darker but similar colored packaging mandarin flavor ,good fruity gum , not as good as it is
like me you can still enjoy the delicate beauty of bonsai carefully preserved these are real bonsai preserved in they need no feeding watering or plant care merely cosmetic care for those of us who do not have the time patience or to plants these make a nice and they make nice gifts too preserved bonsai can reach into the hundreds of dollars this one is double reasonably priced and very attractive ,if you have a brown , good for you
came packed so as to not move around in the box br they spray foam around the base and let it cure in the box it creates a very stable br the trees are gorgeous br they look very close to the they show here br since they are hand made each will look slightly different but nothing that from their overall beauty br by the way bonsai boy does not manufacture these br they are out to in other parts of the country hence the wait of at least days to get your item s br they are truly works of art and i would recomend these to anyone who has a love of these trees but like me does not have a green thumb br the with bonsai boy is good and they to answer any question you have br did i mention how beautiful these are lol ,great little , not as good as i like
we have purchased two trees and both were gifts the first tree was thoroughly packaged with some type of foam insulation totally the tree impressive excellent condition the second tree came with no insulation but with a the tree to the bottom of the box a couple of small were broken off it is much better packaging with the foam insulation br br the gift was assumed by the to be artificial fake which in this case was not a good thing the gift tree was actually preserved it would create a much better packaging if the tree came with a stating the type live preserved or artificial br br love the trees they made excellent gifts ,packaging , not as good as it is
my wife and i ordered this product for her birthday we received it quickly but we did pay extra for the shipping but we were in a hurry the product we received was in perfect condition and absolutely beautiful i hardly ever write reviews but this one was worth the time i love bonsai trees and will definitely buy another one just like this for myself in the near future this is a product that can be for many years to come ,absolutely beautiful , good stuff
been looking for a nice preserved bonsai for a friend who can kill grass and this seemed like a great solution shipping took a little longer than i expected but i guess i am spoiled with prime packaging was interesting with the bowl into the box with spray foam definitely held the piece but i almost damaged it getting it loose be prepared to literally cut it out of its packaging a pain but br br the piece itself was fairly well done definitely not as good as the one in the but still a nice piece i will probably do some light trimming to give it a little more character before to my friend the bowl and stone are nicely matched and the of moss is a nice touch ,nice product with , not as good as it is
this makes for a great centerpiece on a dining room coffee table as well as a great conversation piece i have to convince friends that this is not a real live bonsai tree when they see it it is very which is to be expected considering that this is just a real tree that is been preserved br br my tree does not have the look of the picture and the are much more bushy wild but it still looks fantastic i could always trim it if i wanted to make it more but i like it how it is the moss is a nice touch and the look great and are in so they will not fall out br br overall i am very pleased with my purchase ,beautiful tree , great coffee
the stuff in the freezer and it tore and all over the place it was ridiculous like working with melting taffy i live in washington state and it was october so humidity was definitely not the problem my last batch of white was but also than usual so pieces kept sticking to the mat even with cornstarch or shortening so far both batches of black that i purchased were great and did not have these issues i have to agree with other reviewers here that the consistancy is lacking with this product if you get a good batch it is the best stuff out there but you have to cross your fingers and hope luck is with you i may give them one more shot since my first few orders of white were perfect but i will probably also make some fondant just in case they are not up to ,not as good as i thought , not as good as i like
i have worked with a couple different types of fondants wilton and satin ice i must say sorry wilton but you have terrible fondant terrible anyway is great its soft stays soft tasty easy to work with i always have a tub just i run out of my main fondant if your looking for a starter fondant is great enjoy ,great , great product
i thought this fondant was very easy to work with and it tasted great also the wedding cake i used this product for turned out awesome and the and and their guest loved their cake ,great , great product
this product worked well for small cakes it also tasted great for any cakes over inches it just would pull until their was a hole in it it is almost too soft a product ,only for small , great product
stick to my mat cookie and but it was a constant battle my major complaint with this fondant is that it does not harden i made decorations days in advance which i have done in the past using wilton fondant and they were not the morning i needed them they were so soft that even picking them up the shape i ended up having to place a high powered fan in front of them while i went to work for hours only to come home to semi dry decorations because i have a ton left over i am going to try and mix gum paste with it to see if that helps with the and time i do not recommend this product if you are trying to create flowers stars or any type of decoration that requires and time needless to say i will not be buying this product again ,tastes great but that is about it , not as good as i be
this fondant taste great and is easy to work with easy to roll out and takes very little to make it pliable to work with ,taste great , great taste
as always fondarific is awesome covers cakes wonderfully and it is so easy to use love it and will continue to use it forever ,is the best , great product
this is extremely better than wilton buy this and never use that nasty stuff again this is actually edible unlike products and is very easy to work with ,fantastic , not as good as it is
i have tried wilton fondant before which tasted horrible and was not that easy to work with fondarific fondant is amazing it takes color very nicely i use wilton gel colors and is very easy to work with it is a little hard when you take it out of the container but i just pop it in the microwave for seconds and it becomes soft enough for me to work with br this fondant tastes soooo good like candy delicious br i made a tier birthday cake using this stuff and i still have some fondant left over br my were and the first two were tall and the tier was tall i also used this for decorations br everyone at the party loved it ,yummy very tasty and easy to work with , great product
it is impossible to lay flat too thin and it would stretch and get holes i will say it did get some skin during application i was able to smooth it out using a tool and the final product looked fine perhaps i was a little bit i used to teach a wilton cake decorating class and have taught fondant decorating for many years but have not done a cake in the past years i just never remember the wilton brand which tastes horrible ever being this hard to work with br br the flavor was fine on it is own but as most fondants it is incredibly sweet incredibly despite the improved flavor people were still it off the cake and eating the cake and frosting br br in the end the cake looked wonderful and people were pleased but not sure i will be using this brand again ,i really wanted to like this , not as good as it is
i usually make my own fondant but decided to give this one a try it was an absolute pleasure working with fondarific wedding white since its cold here at the moment the fondant arrived stone hard so i had to break some apart with a knife and heat in the microwave for ten seconds after which it was great working with it im not a and i have to say that this fondant was very easy to roll out and cover a two cake ,fantastic , great product
i purchased this fondant for a wedding cake that i was making i have tried numerous brands and even made my own fondant this fondarific fondant is easy to work with i am an baker and will purchase this product again ,best , great product
dry out which is lovely for covering cakes but is the reason is impossible br br this last time i ordered a five pound bucket in wedding white it was horrible it was so soft it was almost gooey i had my at degrees placed it in the freezer for awhile and it was still and soft as if i had been it forever i even added some and a ton of to try to it a little to no avail br br i was in a and had no time to get or make more fondant so my cake took times as long as it would have and it looked horrible i was very disappointed br br i guess i just got a bad batch this time i would suggest that you order ahead of time and check it first so you do not get stuck like i did ,a good product but quality is not , not as good as i like
i used this fondant to create dice to add to cupcakes for a for the cure they came out awesome and were a huge hit the fondant color was bright white and worked great with the wilton food for the dots on the dice this fondant is so incredibly easy to work with and it tasted delicious even the non fondant lovers in the crowd including me loved the taste i look forward to using this product again and again and again ,easy , great product
this was my first time using fondarific and fondant in general this one was really easy to use for a baby shower cake it worked just as indicated i also colored it and made a two tier cake baby blue and white the final product looked great not greasy ,easy to use , great product
with them br br the product was rock hard so i followed the enclosed instructions and heated it even less than the recommended time in the microwave it easily enough and smelled tasted good when it came to rolling i could tell immediately that this was going to be a challenge sure enough it tore all over the place i used cornstarch the way i was taught and it still stuck to every surface as if it were too warm or wet yet cracked as if it were too dry nothing made it so i lowered my standards and it anyway the two trip from the rolling surface to the cake it ripped in several places and the application to the cake ended in absolute no i did not roll it too thin yes i used cornstarch even though the packaging specifically claims it is unnecessary it sucks the end ,this is the first review i have ever , good product
i was very dissapointed with this fondant i decided to try it for the first time and that was a mistake they claim that the fondant can be rolled out thinner then most brands so you can use less to decorate more that is not true even just rolling it out to in it tends to tear once i finally got it on the cake to cover it is very hard to smooth it around the cake it is very sticky the fondant smoother does not smoothly over it all in all i will never buy this brand again i am going to stick with wilton ,very , not as good as it is
fondarific usually has glowing reviews everyone on the cake seems to love it my batch was either old or just crap very disappointing will go back to making marshmallow fondant cheaper and way easier to work with also bought the black but did not open it because the white was such crap had to use it because i ran out of time to make for the cake i was making due to the fact that i pre purchased fondant to use br br i love working with fondant and thought that maybe i would use something easier this time but it t good luck with this br br taste however was quite good ,old batch , not as good as it is
my fondarific wedding white fondant pounds is as hard as i just received this today i cannot use it obviously i have a wedding on saturday what should i do help this a non return item what should a customer do ,hard as is this how it should be i do not think so , the best
when i first heard of kopi luwak coffee i was but then the idea grew on me and i decided i really wanted to try it so on my bucket list it went to purchase this same package directly from the producer is nearly twice the price there is not really servings per package maybe half that it is pretty amazing coffee and i am thrilled i tried it remember when shopping for kopi coffe make sure you are getting coffee and not a blend which can have as little at or kopi luwak coffee check out com for info on how coffee is produced and how to brew the perfect cup ,off my , not as good as i have
after doing a ton of research and reading about coffee i finally broke down and purchased this for my birthday just to give it a shot at first i was not impressed thinking that i just for some upgraded folgers but then i figured it out the secret to this coffee is making it in smaller batches at first i was making cups at a time in my small coffee pot then i cut that back to a two cup using approx tablespoons of freshly ground coffee it was amazing the depth and natural sweetness of this coffee were unbelievable definitely something worth trying at least once i for one will be looking forward to the next time i can justify purchasing this special occasion coffee ,another item off the , great coffee
i thought that i should post a review in response to bad cat we ordered off the same batch for the same holiday reasons and had no effects the coffee was great there was no tart aftertaste no matter how strong you brew it the only reason that i gave it only four stars is that i would personally of liked a litter darker roast i just wanted to say that we drank off the same lot as bad cat in the same year christmas eve and christmas with zero headaches or ill it just might have been something else ,no problems from same batch , not as good as it is
in a relatively cheap manner it is not as good as some of the stuff i have had but it is definitely in that special class that kopi luwak in i have served this for guest given it as gifts and enjoyed it on special occasions i have made it in french press drip and in one special instance espresso br br to truly enjoy it use about grams of beans per ounces of hot water used to brew this is the appropriate serve black no cream or sugar as this will ruin your treat this bean is not for everyone but do not worry it is not an acquired taste its just a different taste br br product arrived fast thank to prime fresh as i wanted and the beans tasted just like they do when i buy them locally from bakery here in tx same beans same company ,good beans ok price , not as good as i be
i was excited to see that amazon is selling kopi luwak however these beans were a huge disappointment because they had no aroma and flavor at all i am guessing that they sent stale beans because there was no roast date printed on the bag ,stale beans , not as good as it
i bought this to take a check mark off of the bucket list but my wife and i had a cup of this and both of us immediately got sick with a headache and vomiting what made it worse it is christmas and this day is shot now we are coming through it but i am sorry to say but my bucket list was almost over before it got started try if you want but it is made us sick and almost in the hospital this is a christmas i would like to forget ,bad cat beans , not as good as it is
i wanted to try this coffee once in my life i was very happy with the company that mailed it and the timely manner in which they sent it ,coffee , great coffee
i was thrilled to find a source for smoked paprika this product is the real thing wonderful smokey flavor also speedy service i will be using this website for all my gourmet spices ,great service great product , great product
i live in a small city in and it is very hard to find certain products i was so pleased to see this product i watch so many programs on the food being one i wanted this product to make their rub when it arrived quickly i may add you could smell the powerful scent through the package it was wonderful strong aroma color and flavor this is the perfect product in a perfect size i once found a small bottle in a specialty store and paid almost dollars for oz i m not sure how many ounces is in this inch bottle but it is way more than oz i also got a great deal on the shipping i paid for the first item and the rest was shipped free can t beat that i love this product ,great product , great product
there was no seal of any kind on jar cap had slightly and some of the paprika had spilled out would not chance using an open jar so in the trash it went ,jar not , not as good as it is
wonderful seasoning for the barbecue rub on chicken meats etc smoky paprika really enhances the flavour of the slow roasted also gives it a very appetizing appearance br br fast shipping good price well sealed no problems would buy again br br q do you know the origin of the word barbecue br br a this word from the cooking methods of the who ate most of their meals cooked on an open grill hence barbecue ,superb great for the do you know the of the , great product
this gives a good flaver to bar b q even if done in the oven it can be used to give a smokey flaver to food not done on a outside cooker ,good product for bar b , great product
wow smoked sweet paprika is extremely hard to find in stores i was able to find this huge container of smoked paprika for a really good price i found that it was a really good spice to use and it makes food taste as if you grilled it on a charcoal grill which is awesome give it a shot you might like it ,flavor , the best
the paprika is good and the container will keep it fresh for some time i use these bulk spices to make my own rubs the container is also recyclable for keeping the finished rubs ,handy , great product
i have been trying to find a good paprika for a rub used in the smoker this stuff is the absolute best that i have found it is sweet but still has all the flavor you want from paprika without being overly smoky if you make homemade rubs i strongly recommend this stuff ,bbq , best ever
this is the smaller jar some what clumped could benefit from anti agents however i wanted this for canning so it works well defiantly worth the price contains chili pepper garlic coriander cumin all smoked ,could from , not as good as it is
i ordered smoke paprika unfortunately i received regular sweet i called and spoke with a gentleman who promised to send me the smoke paprika and for the mistake made until today month maybe later still have not received anything or heard from the company very disappointed ,very disappointed , not as good as it is
have not used it yet but if going by past creek products should be good ,big jar , not as good as
the details say br product features br pez packs br pez candy refills in each pack br pez assortment br br product description br pez lightning and doc each is individually bagged and include two great tasting candy refills br br i only got packs and only got of the also the picture showed packages obviously they put a in the title i thought that to be a misprint and took a pack and busted it down and sent me half for the price that was for rip off ,off , not as good as the
this is one of the best mixed nut blends i have ever had br everything tastes extremely fresh and natural the flavor combination is amazing perfect mix of nuts and dried fruits i really like that this blend does not include peanuts i am tired of nut blends always including peanuts enough already this was a refreshing change and a great snack br i also feel the price is reasonable considering there are no peanuts everything is natural and it tastes great ,delicious , best ever
the blend of ingredients is great and a good balance of dried fruit and nuts that our family enjoys i was having trouble finding it in the local stores that i shop so i thought i would shop for this online i was happy to find it but unhappy about how much more it costs to order online than picking it up at a local store i do not think i will order it again online and will simply keep my eyes open when i shop locally ,great product but expensive , great coffee
i tried a small cup of sample at my local bj store and just loved it then i picked up pack from the table right away even forgot to check the price anyway i will go back and see if the price is better at bj or at amazon ,totally agree with the other this is so great , great product
i found just enough of this product to be totally addicted now i cannot find it anywhere how come br it was the perfect blend to add to my morning hot cereal please bring it back br i agree that it was good in part because of no peanuts ,my favorite , great taste
i used this in a gift basket for a ladies tea i like the product myself very nicely packaged thank you ,product , great tea
i was quite excited to try this product so i bought packs we opened one and i tested a half tablet no result my wife tried the other half the next day we tried a full tablet letting it completely dissolve over the entire tongue i found the tablets pretty tasty themselves while my wife found them too chalky to enjoy anyway again there was no effect with lemons chili sauce etc our daughter also had no discernible change in her taste of foods br br happily for me the company is going to refund me for the other three packages but i would have preferred that they would worked i was looking forward to bringing them out at an upcoming party ,no on in our family , best popcorn ever
i guess everyone taste buds are different this product did not work for me every food item tasted as it should ,did not work for me , great taste
dissolved an entire tab on my tongue and was disappointed to discover that it had no effect on any of the foods that i tried ,does not work for me , not as good as it is
after taking a tab i was able to eat a hot pepper but it did not really taste sweet or good at all just not very hot then i tried some cayenne pepper which remained hot with no in taste this is a nice idea but did not work for me ,did not taste good for me , not as good as it is
i bought my mberry pack from mberry us online hoping to use it to curb my sweet tooth i followed the directions to the letter allowing the tablet to dissolve completely on my tongue i then tried vinegar nothing happened to the taste at all except that my tongue burned a little so i tried hot sauce nothing happened again except that my tongue burned a lot then i tried regular vinegar nothing happened again i even tried taking a second tablet but it still did nothing but slightly burn my tongue huge waste of money super disappointing does not work ,did not work for me at all , not as good as it is
not much to say other than the product is all hype i carefully followed the directions on the packaging of the mberry miracle fruit tablets and the results were about as as one of those potato chips the face of mary sorry of this is one that will not make the tonight show ,on the save some , great chips
br br after two weeks of waiting i received a notification that my order was being cancelled for some as yet to be determined problem the email attempted to spread the blame between amazon its supplier and some unknown factor ultimately taking no real responsibility for the br br color me frustrated and confused because while they said they are stopping all orders for the time being their company website still shows the product in stock and ready for orders br br this to say the least was very disappointing and more so because the company response was very and lame in my experience when a company up mind you it was not just my order it was a whole of orders that got cancelled br they should own up and take responsibility showing some integrity rather than some jumbo that does nothing to explain nor solve the customers problem ,of order after order was , not as good as i be
i am jealous of whoever thought of this but the actual product turns out to be pretty it turns out if you eat half a fruit roll up then eat asparagus the tastes differently than you might expect there that is all you need to know do not buy this product just buy some next time you are at wal mart star review because i like ,a vitamin , not as good as it is
i dissolved an entire tab in my mouth and then ate bitter greens and it did nothing i added some vinegar to the greens and it did make it a tad sweeter but it didnt make them taste good it makes really sour things slightly sweeter but no miracle ,did to nothing like it says it will , not as good as it is
it did not work for me maybe its because i could not get past letting the whole tablet dissolve because to me the tablet tasted like vomit ,did not work for me , not as good as
which i guess is good the sweet taste was just different br i also ate cottage cheese it tasted like cottage cheese with sweetener in it br the product works immediately by the way no waiting for this to work br br i think this product will last me a while br the day after this review i took a tiny nibble of the leftover tablet i made another glass of lemon water and the lemonade was perfect for me not overly sweet tasted like a lemon drop p br your may vary with this product br br i ve heard that other brands taste a bit better than this one br i just ordered a pack from another company i will report back br br i have a huge sweet tooth and i am trying to lose some weight i am hoping these tablets will help me with that ,it works , not as good as it is
one person is super sweet to another so be warned results for these may vary br br i found that the tablets did not make things sweet as much it cut down on the sourness almost like a effect ever put sugar on a lemon slice and bit into it the sour kick is still there just canceled out i am certainly not going to be eating them like candy as some reviews suggest br br tried out a few beer types with mixed results beers that are fruity citrus ended up gross as it would taste like i mixed in a mouthful of juice with the beer dark beers like an irish red were my favorite br br i really recommend going out to eat so you can try a variety of things certain foods will take you for surprise ranch dressing for example was different and very good ,but not , not as good as it is
i do reccomend this product as it is effective and very fun to try here are the it only lasts around minutes not hours i bought these in lieu of the actual berries vs so they were not as potent as i had read about expected nonetheless they do work lemons and limes were delicious br oh be sure to move the tablet over the entire surface of your in order to cover all of your taste buds ,it works , not as good as it is
basically these tables change the way you taste acidic things they will instead taste sweet lemons taste like a strong lemonade some of you might be thinking well that is fun and all but how would my lover taste well kind of sweet men and women give it a try you will see my only complaint is that they made them look so much like a drug that i had to convince some of my more friends that it was just ground fruit ,i know what your and yes it works for that too , not as good as it is
absolutely hate beer sour candy and some red i let the pill dissolve on my tongue and started out trying a lemon one thing i recommend which i did not do was to try out all the food first to get something to compare it to i sat in front of my boyfriend and ate a whole lemon without even then i told him to try it and he could barely lick it without making a face then i tried some beer it tasted like cold coffee with a hint of i eventually got him to take one of the pills we had sooo much fun tasting foods it was amazing how much it worked i already recommended it to all my friends and now i recommend it to you it can be a really cool party trick by someone you can eat a whole lemon without making a face ,it works and was fun , the best licorice ever
whole lime but was worried all that acid might upset my stomach i did not notice any difference when i ate parsley though the parsley still tasted somewhat bitter to me miracle berry worked extremely well for me with sour stuff but not at all as far as i could tell with bitter stuff br br still well worth the price to experience this amazing in taste br br edit i had a craving for blackberries and bought a large container of them from a warehouse type store i planned on eating them all at one sitting but after one or two i could not eat them they were mostly sour and hardly any sweet i remembered that i had some of these tablets left so i rolled one around on my tongue until it dissolved and the blackberries tasted pleasantly sweet so i was able to finish them all ,amazing , not as good as i like
to taste the results i have used this brand several times and it seems to be pretty consistent in it is effectiveness and quality the best way i can describe the effect of these tabs is it makes a lemon taste like a lemon shake up from a fair it does not create a super candy like sweetness which i think would be really weird anyway there is still a hint of sour behind the sweet taste also they do not last anywhere near an hour more like min so just be warned and be ready to taste things immediately after dissolving the pill in your mouth in my experience there have been a percentage of people for whom the tabs are not effective maybe between in a group people per the tabs are somewhat expensive but as a pretty unique experience i definitely recommend trying it at least once ,m , not bad but not as good as it is
i just did a test run for a work party and i sampled raspberries strawberries lemons limes tabasco sauce goats cheese beer orange juice and yogurt first off the lemon was the best tasting example of fruit i have ever had in my life i wanted to eat the whole thing the rest of the fruits tasted delicious the unsweetened yogurt was good the orange juice amazing and the beer much sweeter the goats cheese didnt taste that yummy to me and the tabasco sauce didnt have a noticeable change in flavor over all a very fun and effective flavor changing experience ,amazing , great taste
it does change the way you taste but not to such a great effect that you are expecting it is more of a pleasant surprise and not a omg surprise it makes sour and most fruits sweeter it makes beer taste like some sort of sugary juice and i do not like beer i would like to try cream cheese and wine which are supposed to be yummy i recommend this product and i only need a half a tablet to last about min to an hour i would not dare try spicy foods as they suggest on the package but they suggest pineapple cheese peppers and limes lemon in water tasted like lemonade with tons of sugar i would and see how it works out for you it does not work on all foods though like potatoes or meats as it mostly your sour or tart taste buds ,it does change the way you taste , not as good as it is
my daughter had me buy these for her th birthday party what a success the tablets arrived ahead of schedule so we could concentrate on other items the kids had a fun time trying out sour foods that became sweet after letting the tablets melt in their mouth everyone had a great time and really enjoyed them we are recommending them to everyone ,miracle fruit , not as good as it is
great for parties this stuff actually works i was eating heads which i normally hate like they were gummy bears eating a lemon tasted like drinking lemonade you have got to try this stuff ,wow , great taste
i purchased these tabs for my daughters flavor tripping party i have never tried them out before so i invited a couple of friends over to experience this with me i set up a spread our items gave everyone a mberry and got to tasting the first item that we tried was a lemon and we were literally blown away because they were so sweet and tasty next came the dill pickle and it tasted like a sweet pickle we even tried ketchup and mustard and could not stop dipping out fingers in it because the flavors were unbelievable we also had a bottle of cheap dry wine and it was delicious the strawberries were so delicious that we ate the entire bowl fruit were great too this is something that i know my daughter will enjoy at her party and i will be trying these time and time again ,away , not as good as i be
family i have found that the biggest hits tend to be vinegar and tart citrus like lemons limes or grapefruit juice for me all go from being sour to very sweet yes to the point where if i did not know better i would be gulping the vinegar down dark beers are interesting with the changed flavor still usually somewhat enjoyable foods or drinks that are already very sweet become and unpleasant it is still worth trying just to see the effect but keep that in mind when choosing things to try with the tablets in advance br br i ve ordered these times and hope to do so again at the time of this writing they are not available if they remain out of stock for too long i will have to try some of the alternatives i am reluctant to do so though knowing how effective these are ,flavor is fun , not bad but not as good as it is
things to try i think next we are going to have a big group over to play around as other reviewers have mentioned you can split the tablets in half to the effect remember if you are going to have a flavor tripping party of your own pack some after all we ate we really needed it br br i gave mberry pills to friends for the holidays the pills did not work for all of them judging by some of the reviews the pills either do not work for everyone or not every pill is the same i contacted the seller who put me in touch with the manufacturer and they are sending me out a replacement batch to give the people who had a bad experience excellent customer service all around i still recommend giving the tablets a try if it works for you it is really amazing ,so much fun but do not the , i love it
referred me to these and told me that they were awesome i decided to give them ago and surprisingly they work extremely well i found that the taste of them while they are dissolving on your tongue is a bit horrid but nothing i could not tolerate br br after it dissolved me and some friends decided to test it we cut up some lemons and limes and decided to see if these really worked and to our amazement they really did the lemons tasted like a lemon drop candy and the limes were very refreshing we then our and started trying other things to see what it was like we found some other foods to be excellent and others not so much all in all it is very fun br br they are however quite expensive the effects on me lasted roughly hours so as a novelty for these ,miracle berry fruit , not bad but not as good as it is
this is a neat product and it does what it says it does however if you decide to have a party where you guests to partake of handfuls of raw cranberries lemons juice tabasco sauce beer mustard and a variety of other items which are sour the miracle berry can do nothing at all to the considerable effect this will have on their ,it works but watch out , not as good as it is
i ordered these after hearing about them from some friends i was very skeptical if it would even really work noticeably and was even more skeptical about the pill form but wow they really do work it makes anything bitter or sour taste instantly sweet i tried a few things and could definitely tell they were sweeter but the most noticeable was the lemon i really did not even want to try it at first but i was told i had to it tasted like the sweetest and most flavorful lemonade ever seriously it was like candy all of the sudden i almost could not believe it when a few friends were over i gave them a pill each and we all of the sudden lemons were the best thing ever lol ,very cool , not as good as it is
i purchased this for my mother who is currently some powerful during her first she hated everything because everything tasted like metal and it was short of teeth to get her to eat something she called me and asked me to order her this because an nurse that she is friends with suggested it during her second she ate all her normal foods and actually enjoyed it making the entire process of eating during a small miracle we were so happy that she was eating because of this that we ordered more immediately ,miracle , great product
effects with some foods are more remarkable than others i found balsamic vinegar tasting fairly like wine to be one of the most remarkable ,fun , not as good as
i got these tablets to try them out to see if they really worked and to my suprise they do and they made lemons taste amazing most of the other items on the list did not taste much better to me but i am still trying some out ,are amazing , not as good as it is
i just mentioned and had a bite too sweet for me next up some fermented spicy ever hear of dave gourmet korean food everything is fermented in vinegar and it is delicious the vinegar taste was gone but the spiciness remained interesting i actually like the regular flavor so i will not be having that again oh i also tried chocolate flavored coconut water yuck there was a chocolate chalky taste to it it has now been minutes and i just tried the other half of the lemon it still tastes sweet to me and then i had a sip of veggie broth from dave korean which is the only thing that has changed in a way that was pleasing to my taste buds br br i m giving the mberry four stars because it does do what it claims it is just not my preferred way of tasting things ,too sweet for my tastes , not bad but not as good as it is
make sure you a lot and do not swallow for best results they will typically last a few hours they are a big hit for guests you can even get by with half after you have had one or two does not work too well on but most sour and acidic foods there is a very noticeable effect ,just as advertised , not as good as it is
chewed a few of these and ate cheese hot sauce and a bunch of citrus pretty neat stuff if it was less expensive i could see this those who d like to cut down on their sugar but still enjoy fruits ,stuff , best chocolate ever
it works that is what matters people have to pick every little thing maybe it does not last forever but it is not meant to br br my experience melted it on my tongue and ate some foods i could not normally eat this means it worked and real good highly recommended strawberries willing to buy these again just for eating strawberries limes are tasty too ,people are so picky , great for
i took these over to a friends house and tried them with amazing results after sucking on the pill and letting it dissolve for a few minutes it really did make everything sour taste sweet we tried lemons limes even sour candy the weird thing is they did not affect the taste of sweet things like oranges these are great for a dinner party ,very unique , not as good as it is
before i bought this product i read several reviews saying that this stuff was amazing that it made everything super sweet so i thought i would try it out and it is pretty cool but not worth the outrageous price about one minute after i sucked the tab i tried eating numerous things like limes lemons and oranges just to name a few it did make everything that is sour sweet not to the point of oh my god it is amazing but it did work so to sum this up this stuff was good for a one time deal but after doing it a few times it lost it is appeal ,it is cool but no miracle , not as good as it is
the tablets do work but from i read in the description that half a tablet would work it does but you have to make sure your whole tongue and mouth had decent contact with the tablet piece the tablet dissolves quite fast in your mouth so tablet may be too little br br i tried again using tablet and had good results then tried with and had slightly better results the effect was pretty good lemons are still a bit sour to eat raw but its not that bad grapefruit is particularly awesome with this tablet limes were in between still a little sour but tasted quite nice overall i could still not eat too much lemon or lime and the acid content of both got me worried about too much ,works well , not as good as it is
this is a great product i gave a few tablets away to family and friends and they all loved it it made anything with citric acid sweet and even made some fruits sweeter its a real experience for the ,miracle , great taste
this tablets were really fun to try out my parents my and my friends all loved them and were so confused on how well they worked do not drink store bought orange juice though it was sickly sweet because of the sugar added and the acid in it my favorite was fresh pineapple and sucking on limes limes were sweeter for me than the lemons ,flavor , great product
were just picked off the plant tree at the height of it was like being a kid again and biting into my first br br i did not notice any change at all with anything bitter beers and coffees and teas tasted about the same spicy things like hot sauce tasted kind of gross savory things like noodles and meat got a slight hint of sweetness but nothing that noticeable sweet things like candy and cake were made to be way too sweet to be palatable br br definitely make sure you get the tablet to slide all over your tongue and do not chew leave it on your tongue until it dissolves br br if you are a fan of sweet succulent fruit but cannot get fresh produce from markets do yourself a favor and try these it is worth the price for the fun at the very least ,awesome , not bad but not bad
first things first these actually work i tried tons of different foods and they all tasted a lot better if you have not tried these already it is a must it is definitely a great experience ,these are awesome , great taste
heard about these and simply had to check them out ordered a package and invited a few friends over after a huge shopping trip for an evening of flavor tripping that is exactly what it was the tablets have an odd taste not the best but for two hours everything we ate was completely different from anything i have had before lemons kiwi strawberries cheese mustard cranberry juice oj and a lot more it all was completely different and was like experiencing these foods for the first time everything was sweet and tasted with few much better i ended up eating whole lemons by the end because they were my favorite br br these really are amazing and i would recommend them to anyone who likes food ,made for one interesting , not as good as i be
had fun with my family with the they absolutely worked for all of us and it was a blast definitely worth a try ,really works , great product
it really did help my father is a cancer patient and didnt want to eat because the taste was no good well the miracle berry gave him a good taste again ,it really did help , not as good as
with slight concerns that it will not work all those concerns went away when i tried it it was a tingly feeling at first where ever it was on the tongue i did not notice anything first thing i tried was a grape i mean this was the most delicious grape i had ever tasted i started try all the fruits and sodas i could amazing people do not realize that you should use it on fruits and things with acidity it is supposed to make them sweeter although it did make one of my cookies sweeter it was not nearly as dramatic as when i ate a lime it tasted like lime i would not suggest eating a bunch of lemons because this only affects your tongue not your stomach when you buy these you run the risk that it will not work but it probably will very pleased ,amazing , not as good as it is
fun to try really they are just an amazing way to eat lemons you can basically lemons in water and it tastes delicious br br i cannot tell the difference between brands seem pretty much the same to me br br they make a fun gift do not buy them for a mind experience they are not drugs they are a sort of food sweetener ,fun to try , not as good as it is
the effect was just as described and worked for about minutes i would recommend trying it if you are interested you will not be disappointed ,worked as expected , not as good as
fun changes taste of so many things try it we almost drank a whole bottle of lemon juice after using this fruit that is how well it works ,fun , not as good as it
i really enjoyed this tried it with my family and my dad was so skeptical at first but when he took a bit into the lemon he was the look on his face was best for of friends unless you experiment alone but the more the wish it came with more berries per the price which is a bit steep for tablets and not the real berries which are hard to come by people said it lasts only a couple minutes but for me it was a decent minutes or more obviously the lemons with juice and other fruits will make it end quicker since there are liquids washing it out just have everything prepared and on the table before you take it ,m definitely works and is a of fun , not as good as it is
i was researching the miracle berry protein for a research so i decided to give these tablets a try the effect was immediate and lasted approximately min for me and my coworkers everyone was completely in love with the lemons and those who normally enjoy the flavor of lime went nuts over them as well for some the effect was actually too sweet and they gave up after a few foods other foods beverages tested were blackberries and raspberries lost their tartness red wine vinegar sweet on the tongue but not so great in the throat and loses bitterness and is sweet if you squeeze some lime into it it certainly is not cost effective as a diet aid but it is a great trick to share when you are entertaining ,miracle berry , not as good as it is
it works and lasts for a few minutes to make sweet its ,taste , great product
for a real tast treat you have to try these sour foods taste sugary sweet apples strawberries and oranges will taste like the most delicious fruit you have ever had this makes for a fun party activity where guests will over the wonderful vinegar and candy like limes ,it is , great taste
maybe the miracle fruit does not work for everyone it had very little effect when i used it i started with a clear let the pill dissolve on my tongue etc then i tried the classic first a lime i noticed barely that it was not quite as as it may have been without the mberry but just slightly and it did not add any sweet it just a hint of sour other foods like vinegar vinegar chips strawberries cheese etc many recommended fruits and foods have very little impact and after just a few minutes i could notice any change br br so either some people just do not have the same level of effect or much of the miracle berry effects are group dynamics and either way they were a let down ,very , not as good as it is
these tablets did work but were not nearly as effective as i had expected i set up an entire spread of foods cheeses fruits vegetables liquids etc to try and when my friends and i allowed the tablets to dissolve they only worked on a couple things and only for a very short period of time maybe min ,fun but not as effective , not as good as it is
cut through the sour ness turning it super sweet br br oranges were okay just tasted a little sweeter than normal the lemons were still a bit sour but i found myself eating slices of them which i do not think i could have done without the tablets i swear the red grapefruit was by far the best in my opinion br br we found that the more sour a food the more drastic an effect i definitely recommend trying these tablets with a full fridge so you can experience all types of foods i would say some grapefruit lemons and dill pickles are a must to try with these br br they re great to try with friends as the novelty wears off after one or two tries as long as there are new people around though it is fun to see other reactions to the tablets definitely recommend ,pretty fun , not as good as i be
i took one of these tablets and the results were i drank some pure lemon juice and it tasted like very sweet lemonade my sister then tried it and it out immediately i then tried a lime which was delicious and some cheese i do not usually like cheese but i after eating a little bit i was amazed at how wonderful it tasted with the tablets i highly recommend this product it will you the moment you start tasting ,product , not as good as it is
at first i did not think they would work but i bought them after reading the scientific view of them and then decided to buy them just to see after i got them i had to try something sour just to see so i took a half tablet and put some lemon juice on my amazingly they worked this is an awesome product for anyone who likes things or just has a liking of chemistry ,they actually work , not as good as it is
these tablets hardly work in comparison with the actual berries if you want flavor tripping then buy a box of the berries or grow your own plant instead of wasting money on the pill tablets in my opinion ,miracle better , great product
i tried two lemons after dissolving two tablets in my mouth it tasted just like lemonade one thing the package recommends tablet that did not work for me if you are a tad overweight two is better ,it works as , not as good as it is
i seen this product on dr oz and i just had to try this out to see if it works yes it works and i can eat and drink lemon juice three times a day br it is a miracle pill ,miracle fruit , not as good as it is
i used the tablets and it made lime and lemon sweeter it was not as sweet as all the other reviews claimed the lemon tasted like a sort of ripe orange i let my grandma try it but she said it did not work for her ,works as advertised , not as good as it is
as other reviewers have pointed out the effects vary from person to person each tablet seemed to last up to a half hour longer for my sister and while it did make things noticeably sweeter the initial taste of something was identical and it slowly got sweeter after the first half a second oh and sour bitter drinks like monster took on a sickly sweet syrupy flavor that may leave you feeling a bit ill after do not try apple cider vinegar it tastes fine if a bit odd on your tongue but as soon as it hits your throat the flavor and were awful ,it works but not as expected , not as good as it is
they do make sour stuff sweet for a bit but sometimes it gives it an odd flavor great novelty item ,eh , not as good as it
i have had this a few times before and it is amazing last time i had it a half pill was one dose so i thought this was a bit cheaper than it turned out to be but it is still great and well worth it at per dose i like that it also came with some recommended foods to try lemons and limes are by far the best beer is pretty cool too ,miracle fruit rocks , best ever
the mberry tablets worked great we tried a lot of the suggested and most of them had some sort of fun taste after eating the tablets ,great get idea , great product
i was curious and decided to buy this product because of it and despite the price it worked and is seriously cool i followed the directions by putting a whole tablet on my tongue and letting it completely dissolved sliced up a lemon and very put it in my mouth just to find that it tasted like a sweet lemonade there was only a slight of sour i would have happily kept eating lemons as they were delicious the the acid on my lips told me to stop i plan on buying much more of this product in the future it works and is fantastic ,these are cool , not as good as it is
it was crazy it made things taste super sweet some things not at all though however this was extremely reliable and i my package a day early a first for me with amazon ,wow , not as good as it is
my friend brought this over for a party and we tried the limes lemons oranges and bananas the initial taste of the tablet is pretty nasty but just stick with it until it is dissolved completely on your tongue coating it after that sour fruit like lemons and limes taste like the best sour candy you have ever tasted in your life and you will devour them d ,amazing , not as good as it is
it does work but only for a short time you need to dissolve it on your tongue and then let the fun begin ,miracle fruit , good
this stuff works but be warned the effect does not last very long for some people but it is still amazing my friend and i tried eating a lemon slice and it was amazing until the effect started to wear off slightly in the middle of it ,awsome , great product
a very interesting and fun way to spend an evening the tablet itself has a somewhat tart flavor we sampled everything from cottage cheese to beers to fruits to salt and vinegar chips to some differences were astounding some not so much great little for your mouth ,fun little , great chips
just a tad expensive but than heck it really does what it says awesome ,miracle berry , great product
they were not mind but they were definitely fun so far i have tried mine with a beer and a few snack foods everything did taste noticeably sweet especially the beer it ended up tasting like a cream soda br br i m looking forward to some more experimenting ,fun different , not as good as
these tablets are quite odd but they do work they have a sort of chalky taste as you let them melt on your tongue but if you get past that the effect is amazing we ate whole lemons and limes oranges tasted like candy it lasts for quite awhile too they are definately worth a try ,these are weird , not as good as it is
this mberry product really worked for my friends and i unfortunately it only worked for about to minutes at most it still made for a really fun experience br the food items that were the most awesome included cream cheese tasted like cheesecake grapefruit tasted sweet without added sugar lemons tasted like they had grown from a lemonade tree and various assortments of beer just a different taste all together br definitely worth the bucks if you are a foodie and want to experience this food trend ,totally works but for a amount of time , not as good as it is
asian market that is what it tastes like for those who do not know do not worry it is nothing disgusting kinda bland to be honest after is dissolved the first thing i tried was a lime verdict sweet not overly sweet but still sweet kind of like a lemonade just a tad of sugar missing next up apple cider vinegar sweet does not taste exactly like apple cider like some people say but i see what they are saying last test is cheese it tasted different but not exactly a big change br br as for how long it lasted i would say after minutes it started to fade after an hour it was gone br br bottom line it was fun to try it out and i will definitely be trying out more things in the future as for a flavor tripping party maybe a good business venture ,miracle no fun absolutely , not bad but not as good as it is
this is my first time with the miracle berries in general we got a bunch of friends over and everyone brought something oranges taste like the orange slice candies and lemons taste like lemon drops my favorite is the christmas beers that are available this time of year they were almost like apple cider everyone had fun everything arrived fast great seller stars ,amazingly fun , not as good as it is
these tablets definitely made things sweeter like lemons limes and grapefruit but it was not to the point of amazement they also had an interesting effect on cheeses and vinegar but still did virtually nothing for beer and wine the tablets are a bit pricey but they do work if you have got extra money sure give them a try but if you are looking for some amazing way to get your kids to eat broccoli or something along those lines then this is not the answer fun experiment but not life changing ,pretty cool but not life , not as good as it is
i have tried this with multiple foods at different times and with anywhere between one and three tablets all held on different areas of the tongue while i could swear there were minor changes at low quantities this did not change no matter how many were tried i am sure that the miracle berries are authentic but my friend and i did not experience anything as incredible as people say or even anything noteworthy i would go for the actual fruit next time ,disappointed , not as good as it is
it works i took one minutes later i was trying different things in my mouth last thing im trying right now is beer and it taste different and sweat if your into trying new things give these a try i read that it wont work on some people but well chalk this as a did work for me review ,interesting , not as good as it is
this tablet which is referred to as the miracle berry is used to taste of unpleasant to you items you can let dissolve in your mouth around once or twice then bite a lemon and it taste sweet it is an odd sort of sweet it comes with a list of items you can use it with lemons strawberries cheese i was using it to try and mask the taste of the salt water flush while doing the master it does not mask salt water not sure of a use i would have for it it does what it claims just not needed for me ,miracle berry as used on dr oz , not as good as it is
in reading the reviews here it is obvious that different tastebuds are affected very differently at first i the tablets did nothing even though i used a whole one bitter foods and drinks still tasted bitter to me sweet foods and drinks did not taste any sweeter i was prepared to write the whole thing off as effect on the part of some people but the positive reviews made me try again it was when i drank pure lemon juice that i noticed a difference pure lemon tasted like lemonade so the product does work it just may not work exactly as advertised for you ,works with a , not as good as it is
i tried the mberry and the effect lasted one hour for me i purchased this version since it had excellent reviews and was a slightly higher price br br this version lasted only ten minutes i tried tablets out of three different packages from three different batches to make sure it was not a faulty batch the results from each test was the same br br i would not suggest this version of the product other tablet versions may be more effective but would suggest actual berries ,not as effective as , not as good as it is
quite disappointed the pills do not last that long it wears off after a few tries per pill and not all the food items on the suggested list works e g cheese maybe it was a bad batch but i am not taking the risk to purchase it again ,not satisfied , not as good as it is
i tasted about half of the different foods on the big list of recommendations most tasted slightly different some got a sweet in the mouth i got the strongest effects from vinegar ketchup mustard and salt vinegar chips but nothing tasted better as i had expected as others have pointed out everyone reacts differently the two other people i did it with seemed to have about my reaction as well one experienced a bit stronger and the other one a bit weaker than me you could try this if you are interested but i would not buy it again ,not , not as good as it is
worked very little sweetened fresh pineapple but changed the taste to a bit bitter br a sour orange it did help it did not work on anything else at all ,miracle berry , not as good as it is
this stuff really works makes lemons taste sweet gave to a friend she loved it and ordered to give to her friends great party idea try mberry with all sorts of foods will change their flavor fun to experiment ,really works , great taste
first of all these things taste pretty bad if you can handle the taste while they melt on your tongue maybe it would not be as bad but i really did not notice much change in the taste of foods lemons tasted sweet but that is all i noticed i considered trying two at a time but they just tasted so bad to me that i have never used them again ,nasty , not as good as it is
of us who took it three of us just felt sick after the process all of us concluded that while our taste buds were playing tricks on us they were not necessarily good tricks i would not say sour things tasted sweet for instance i would say they tasted weird kind of like but not very good ones the only thing i tried that really improved after dissolving the pill on my tongue was a light it tasted like a pretty good after the pill and everyone seemed to like this but sometimes a nice cold light is just what you need so if you have nothing left to spend your money on this is not the worst choice in the world but do not expect a miracle because that is not going to happen expect a stomach ache a loss of appetite and then you will not find disappointment ,not quite the miracle we were , not bad but not as good as it is
my husband and i were excited to try them we bought pineapple beer lemon lime hot peppers cheese and wine the only thing we noticed any difference in was the lemon and lime the lemon was pretty easy to eat because it added some sweetness it remained quite sour though we each let one tablet dissolve on our tongue as directed so not sure what the problem was ,not impressed , not as good as it is
i and a friend tried these tablets before sampling various kinds of foods we would seen suggested online but noticed no effects whatever we used them as suggested then even tried multiple tablets at once maybe i got a bad batch or maybe we have unusual taste buds but in any case it was very disappointing makes me think i should have tried the berries themselves instead ,i think , not as good as it is
after reading several glowing reviews about this product i decided to buy it and see for myself how great it is br br after following the instructions i taste tested a variety of items that were suggested on the packaging none of which seemed to have any affect on lemons i noticed a slight taste change however the lemon was no sweeter br br bottom line the product is over and in my opinion is not worth the buying i know it is definitely not something i will ever purchase again ,does nothing , not as good as it is
my friend br br after both of us trying the miracle berry tablets i would have to say that the product is extremely and the experience was unfortunately lacking br br the way mberry about their tablets you would expect to have a willy wonka esque food tasting sadly this is not the case and though the tablets do change the flavors of many foods to a degree it is much more subtle than you would probably like no here i found this to be the case for me and i was hoping maybe my taste buds were maybe just a bit more dull but my friend reported the same experience br br i m giving the product stars not because i hated the product but because i was very let down with the experience and taking that fact into consideration i do not think it is worth the money ,nothing here , not bad but not as good as it is
not worth the cost br br i have only had these as free samples br br i would pay for a pack of i may even be willing to pay for a pack of br anything more than is total robbery br br so obviously is way too much br br this product is super cool and i loved how it worked br br but really br br mberry should market their product as a food enhancer not as a flavor tripping experience br br if mberry does that and prices their products reasonably it will gain customers br br keeping there product around as a flavor tripping experience will surely make it a passing ,these do work and are cool but , not as good as it is
i bought these tablets to try during lunch at work four of us each tried one tablet tasted various foods and noticed no difference at that point i gave up but two friends went on to try four tablets each they reported strange flavors in some of the foods they tried but many items remained among those that were was a fruit punch reported to taste so sweet as to be very like drinking pure sugar and a cashew which apparently tasted like heaven most other affected foods were br br in all we were with these tablets while they did accomplish their flavor changing purpose it took a lot of tablets before any change was noticeable and the experience though fun was rather pricey considering how many tablets were required i was really hoping for a bigger impact ,works of , not as good as it is
the sweetest ones she would ever had br br however the real treat for both of us came with the lemons and limes both of which tasted noticeably better however the effect of a single tablet off completely within minutes to be honest i hoped each tablet would last closer to an hour but as is you are paying quite a bit per minute for these things we paid for ten tablets w shipping br br would i try it again after the tablets we have left are finished i think not i already enjoy apples bananas watermelon oranges and strawberries without this tablet i can live a perfectly happy life without ever eating grapefruit lemons or limes directly lemon and lime are fine in foods br br if you are dead set on trying these tablets try it with some of your friends but do not expect too much ,the is barely and definitely not worth more than once , not as good as i be
this stuff is in a can i swear its that good the vanilla flavor is perfect not too sweet to be artifical and not too malted to taste funky br its smooth and absolutely perfect around the holidays although we drink it year round like other fans i order it by the case for myself and my family at home i take a can or two to work and usually giving more away as parts of gift baskets and things like that its perfect paired with fresh baked cookies or alone with a good book when you want to up and feel relaxed br i dont drink coffee so im a of cocoa type drinks this stuff is amazing get some and you will see exactly what i mean ,amazing , good but not great
at my house we call it hot vanilla this is the best hot chocolate type drink i have ever tasted i am a chocoholic but now i order stephen french vanilla by the case because all the others pale in comparison and i just do not want them anymore you will not regret for a case of it makes a terrific gift too mmmmmmm ,heaven in a cup , not as good as it is
i read all the positive reviews and thought i would give it try first of all it tasted stale secondly i had to use spoonfuls just to get any taste and then it did not taste like the chocolate it tasted more like for the young people out there ovaltine was drink in the which i did not like any better we all have different tastes for my part i will not be ordering this again update i bought the milk chocolate at the same time and decided to try that it was delicious i cannot explain the difference but i would recommend the milk chocolate just stay away from the one with the marshmallows ,disappointed , not as good as it is
stephen hot chocolate is the best hot chocolate in the world i will not drink any other hot chocolate the french vanilla is my personal favorite ,the best hot chocolate in the world , great hot cocoa
this has a very dark chocolate flavor that mixes quickly and smoothly in hot water no like most of the other brands milk chocolate is fine for those who enjoy that but for real chocolate lovers that enjoy the true flavor of dark chocolate do not miss this ,best chocolate drink ever , great taste
i am a huge stephen fan but i would only ever had the regular milk choc hot cocoa deciding to be a little more health conscious i thought i would try the fat free variety don t okay if you are not expecting it to be like the regular version then go for it it is much better than other fat free hot cocoa varieties but does not do to regular stephen hot cocoa i am going back to the good stuff ,not if you have had the regular version okay , not as good as it is
i ordered this as the price was certainly right lb cans for less than and the reviews were good br br this is certainly a step up in the hot cocoa market better than just about anything you can find in the supermarket i certainly prefer hot chocolate but it can be time consuming to make and it is tough to heat milk and melt chocolate at work or in class br br this is the perfect compromise for when you want that chocolate drink and are not in a position to do it right br br very good taste and dissolves well i always use a little more than it says on the can with some cocoa that means it will not all dissolve this is not a problem here br br certainly recommended ,very good hot cocoa , very good hot cocoa
i purchased this product as a gift for my mom who simply loves this cocoa when the local supermarket where she purchased the cocoa stopped stocking it she figured that was the end of it ha little did she know that i would find a way to track it down on line and on amazon she was surprised and pleased the price is good as is the cocoa i would only be more happy if i could get an assortment ,yummy , great product
this is my family favorite hot cocoa brand the kids favorite flavor if mint chocolate ,the best hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
i ran into this product at a bed and breakfast unlike most hot chocolate mixes with another flavor component the raspberry flavor in this is an equal partner with the chocolate you do not get just a hint of it that soon gets lost you taste the raspberry with the first sip and the last sip very very enjoyable highly recommend ,hot chocolate with , great hot chocolate
this is absolutely delicious because it is in powder form you can make it as strong or weak as your taste buds allow i add instant folger to mine making it into a mocha that also cuts the sweetness it really does taste like chocolate covered cherries a treat i have loved since childhood br br i get mine through the subscription program along with several other flavors from stephen the subscription program works well for me since i travel you can change the frequency and the address to which it is to be sent as needed ,gourmet hot cocoa cherry chocolate ounce cans pack of , delicious
i was a little dissapointed it tastes good it is just a little watery tasting land of the is better but they dont have sugar free so for sugar free i can give a heads up on this product ,good not great , not as good as
i found the packets at walmart for cents i believe but when i went back a week later they did not have anymore i also checked and and they did not have it either i was so happy i found it on amazon and in cans which i think is a better deal than packets because you get more product this is definately the best hot chocolate i have ever had the peppermint is not over powering like most peppermint hot chocolates i have had i will definately be buying more when i run out ,amazing , great hot cocoa
i absolutely love this stuff my dad used to give us each a can or two for christmas every year and it was always a favorite i have never been able to find it where i live now i should of known to check amazon by the way i have never tasted a variety i did not like but i have never tried the reduced fat kind either i also like to make it with coffee instead of water when i need a little boost it almost makes coffee taste good sorry but there is nothing out there that can do that ,the best , good but not great
i like stephen s gourmet hot cocoa white chocolate mix because to me it taste like white chocolate the taste is almost identical if it had a little vanilla it would be a copy cat this cocoa to me has alot of class unlike the others this stephens white chocolate mix has alot of class i just have to say stephen i really enjoy sipping white hot cocoa again a friend told me how delicious this cocoa was i never imagined how delicious i am so glad i purchased it stephen a customer for life ,it has a far taste , not as good as it is
i purchased this for my girlfriend who loved this stuff over the xmas period now she has a supply which should last several months ,best hot chocolate ever , great taste
without a doubt this cannot be surpassed i am always so about calorie count until i took a sip of this i will just it for special moments even the cat nose was from the delightful scent it is hard to believe that it was made in usa if my daughter is lucky i might send her some at christmas it is a good thing i live alone or else i would have to hide it ,best i ever tasted , not as good as it is
so i am a huge chocolate peanut butter freak and have been looking for a peanut butter cup cocoa for a while i finally broke down and ordered this after a few months and about it now i to not reading the directions the first cup and at first was like wow slightly chocolate water and added a few more spoonfuls of the mix to my cup and it improved but was not quite what i expected and this was made with water i was at work and had little choice the next day i to try it again at home in my hot cocoa machine with milk and there was a great improvement so as a result i am going to try an experiment tonight and make a shake in the blender with the mix i said im a peanut butter cup freak ,pretty good , not as good as it is
if you have not tried the stephens candycane cocoa you need to try it but only if you like chocolate and mint flavors it is great tasting the only problem is that i want it year around and it is only available in stores at christmas ,cocoa , not as good as it is
i tried stephen chocolate mint truffle hot chocolate mix at a function and it was wonderful i had to get some ,great hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
i have tried them all and keep coming back to the belgian chocolate a chocoholic dream i drink this every morning and this seem to be the most economical way to buy it cans at a time ,love it hard to find this at the store , great taste
it a little stronger it gives it a bold chocolate taste with a strong candycane kick i do not know what else to tell you except it is absolutely out of this world all you need is a cup a spoon hot water and stephen candycane cocoa you are set drink up just remember not to use it all up in one setting br br honestly the only thing i would change about this product is the number of cups of cocoa per can it calls for rounded tablespoons of cocoa mix per ounces of hot water when sara and i make a oz cup each and each have a refill we can almost kill off one can in a sitting yes it is that good i wish stephen could concentrate this or put it up in larger cans br br i hope i have helped in your purchasing decision ,hot cocoa is the best , best popcorn ever
well i love hot cocoa but this is truly different it literally has bits of candy cane mixed into the cocoa mix and it is a refreshing warm you from the inside out hot cocoa drink if you are someone that is not sold on peppermint in your hot cocoa you just have to try it the peppermint is very subtle but very pleasing to the palate truly different from any hot cocoa that i have ever enjoyed ,gourmet cocoa , not as good as it is
my husband is a huge fan of hot cocoa i surprised him with a pack of stephen peanut butter cup hot cocoa it actually has little peanut butter cups in it they quickly melt into this delicious treat we highly recommend this product and will buy it again ,more than a star review , great hot chocolate
i originally received this mint truffle hot chocolate as a gift and was a little bit dismayed that the instructions say to mix it with water because in the past that always results in a weak flavor amazingly that is not the case with this mix even with no milk added this has a great rich chocolate mint taste br br because it does not require milk i can keep it at work for a warm up drink on cold office days i usually put teaspoons of mix in my a href http www amazon com gp product b p y ounce recycled and recyclable tumbler a then add hot water from the dispenser at work for a perfect mug of hot chocolate ,great even when made with water , not as good as it is
i bought this hot chocolate at a grocery store because it looked interesting we like to drive around our neighborhood and look at the christmas lights i always like to drink hot chocolate while enjoying this oh my gosh this hot chocolate was incredible when i opened the can to make it i saw pieces of candycane candy in the chocolate powder i made it the way that they suggested with hot water not milk it was so creamy with just the right amount of peppermint flavor there were no lumps and it was excellent to the last drop i am thrilled to see that they carry this on amazon because i know that the grocery store only carried it for the holidays and the price on amazon is much less than i paid ,absolutely the best , great hot chocolate
expensive chocolate we have on in the past the tins go along ways too the per serving cost is a fraction of buying the individual packets at the grocery store of other brands but i would pay more anyway because this stuff is so good we just had to order another case try it with some coffee it up in some vanilla ice cream seems like they could sell it for much more if they got rid of the dude first name first name only brands really cheese up the product how about cocoa or divine cocoa or even now cocoa anything would up the product name a little i am a would you buy an expensive house from nope does not matter how choice the work is i am sorry stephen you do have a great product i will stop oh well keep the prices low five stars brother ,i agree , good but not great
i was looking for something to replenish one of my favorite black forest cherry chocolate hot mixes and this one works quite well and tastes even better keep up the good work ,best cherry chocolate that i have come , great hot chocolate
i love stephen gourmet hot chocolate it arrived quickly and we have been enjoying it for at least a month now ,great tasting hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
i just bought a six pack of stephen gourmet hot cocoa mix it is pretty good for the price my favorite will always be ghirardelli but this does the trick in a pinch ,not but not bad , not as good as it is
this is the perfect cocoa to sit by a fire listen the rain next to your loved ones i had to order it on amazon since it was only available in where i used to live i am so glad i ordered it choc is the best flavor but chocolate hazelnut chocolate mint and milk chocolate are also excellent ,great cocoa , great hot chocolate
i really enjoyed this and will probably be purchasing other flavors as well if they are re stocked it seems that most of them are sold out i wanted something a little better than what i find in my area grocery stores and this was really good the first time we made it it was with milk and it was a little too rich for me which i thought was impressive especially as i was only using skim milk so i have since moved to a combination of milk and water and it tastes great and i will probably still make it with just milk after more towards that over time my house is known for hot cocoa we have at least options right now but everybody who has had this has enjoyed it ,very tasty maybe a little too rich if making with milk , not as good as it is
has just enough of the raspberry taste without being over bearing will purchase more in the future when my supple i had trouble finding a good raspberry hot cocoa but now i know where to get it this site will be one of my favorites ,just what i wanted , good hot cocoa
do you like dark chocolate wish you could find quality dark chocolate cocoa mix this is the real deal i have tried a few different dark chocolate mixes this one stands above others in it is smooth ness and creamy quality nice and dark add some honey or cinnamon and you will have a fantastic cuppa cocoa ,delicious , great hot chocolate
i ordered the no sugar added version i usually like no sugar added or low sugar products ice cream yogurt hot chocolate etc but this one was terrible like the other reviewer this tasted like ovaltine i had to use like spoons of the powder to get the taste i do not know what to do with other cans i will probably donate ,horrible , not as good as it is
i have tasted several stephen gourmet products but the chocolate raspberry is my favorite it is creamy smoothe and delicious i consider it my one splurge for myself i have a cup every morning and have now shared my favorite beverage with my son who just cannot get enough of it he has created different recipes with it one using ice cream i will stick to the original method it is the best hot cocoa mix i have ever tasted the aroma alone will draw you in i am often asked what is that wonderful smelling beverage occasionally i will share in hopes they will purchase their own stephen gourmet makes the best cocoa ever i will drink it as long as they continue to make it ,it is the best , best hot cocoa i have ever had
my wife absolutely adores this cocoa very easy to make just hot water which for her is a plus br she prefers this over ghiradelli ,good cocoa , great taste
this really is the best hot chocolate i have ever tried and at this price a terrific deal it was delivered fast and as described a ,awesome , great hot chocolate
i love hazelnut smell in my coffee so i figure it will also be great to have it in a cup of hot chocolate unfortunately this product does not give me a strong hazelnut feeling just a little well it is still a good one ,hazelnut , great coffee
enjoy the taste milk free product milk in hot cocoa just cannot see adding powdered milk b u t it is considerably less expensive at a local chain grocery store in my area i prefer a mix of this and ghiradelli double ,delicious , good but not great
this is an ok hot cocoa i had been using land o product but wanted to try this for a change the taste is comparable but the portions in each packet is smaller i still like land o hot cocoa better ,so so , not as good as it is
this is the best candy cane cocoa and it has real bits of candy cane do not worry it is not totally sharp most of it dissolves in the liquid br br i mix my cocoa with a operated which uses every single bit of cocoa so there is not a single bit of cocoa on the bottom br br after it is really a cup of chocolate that is very lovely refreshing i would say br br this is a must with milk though i think you can do it with water but milk is best to get the full flavor effect ,real candy in this , not as good as it is
if you have read the other reviews about stephens hot chocolate well the same for this one it tastes rich and good i am diabetic type and there is nothing else in hot chocolate that comes close without being loaded with sugar diabetes really the field when it comes to things you can eat or drink so am glad that stephens makes this product in every shiny white there is a bit of soot hiding somewhere the lump of is that they do not sell it in canada and will not ship across the border that is so sad having to deal with yet another item they cannot get not sure why this is whether us government canadian border with a or stephens just do not want extra paper work thank goodness for friends who go on trips down south and bring it back for me good stuff ,gourmet hot chocolate , not as good as it is
purchased original can at walmart of course during the holidays it was not always there i got on amazon com and found a really good deal on it my family i loved it thru the holidays and will be taking a canister of it with us when we go camping and using it year round good good product taste ,gourmet hot cocoa , good stuff
cream topper and you have have a melt in the chair soft spot where of sugar plums and the like may begin to in your heads yummy and so delicious i have purchased twice first at near each for two then near each for six of them chalk it up to when you are buying i should make clear that i do not regret my initial purchase i was merely showing an example when timing can play a part in the value of this kind of transaction please allow me to that i initially retail sellers as i was trying the product and it seemed reasonable given the value for two to select them to complete my purchase i have no with the seller and would consider their on this open market again as the purchase made sense thank you for reading this far and for your consideration in advance ,yummy and in my tummy , not as good as i be
i also tried the cherry chocolate and peanut butter cup flavors and they are amazing so thick and creamy especially if you make it with a little milk what i really like is that they are not overly sweet and that it mixed together very well unlike most brands that just clump up and stick to the spoon definitely my favorite hot chocolate the cider flavors are great too ,good perfect , great taste
this is simply the best hot chocolate mix i have ever used the flavor is wonderful whether you like hazelnut or not the hazelnut flavor is subtle it tastes like you made it from scratch rather than a mix it is difficult to find so it on amazon was a great find ,hot hazelnut hot chocolate , great hot cocoa
i ordered this about a year ago and have ordered it since everyone i have shared it with has loved it so much they have also gotten right on amazon and ordered it also i mix it in my coffee and when i am feeling particularly top it off with whipping cream delicious ,totally , great coffee
delicious taste just like a chocolate covered cherry i especially like it added to coffee will give as gifts this year ,a favorite , delicious
stumbled across this and thought i would try it it is white even though cocoa is in the title in case you did not figure that out i did realize it was not chocolate but did not really know what to expect br br the best way i can describe it is that it tastes like a vanilla milkshake but hot i happen to love vanilla way more than chocolate ones but hate drinking milk go figure but somehow i gotten used to this product after about a week i have cans now so i have many more to try it may just be that i sort of expect hot chocolate and i have to my slow brain it is interesting and different and i still drink it and almost like it but still would pick pick the hot chocolate over this definitely worth a try if you like vanilla ,not exactly sure how to this , not bad but not as good as it is
this is my absolute favorite hot chocolate stephen hot cocoa is all over but i have been unable to find it anywhere else i love it so much that i even pay shipping and handling so that i can enjoy it all the way on the east coast too it is so good i look forward to it every year ,so good i order it , great hot cocoa
this is by far the best hot chocolate i have ever tasted all the other flavors are good especially the raspberry but this one is my favorite i use just hot water and it tastes rich and creamy ,the best hot cocoa mix ever , best hot cocoa ever
i am on my second can i ordered the case of and i keep it hidden from the grandkids i never thought you could have good tasting dark hot chocolate i just heat a cup of water in the microwave for seconds and add the chocolate it dissolves completely with stirring ,great taste , best hot chocolate ever
i am very glad to find this brand on amazon as it is rich flavor surpasses all others i have tried if you love dark chocolate this is it i have not tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good i may order some for stocking stuffers for christmas br br i also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug cup the pre measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an oz cup and most are oz so packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way if you would like very rich hot chocolate you can use milk and water you really do not need marshmallows ,the tasting hot cocoa i have ever tasted , a great hot cocoa for the price
what can i say this is delicious on any day sip til your heart content ,chocolate heaven , great taste
i love hot chocolate but do not drink milk this is the best hot chocolate i have tasted using just plain water ,best hot with water , great hot chocolate
i do not think there is a better hot cocoa especially at this price on the market than stephen it lasted me the entire winter and made for awesome x gifts now everyone i know buys it and i am even happier to be spreading it around my only issue is that i wish they would have a mixed pack a pack of mint hazelnut regular dark vanilla and irish cream would really be perfect ,no better cocoa , great hot cocoa
i love all of the cocoa in the stephen gourmet line but i think this one is my favorite the other people in my family have different favorites we all love stephen but we all agree the belgian dark ranks at the top for the best all purpose drinking cocoa br br i like my cocoa with a little added milk in it and starting out with a good dark cocoa allows me to achieve that milky texture without sacrificing that rich chocolate flavor br br as an added bonus stephen cocoa is labeled gluten free taking the out of choosing a cocoa for those of us who must avoid gluten containing additives such as barley malt a common ingredient in chocolate ,my favorite cocoa , great product
this stuff has an absolutely incredible taste very smooth and you can mix it with water or milk if you like vanilla and you have not tasted this stuff you are missing out br br get it it is worth it ,french vanilla cocoa wow , great taste
i love stephens chocolate raspberry it is the best i have ever had other brands i have tried were bitter and just not as tasty br it in smooth no lumps br my order arrived quickly just as promised i am a very happy consumer of this product and the supplier ,delicious hot chocolate , great hot chocolate
i tried this unknown manufacturer stephen and was pleasantly surprised it had a good amaretto flavor along with the chocolate the aroma is good i use it in my coffee for a homemade mocha taste ,good flavor , good coffee
use and a squirt of dark choc syrup and i am happy with that so i then mixed the belgian as i do with the nestle and it is ok i cannot rave about it due to the fact that it is higher in sugars and sodium than the nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration br to me dark chocolate should not be as sweet or sweeter as milk chocolate i am sure that is why i prefer dark chocolate i will even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times br br but as i have said it is all in your individual taste i just wish they would have listed the nutrient facts along with their ingredients br not bad just not all that great if you do not like really sweet hot chocolate ,taste is , not as good as it is
stephen is absolutely the best hot chocolate i have ever tasted it is so creamy and delicious every flavor i have ever tried is excellent my whole family loves it i do not know any stores in the area that sell it so we are thrilled to be able to order it through amazon ,heaven , best hot cocoa ever
i like the taste of chocolate and mint it mixed well when i added hot water next i might try a warm milk ,hot cocoa , great taste
this product contains partially hydrogenated oils which is very to your health i would rather pay more for a product which does not contain ,great tasting but , great product
i bought a case of this stuff dark chocolate based on the positive reviews big mistake this is half a step above swiss miss it is definitely not up to the level of target brand twinings some grocery stores or cadbury overseas or very few grocery stores br br cocoa is the th ingredient no chocolate as an ingredient bunch of fats and fillers has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the th and th ingredient that is more like it br br stephen chocolate has bad very light color little aroma thin does not dissolve a very disappointing purchase ,not a gourmet product , not as good as it is
i love hot chocolate and am always trying new ones but this was the absolute worst cherry hot chocolate i have ever tasted i was hoping it would be good so i bought cans after cup i threw both cans away if you want a really great cherry hot chocolate add teaspoons of the cherry juice from a jar of cherries to your favorite milk hot chocolate yum add more if you use dark hot chocolate ,awful , not as good as it is
it looks like a no fat br i added more than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so so br br i am just not impressed with the way the powder together and clumped and stuck to the spoon yuk br a can for serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for cents on sale for br the same amount of servings br granted amazon price is better than the manufactures website since there is no shipping through br here and shipping is at a premium through stephen gourmet br i would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first do not bother wasting your money to buy br lbs of cocoa mix at one time you might end up doing what i will have to do when you do not like it br sigh br give it away ,does not live up to the , not as good as i be
unfortunately i did not notice this until i received the product i guess i will be giving it away to friends family that do not mind it br br tastes artificial like coffee creamer br br ingredients br sugar sweet whey maltodextrin partially hydrogenated coconut oil cocoa processed with alkali corn syrup solids non fat dry milk natural artificial flavor sodium caseinate a milk salt mono and diglycerides dipotassium phosphate carrageenan soy lecithin ,has coconut oil , not as good as it is
this review is for their dark chocolate most who like dark chocolate are into the pure chocolate taste and its health effects not the sweetness just as with good coffee its not necessary to make it overly sweet or flavored since there are not that many sweet freak drinking it the ancient did not use any sugar at all with their chocolate br br i did give it an extra star just for having a dark chocolate drink product since their are not many companies that even make one so kudos to them for that ,too sweet , not as good as it is
to qualify as such br br i added more than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so so br br i am just not impressed with the way the powder together and br clumped and stuck to the spoon yuk br a can for serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for cents on sale for br the same amount of servings br granted amazon price is better than the manufactures website since there is no shipping through br here and shipping is at a premium through stephen gourmet br i would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first do not bother wasting your money to buy br lbs of cocoa mix at one time you might end up doing what i will have to do when you do not like it br sigh br give it away ,drink vanilla baby formula then this is for you , not as good as i be
the company does not operate properly i ordered the french vanilla that is the selection i on and i recieved the white chocolate they should contact a buyer before shipping a substitution ,surprise and switch , good stuff
opened it up and all of the cans were chocolate i thought they sent the wrong kind i checked my order and found out i indeed ordered the wrong flavor see the canisters look exactly the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle that is the only difference between the canisters and since the initial on amazon are so small it is easy to not see such a little difference yes its technically my fault but they need more difference in on the canisters not only that amazon would not take it back even though it all was unopened because its food and the company who makes it basically said sorry but it sucks to be you so here i sit dollars worth of hot chocolate which no one can use ,warning make sure you are buying the right flavor , not a good product
this is a horrible step by pop to change the formula they now use cheap barley malt sugar high glycemic in place of most of the honey and only a amount of the herbs which were so effective in the original formula huge disappointment and shame on pop for and their once outstanding products br br as with the other reviewer i once recommended this to everyone now i will go out of my way to steer clear of recommending anything by prince of peace try source naturals wellness cough formulas they are much cleaner and work pretty well ,changed the formula totally different product , great product
i love the honey i have been using it for years and i am sharing it with other ,i love my honey , delicious
price was misleading once the high shipping rate was added the tea was no longer the deal it was to be although once it finally arrived it was half decent tea but not worth the shipping and the wait will go to my local tea house next time ,r , great tea
i love really good coffee and in fact go to great to brew the best i e freshly ground beans water coffee maker etc i have been extremely happy with virtually all of jeremiah coffees and i have a number of different beans on hand at all times the breakfast blend is stand out also try this and their you will not be disappointed ,coffees , great coffee
an organic coffee for less than a pound with subscribe and save with great taste you cannot beat that this is my only coffee choice for now i would rather have this than starbuck any day of the week ,excellent taste excellent price for organic , great coffee
i have jeremiah pick coffee organic breakfast blend whole bean coffee more than times however the last lot i received with really bad quality lots of broken coffee beans and very oily hope the seller can check what happen i may not try it again ,disappointed , good coffee
this coffee is phenomenal for the taste and value i am on subscribe and save and this is my daily brew i typically go though lbs a month or so this coffee has an excellent flavor and is not bitter or spicy beats starbucks breakfast blend hands down ,my daily brew , good coffee
i was really disappointed in this coffee it is a darker roast than i was expecting and the bag has no expiration date my coffee tasted quite stale and old ,stale , not as good as
my senses were surprised by the aroma of the beans as well as the satisfying flavor of the brew br i substituted this bean when amazon dropped starbucks sumatra from their subscribe save program br now i would never go back br i use a cone drip filter into a for our brew br for an organic bean this breakfast blend is top of the br ,surprised , great product
this is the best tasting coffee at the most reasonable price for organic smooth taste perfect for your morning brew ,great price great taste , great coffee
you get a fresh bold thick flavor from this coffee never bitter i am addicted i blend it with there decaf at night so that i can sleep great price ,this is the best coffee , good coffee
this has become our new coffee of choice for the mornings it is a good price for a solid cup of organic coffee beans are medium roast and very fragrant ,great coffee great price , great coffee
the organic breakfast blend has an appealing mild flavor it is very reasonably priced for an organic coffee i will definitely be buying more in the future ,great coffee , great coffee
a great coffee that is medium roast not bitter yet it tastes as good as it smells it is also well bagged to maintain optimum freshness mmmmmmm ,organic breakfast blend , good coffee
this is my second batch of coffee from jeremiah pick this is good coffee but not as good as their however it you like a mild yet tasteful coffee you will like this i prefer a bit stronger brew though hence my preference for the ,good coffee , not as good as it is
the jeremiah lb bag of coffee is often sold out so i have been looking for a good roast with similar value i am ok with a more medium roast but this coffee seems more mild then i would have expected still a good deal but i wish it had more flavor in general i have had good luck with jeremiah brand although sometimes the bags are not as well sealed as they should be ,ok not that flavorful , good coffee
i liked everything about the transaction although i am sure that i ordered ground but i received whole bean i especially liked the price and the speed of delivery ,so far so good , not as good as
cinnamon toast have always been a favorite for me and my family its good and crispy if u dont let it in milk to much br as far as price value its a pretty darn good deal i think at costco u can get a similar price for there twin pack according to my aunt but i dont have a membership with them so i stick to amazon enjoy just keep in mind just as other cereals it has lots of sugars and carbs so eat wise and stay sharp ,what can i say its good , great taste
we love this cereal i purchased this product and everything was great the cereal was good until jan but of course my family has already eaten the cereal gone in like two weeks we do eat these as a snack more than anything i would recommend buying this cereal ,great , great product
as usual this cereal tastes so good the boxes came quickly and timely i wish this deal did not stop ,crunch , great taste
this is one of the few cereals that i find very tasty just on its own as a snack or as dessert crunchy with a nice cinnamon flavor it is very sweet however i prefer to mix it with something such as cheerios when eating it for breakfast since the sugar can be overpowering as you get close to the bottom of the bowl br br good value if you can get it on an amazon price dip and or when they run a ,tasty on its own but a bit too much sugar , great taste
there has been no to the formula these treats taste just like they did in when i first used to pour them into my mouth and since they are wrapped in smaller packages of three sticks oh sorry they can be for my southern friends for a lot longer ,you a to the , good for you
these fruit filled rawhide donuts are wonderful our yellow lab goes nuts when we just take one out of the pantry best eaten outside or on the kitchen floor not because little pieces of the fruit do drop out during the feast our dog loves the fruity part so much he licks them up br a dog may be man best friend but these are definitely a dog best friend cannot recommend them enough ,a dog best friend , my dog loves these
easy to follow directions the grass grew fast and strong my dogs are eating it right now and i know it safe and healthy ,my dogs love it , my dog loves it
i bought this for my and he loves it br br its insanely easy to grow it seems like it grows an inch by the second square will definitely last me for more than a few weeks br br if you are looking to grow your own wheat grass look no further this stuff is awesome ,grass , great product
and deliver grass as promised br br i have to say though that the grass does not look at all like the wheatgrass in stores the blades are way inches and about twice the thickness of the wheatgrass i am used to buying for my bunny i took pictures but discovered that my memory card does not fit this new computer so i cannot show buyers a picture of it since have sensitive digestive and you have to be careful what you feed them i do not feel safe feeding this grass to her i cannot return it because i cracked open the kit and grew grass from one of the three seed kits the grass is probably but as a bunny owner i want other bunny owners to know that this grass is not like the wheatgrass in stores so they are not surprised and disappointed like i was ,not like the in stores , not as good as i be
i was having trouble finding pet grass consistently in my area and decided to take a chance using a grow kit the kit was very easy to use and the grass grew like crazy since i have only one cat i am now using about of soil and seeds at a time and this works out great i highly recommend this product ,love this grass , great product
i tasted this matcha from the first time today the flavor is bright and fresh it mixes nicely into both hot and cold liquids leaving no clumps of tea at the bottom of my glass after it was the tea powder is fine giving it smoothness no or grainy feel i had it both in water and with milk in both the flavor was not the flavor is more intense bold than most matcha i have had making others seem bland by comparison nothing off putting just seems more concentrated it has a good crisp green color and each packet holds about one tablespoon of matcha i am glad this order was for a pack of because i can see myself going through one box quickly ,flavor smooth on the , not as good as it is
i love it tastes great and it is very convenient to use my husband drinks that in the car instead of soda or juice lt just pour the powder to oz water bottle and shake well directions on the box say to use ml oz but the tea is really strong so we use l bottle my kids love it i love it in whole food box costs tax here you can get boxes for the price if you use all currently off still quite expensive but well worth it ,healthy refreshing tea for summer , great taste
tea and how it was really good for the immune system due to my with illness and deciding to follow the advice of a person who spoke highly of the health benefits of this tea i decided to buy it unfortunately i get blood work done on a regular basis and after nine weeks there was no noticeable change improvement to justify the expense of this product it did nothing to improve my health and the lack of improvement in my blood work this so i am no longer going to buy it i would buy it if i could pay around for a month supply for just one tea serving daily but not it is not worth it br br the only reason i am giving this product four stars is because it does taste very good especially with a few of liquid stevia extract added to the mixture ,great tasting but a bit pricey , not bad
first the product pictured is not what you get br br what you really get is are tiny packets called sticks suitable for flavoring bottled water the box does not even say what size bottle it is sized for br br i m not keeping it so i cannot tell you how it tastes ,do not , not as good as it is
packed in peanuts one gets forced excercise picking up these small but peace of mind off the br floor ok a few calories are used in this way and if you are female you can imagine yourself to be from the doing some however i prefer to have my when i desire to have them and to excercise when i decide to excercise and not have these things suddenly and forced upon me when opening up a package especially from such a luxury goods as gourmetfoodstore truly is perhaps a charge for having one goods not to be packed in peanuts might be please do not make it more than bubble wrap and similar plastic space fillers are so appreciated by customer and less leads to less buying of and pain possibly allowing for more money to be spent at gourmetfoodstore please consider these suggestions for happier dear gourmetfoodstore thanks ,t i e t a t e d b e t t e r , not as good as i be
this is what i consider to be true ginger beer it tastes like very strong ginger ale it has a bite to it it is with refined sugar not raw sugar so it doesnt have that strange taste ,ginger beer from jamaica , not as good as it is
the mushrooms that were sent were not labeled like the picture they had the old red and black label when i opened the can and tasted them the had a very metallic taste and the inside of the can was so i threw them away rather than take a chance of making myself sick there is a date code on the top of the can of which i have no idea what that means and i cannot find any of this code online i will not buy this brand mushrooms anymore i am a mushroom lover and i have bought many large cans of mushrooms in the past and i have never had them taste like these did ,not good , not as good as i have

i meant to order chocolates and got this one by mistake yikes not a good outcome the chocolate is poor and the gel like liquor is worse don t make the mistake that i made ,not very special liquor ordered this by , not as good as it is

you know how the chocolate turns light brown when it gets old that is how these were at the top they were that lighter shade of brown as if they were old that part just did not taste right but the liquor inside was good these candies were not fresh ,old , good but not great

this product is great i have never tried any liquor filled chocolate candies chocolates but i got to say these were a great little surprise i am not good at describing food or candy but these were little bottle chocolates that are filled with liquid which is nicely mixed with liquor some of these were stronger than others in a sense that some of them you can really feel instantly while others you only taste chocolate br br i shared these with my friends and they seem really happy when they tried it there are four different chocolates i would definitely recommend this to everybody you just have to be careful these chocolates have liquor in them so use at caution great little gift for myself ,delicious , great taste

super fast shipping i have not tried the chocolates yet but will at christmas and leave another review then but the chocolates came in excellent condition and just like pictured i followed advise on another comment to go to the company website and save a few bucks thank you ,very fast shipping , not as good as it is
the liquor filled chocolates arrived in perfect condition and were securely but packaged i am unable to comment on the flavor as they were purchased for a gift the secure packaging me from sampling the various flavors ,liquor chocolates , great taste
delivery of the product was quick however the items are smaller than how they appear on line next time i would order the larger size ,much smaller than the picture one to believe , good for you
i got these for my boyfriend for christmas they are a bit smaller then what i figured they would be from the box i havent given them to him yet of course but i am sure we will have fun trying them the box came two day earlier then what amazon said they would come which is nice ,very cool gift , good for you
an otherwise good gum reduced to a three star review by really mind packaging i fail to see the advantage of the foil covered capsule approach i lose approximately one piece a pack by pressing just the wrong way and having the gum out of the package like a forever lost br br the gum itself is decent lasts for slightly less than a twenty five minute car drive packs a comfortable punch and improves breath still it is not outstanding and does not overcome the poor packaging so will not be buying any more ,what is the deal with the packaging , not as good as it is
fast shipping items were packaged nicely and are as described also very tasty highly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy ,awesome , great product
this is real stevia extract without any additives most of the companies that claim to be selling stevia are really selling stevia extract combined with other things like fiber or artificial sweeteners but this is the real deal it is extremely sweet which means you only have to use a small amount at a time and you should melt it with hot water if you plan to put it in a cold drink stevia also tastes a little different some describe it as tasting like licorice but i never thought so i suggest starting with the smallest amount and then the quantity until you find a level of sweetness that tastes good to you because of stomach problems this is the only sweetener i use and i like it very much i highly recommend it ,real stevia extract with no , the best
compared with truvia or other stevia plus other sweetener products it is considerably less expensive and the taste is pure not multi layered if you want to enhance the flavor and it does not with your diet regimen consider adding a squirt of honey or a dash of table sugar to your beverage i am looking forward to a hot cocoa recipe chocolate and cocoa seem to mask flavors very effectively i am not sure how to use stevia for baking that will take some experimentation and most likely require combining stevia with other wholesome sweeteners br in all i have only tried truvia once in tea and i found that it had an almost effect on my tongue and considerably less sweetness than stevia many sweeteners come in single serving packets and as a result they are considerably more expensive per serving why not start with a pure product ,great product easily and value priced , not as good as i be
best tasting sugar substitute i have ever found either for beverages or for cooking but it is very concentrated so it takes a bit of experimentation to get it to taste good but after you have found the amount you like best it is absolutely fabulous it even has a nice slight aftertaste that when adjusted properly makes it taste even better than plain old sugar br br another drawback is that it does not mix easily into liquids but with practice that becomes no problem either it is much better than another product that is supposed to mix more easily but has a weird taste that is not nearly as delicious as stevia extract it does not mix that much better either br br i just wish amazon would always keep in stock the larger size oz stevia extract containers sometimes the small ones are all that is available ,delicious sugar substitute , the best water i have ever had
this is my favorite form of stevia it is highly concentrated so one small bottle lasts a long time i have a container near me all the time at work and at home it is also the best tasting stevia that i have tried and is a good company and the price is great ,love this stevia , great product
i recieved my stevia a couple of weeks ago and it is excellent my only problem is that the four containers were little more than half way filled but the total amount of stevia is sufficient and i have been using it everyday and i have not used much br overall for the price it is excellent ,good purchase , great product
only once before have i tasted a better chocolate covered coconut and that was long ago and far away the dark chocolate is and it is very addicting ,best of the best , best chocolate ever
my month year old spotted these on his own while shopping at the supermarket and i had to overlook the for oz bag and just be glad that was what he was asking for the amazon price is somewhat better but higher then just tomatoes actual website i only question why at this price is all the fruit not sourced from the usa i find that a bit hard to believe but i guess everyone has to make a living some of the fruit is from the crunch of the fruit satisfies when in the need for a snack the fact that he is getting used to a non sugar snack as a special treat hopefully will his for fruits in their natural state the oz bag does have a lot in it more then i would have thought before buying ,great all fruit snack , delicious and healthy
these are very handy when fresh fruit is not available i bought them for my month old and i to enjoy however they are a little too crunchy and sour for her to eat straight from the bag maybe some of other the other dried just fruit varieties are less tart overall they are nice to have on hand they lose some of their tartness when stirred in cereal or yogurt also good for baking ,crunchy tart , good but not great
they made a great impression on our family members great to celebrate the birth of our second child the chocolate was very tasty and believe me i know chocolate ,loved them , great snack
i bought these cigars and some bubble gum ones everybody loved the chocolate ones not so much the bubble gum ones besides having a nice presentation people said the chocolate was actually really good i would buy these over the bubble gum ones again br br the only thing i wished was if they gave you more than just too bad there was not a jumbo pack because these cigars went fast ,good chocolate nice packaging , good but not great
much about the product itself was a gift for friends in california who had just given birth and it arrived days after shipping totally melted the seller gave early warning before shipping stating the weather had been hot and that they could not be held responsible for packages missed and left to sit in the heat i assumed that was not an issue considering my wife was at their home and aware the package would be arriving and i had also purchased shipping additional dollars no such luck be sure whoever you are buying these from gives you absolute specifics before you buy br just to be fair i have to say the seller was very quick and courteous with to my concerns unfortunately she did not even consider any form of though i really hate throwing money away and giving a less than memorable gift at the same time ,how many days for shipping , the best for the price
i used to live in ky as a kid i was actually born and raised there but moved to in my early i moved back to ky a while ago and can enjoy this anytime now i am very in that aspect but out west it was so hard to be w o cannot say enough about how good this product is very good for mixing w some good old shine or bourbon it is a ginger ale but nothing like your typical variety br br give it a try and see for yourself ,miss but this helps me home , not as good as it is
ale is the best thing about kentucky it far any other ginger ale product on the market both because of the delicious taste and because unlike most other ginger ale drinks it includes caffeine for that extra shot of energy ,best thing about , best hot cocoa ever
vanilla beans typically run dollars for two at major supermarkets those prices make me reluctant to use them in most dishes that call for them and instead i use vanilla bean paste williams and sonoma sells a very good product but these beans are such a good deal less than a fifth the supermarket price that now i am willing to use them with almost vanilla beans really do provide superior flavor to things like rice pudding and and vanilla ice cream a more complex more flavor than vanilla extract does these beans arrived fresh fragrant and tightly bagged they are madagascar vanilla beans considered by some to be inferior to beans but not being one of the i cannot detect much difference at all this product has made me a fan of internet grocery shopping ,fragrant delicious and cheap , good but not great
vanilla beans in our area cost for one and up to for two i like to make my own vanilla extract and i also like vanilla flavored sugar which requires whole beans i probably have a lifetime supply of vanilla beans now but with amazon excellent price on this item i can use them and order again if i need to thanks amazon ,excellent buy , not as good as it is
gp product b cuisinart ice automatic quart ice cream maker white a this summer as well as a couple of great recipe books the perfect scoop by david and the old fashioned ice cream cookbook by most of the recipes in each book call for vanilla beans in fact almost on them have you priced them recently yikes so i turned to my amazon com site searched for vanilla beans and found these i could not be more pleased they are moist flexible and have a very nice flavor i particularly like that they come in packages of two so the remainder stay fresh who knew vanilla beans were not crunchy after i have soaked the ice cream mixture i dry the bean and put it in a jar with sugar so next time i see a recipe for vanilla sugar i will not have to i highly this product ,i will never buy vanilla beans at the store again , great product
this is a good deal on whole vanilla beans which i mostly use for making my own extract with br br i stick them in the freezer to preserve so it is buying so many at once and getting the bulk deal on these ,i them , good but not great
great product for the price only negative would be the packaging since i keep mine in the freezer a single package of or or whatever would be sufficient i make a coffee chocolate liquor for adult use as a syrup over ice cream these beans add additional depth to the flavor of the sauce ,best vanilla beans , great coffee
purchased for making homemade vanilla ice cream slightly smaller beans than expected but overall flavor and price expensive local bought beans ,good flavor and value , good but not great
nice alternative if you cannot find them locally great gift for the avid cook ,price good quality , good
i have a small gourmet business and have a couple of dessert items i use vanilla beans for one recipe calls for full vanilla beans for each recipe one can image how expensive that would be at per bean this box was an incredible buy at just over per bean the beans are supple and their flavor is very good as another reviewer mentioned they are not the most bean but for most purposes they are excellent i highly recommend this purchase for anyone who uses a lot of vanilla beans or who can find someone to share them with i do not know how long they will remain fresh because i have not had that issue but as quickly as i use them i do not expect to this is a tremendous value ,great value , great product
my cats all love this product just like they love the other flavors i dare not run out of these treats or i might have a kitty ,cats love it , cat cat cat
bottom line this made my cat vomit i have never had a problem with him eating friskies before but i knew just did not sound right it came as a sample in one of the larger bags not fun to clean up after partial digestion ,poor kitty , not as good as it is
my cats go crazy for the party mix and mainly the cheese flavor it sells for br to a pouch in my local stores so i was looking on amazon hoping to find a better br price i looked at this listing because of the price of assuming it was for several br pouches like most of the other listings here but no number of pouches was listed and the br only indication comes from looking at the shipping weight this apparently the price br for a single pouch this is a problem with amazon quantities are not always posted br and you can really get ripped off i saw one review for friskies canned br food where the reviewer thought she was ordering a pack for but the br actual number was not posted and she ended up receiving one can ,how many , cat cat food
top grade vanilla beans these are about three times bigger than the regular beans br excellent quality incredible aroma and flavor highly recommended ,high quality , great product
or even juice without ever realizing you have consumed them i have also found that adding these seeds to my breakfast keeps me fuller longer br chia seeds are more convenient than flax seeds and a pound of them costing around depending on the seller lasts a few months br if you want to avoid the potential of fish oil supplements chia seeds are a great alternative and for new or expecting mothers they are a great way to ensure your baby is getting what s he needs for optimum brain health and development br lastly you do not have to be considering to consider adding chia to your diet it is a wonderful all natural supplement that is perfectly in both taste and cost to br who would have thought that the seeds responsible for the chia pet would offer so much more than a table br highly recommended ,of the , great taste
chia seeds best known for the chia pet are high in protein x the calcium of milk and high in omega oils chia seeds are seeds of an herb and are grown in mexico south central america and were the food of the br br i would think you could make faux tapioca pudding with just coconut milk chia seeds sweetener but i do not know how well the chia would absorb the coconut milk since it is so fatty can of coconut milk cup chia seeds sweetener to taste i make it with cups of water scoops of whey protein then i soak one cup of chia seeds in this and when it has up i add cans of coconut milk and sweetener sometimes i cream a package of cream cheese into a can of pumpkin cinnamon and add that for more nutrition for a pumpkin pie tapioca pudding ,healthy fun food , great for my
chia seeds are a great healthy food to add to your diet i make chia gel by mixing them with water c per tablespoon of seeds then stir the gel into yogurt oatmeal smoothies it is flavorless and the seeds have a pleasant crunch this brand is high quality and i would not hesitate to recommend it ,great quality awesome product , my cats love these
really do give a feeling of do to a severe sensitivity to caffeine and any sort of i wanted to try something natural that would not raise my my heart and just not make me overall jittery these do the trick when i drink a meal replacement drink i still feel inside and want to snack by adding a full rounded table spoon of seeds after a few minutes i feel nice and full these can be tossed into a powdered drink a canned ready to go drink milkshake type and even into a vitamin water but believe me when i say you must consume quickly or you will need a spoon they turn into a jello consistency quick which actually is not bad either you can bulk up a calorie pudding snack by stirring in a teaspoon or so many ways to get creative with the chia seeds enjoy ,great but eat fast , a little
i make chia gel with this and add a large spoonful to my yogurt and fruit in the morning i tried to make cookies with the gel and that was a failure great for in sauces to add bulk without fat easy to sprinkle on top of any food product too since they have virtually no taste very versatile and easy to eat ,great product , great for
chia seeds are an amazing nutritional and to me they do not even really taste like anything which is a positive no funky taste here they are great sprinkled on salads added to a smoothie used to make raw vegan pudding etc its uses are many br br also i wanted to add that this is a really good price my co op charges almost lb for chia seeds and amazon has them for just over ,i love chia seeds , not as good as it is
i just started eating these recently after hearing about all of their positive qualities and the omega bit i was expecting to take a spoonful and swallow it like medication instead i decided to mix it into my strawberry kefir i love the way the little seeds swell up and give the kefir a little bit of a chewy texture it reminds me of those asian drink places that add the tapioca or lychee pieces to fruit smoothies they are great be aware though after you eat these that they are little black seeds and they seem to love to stick between your teeth i look like some kind of nasty old with chewing tobacco all over my mouth if i do not after eating them br br this bag is a nice size and i think it will last a while worth the price ,a great texture to foods , great product
i do not know if chia seeds are really a super food but this brand seems to be very good quality i have bought other kinds and these look better and since i only eat them sprinkled on my morning cereal it is not that expensive to buy this higher priced brand ,good quality , great product
seems to have a much better time than my local whole foods and the price is unbeatable my favorite smoothie is cup of almond milk scoop of wheat grass or amazing grass a huge spoon of whatever nut butter is in freshly made teaspoon chia seeds tablespoon hemp seeds or hemp protein powder tablespoon cacao nibs two huge handfuls of spinach a banana and ice this me over from am until i eat lunch around the chia contribute a lot since they gel up when in contact with liquid they leave you feeling fuller for longer i would prefer to give stars for nutritional benefits and ease of but like i said the taste is lacking it is not nutty despite their claims it is really a non flavor and wish they did not lead you to believe most people would want to just snack on these as they are ,good for your belly good for your , good for my cat
they have a rather mild taste you can even use them as sprinkles on a dessert i have made a vanilla tapioca pudding with them i also add them to salads because chia seeds eventually turn into a gel if left in a liquid for a period of time you can use them to thicken br br are vegan and therefore vegetarian fish is how most individuals omega fatty acids in their diet these seeds are fish free br br provide energy can be a great supplement to take before intense or on days when you are feeling sluggish let these seeds soak in some juice or low calorie coconut milk like so delicious to help you through the rest of your day br br come in a bag that is resealable you do not have to struggle to close the bag it opens easily and closes just as easily ,lots of for , great for my
i would buy chia seeds at costco instead it is pounds for and i use them in smoothies over salads and lately i mix them in with chocolate almond milk for amazing pudding in hours chilled ,awesome , great for
i could not wait to get my package of these little seeds because of the health benefit they provide and plus i am trying to lose some weight i have only tried them once but they made a lovely pudding br cup coconut milk br chia seeds br tablespoon of cocoa powder i used amazing grass chocolate powder because it is all i had br tablespoon cinnamon br tablespoon honey br br mix well in a container or small bowl making sure to the cocoa powder br cover and place on a counter for about minutes stirring a few times br br it will turn into a wonderful gelatin esque yummy dessert ,makes yummy , great product
i have been consuming about tablespoon twice per day soaked for at least minutes followed by an equal amount of water they help me feel more full throughout the day and thus i am able to consume less calories the additional protein and fiber is an added bonus ,great , great product
the joy in eating them if there is any is in the texture crunch they provide some other brands had what i assume was matter which made the texture or worse hard like having little rocks in the mix br br my for adding them to my diet was to increase my omega intake from plant sources and add more fiber as well i have noticed improvement in my overall health since eating them but i cannot say for sure if chia played any in that because i changed my diet in many other ways and greatly increased my work out schedule just to be safe i am going to continue eating chia every morning and adding it as often as possible for other meals throughout the day br br as a very happy customer i plan on continuing my subscription to navitas naturals chia seeds for a long time ,pleased , not as good as the
these are much better quality than the cheaper seeds i bought on another site originally i had them on a six month subscription a pound twice a year but i have changed it to monthly ,chia , great product
an egg replacement in baked goods on sushi to make chia fresca a energy drink or just straight up have a spoonful i recently made pancakes and threw in a few tablespoons and it worked out great br br one thing to note is these seeds can stick in your teeth so be sure to do a quick check after eating them br br this brand br i have not bought any other brand of chia seeds but this one works so why switch seeds tasted fresh when i opened the package and stayed fresh during the months it took me to go through my bag bag is resealable price on amazon was better than in stores a good buy br br overall i am feeling pretty good about eating chia seeds instead of cupcakes although that has me thinking next kitchen experiment lemon chia cupcakes bye bye poppy seeds ,healthy and versatile , great product
i have heard a bunch of great things about chia seeds i love the texture it adds to juices i honestly have not felt much benefit form eating the seeds in terms of strength etc but it has helped in cleaning out my system and keeping health on my mind but i love the ritual of mixing something healthy and natural in my juices and i love the texture ,love it do not me why , great product
was crazy i mean they are chia seeds enough said anyway i tried them because i will try just about anything if someone tells me it is good for me and i will like it and as it turns out it is both of those things these little seeds are about the size of sesame seeds maybe a little smaller and have a very mild nutty taste they can be added to just about anything and are packed with omega fats fiber and a little protein they have got fat but not the bad french fries and kind the good kind that your body uses to keep your heart and everything else healthy and by the way these do not have to be ground or chewed up like flax in order for your body to get all the goodies from them you can just eat them the way they are ,surprisingly good , good for you
great for making tapioca like pudding with none of the carbs i like to make chia gel and add that to iced teas and smoothies the texture kind of reminds me of it is a good source of omega s magnesium and calcium also the combination of fiber and fat digestion and blood sugar spikes i will be buying this in bulk when i run out ,for chia , great for
a friend of mine has been the benefits of chia seeds for years so i finally decided to give them a try i really like them br br i have not tried making tapioca or pudding like some of the other reviewers have instead i usually toss a tablespoon into my protein smoothies or into my granola greek yogurt goji berry mixture br br as others have mentioned they do swell up after they have been in liquid for awhile but i have found that as long as i drink my smoothie within minutes or so of making it it is fine br br since adding chia seeds goji berries and soy lecithin into my diet last month i have noticed that my skin seems brighter and smoother and i have more energy ,healthy food at a good price , not as good as i be
i really enjoy adding these seeds to my smoothies they add a nice texture just the right amount of crunch and i think they taste like kiwi seeds i hear they are healthy too ,delicious seeds , great snack
great tasting wholesome goodness at a fair price i put these little seeds on everything chia has a n excellent shelf life and navitas packages their product in a resealable bag to ensure freshness ,goodness , delicious
i love chia seeds i got the info from watching dr oz and thought i would try them in an attempt to eat healthier i love them in just about everything i use them in my oatmeal and my fruit salad at lunch time i am much fuller after using chia seeds and also have more energy bottom line is i remain feeling full much longer i also have better bowel movements important with the medications i have been on for yrs it could be all in my mind but i feel better since starting the chia seeds i d be a great commercial for these folks now i just need to get them in a bigger size ,i use chia seeds daily love them , great product
these tiny seeds really work other than getting stuck in my teeth they keep me full offer additional fiber and have little to no taste and i received my order super fast great product and ,great , great product
i really liked this product and am sad that i cannot get it with subscribe and save anymore why not ,please come back , great product
read one of the chia books out there this really is a super food br br the only down side is the price here on amazon chia can now be found in many grocery stores in the bulk for around lb bag here is ridiculous ,they are amazing , not as good as it is
i add chia seeds to my morning shake for breakfast and i am in love with them they taste great almost like tiny but better this particular bag last a long time considering i consume them daily they are also cheaper than most stores def recommend this product ,chia seeds , great product
i would never tried chia seeds before but i am trying to be more health conscious so i ordered this with the intent to put them in my overnight oatmeal they are great a little goes a long long way i had no problems with bloating they taste like nothing and they pack a nutritional i have since added them to quinoa and couscous and have a bread recipe i am planning to try great value i will buy them again ,great , great product
off by the steep in market price tag navitas naturals chia seeds purchased via amazon are half the price of the in store product i was worried about how long it would take for them to arrive and also about how fresh they would be since seeds can spoil and become rancid the product arrived within days and was fresh and delicious i have since been using it in smoothies in place of flax seed and creating very nutritious desert blends they have a texture similar to tapioca but smaller when mixed with liquid i am a fan and would encourage you if you are interested in your diet with chia seeds to look up recipes on line and experiment do your pocket book a favor though and skip the super market or health food store for chia seeds the mark up is high purchase navitas naturals chia seeds online ,delicious nutritious and a great buy , a great product

if you put two teaspoons of chia seeds in a bowl of vanilla almond milk and let it sit for a couple of hours it makes the seeds more bearable to eat ,they are chia seeds , great product
these are great in juice mix what i usually do is mix a tablespoon or two in a glass with half way filled water stir for the next minute or two this is to keep the seed separated so they do not stick together in small chunks do this and they will float in the drink mix then fill up the glass with your prefer choice of juice or organic juice guava coconut etc stir in a tiny bit of a href http www amazon com gp product b j pure stevia extract powder oz powder a let the drink sit for at least minutes remember to stir it every minute so that the gel coat on those seeds are formed evenly and they will float drop in a cube or two of ice when ready to serve you ll be amazed ,great in water mix , great product

okay so the doctor did not order these but i read about a lot of their benefits and love adding them to smoothies etc the product came fresh and is definitely a good buy will be ordering again ,just what the ordered , not as good as it is
of my absolute favorite soup so i do not think i will try it in that one again lentil i drink my smoothies quick so i add these as the last step and i do not think they have much time to swell the seeds themselves are pretty tasteless to me just little black dots warning they will stick in your teeth seriously these are an at home item only when i can brush my teeth or well after do not try them at work or before a big meeting etc overall i do not think they have changed my world but a good little supplement boost and amazon had them easy to get and a great price compared to my local market i took off a star because of the tooth concerns but otherwise i was not expecting magic they met my expectations and came fresh and well packaged ,my hard to find they in teeth , great product

we use these in smoothies pancakes waffles and even our vegan burger patties you do not notice them but they add a great consistency and texture and it also helps as a agent in place of eggs ,a real super food , great product
i am very happy with this product it was less expensive here than at my local whole foods and having purchased other navitas items i can say that it is quickly becoming a favorite brand ,great buy great brand , good stuff
i add a teaspoon to my protein powder for additional nutrition and because they have no flavor the chocolate taste is not affected plus chia seeds thicken my concoction ,good , good

i really like them i add them to my smoothies for lunch and it makes them more filling and i like the flavor ,great , great taste
vegan and take my nutrition very seriously all the hype about what a chia seeds were i figured this was just the next new thing i did some research looked at the nutritional benefits and facts and figured if i hated them it would not be too long until i finished the pouch i make cream of wheat in the morning with a tablespoon of flaxseeds one cup of almond milk one cup water and tablespoons of a nut mixture i made of raw almonds cashews walnuts dried blueberries cranberries and golden raisins i make it loose so i feel fuller longer the chia seeds let me keep the volume of breakfast without adding too many calories now my cream of wheat is not so soup like and it has extra fiber protein and the good fats i am pleased with this product and am going to to use it ,worth the buy , good but not great
flax seeds br br upon arrival i opted to use these in my salad as opposed to the flax seeds i have been using br br the chia seeds caused the most horrible and painful bloating i ever experienced granted i did use the full serving size but since then i lowered the amount and still with even just a quarter of a teaspoon or less i get the bloating br br i have since switched back to the flax seeds which did not on my intestinal tract br br i am hoping i can find some way to use these seeds in the future because i hate seeing anything go to waste br br my advice if you are set on trying the chia seeds is to start out with a very low amount and stick with that low amount until your stomach up a tolerance for these seeds ,dont use too much in one meal , good but not great
i bought this product not that many months ago and loved it but no longer buying this brand because it doubled in price i bought it for originally will buy another brand ,the price , great product
i bought these to put in smoothies and they do not totally grind up in the blender i am going to try to grind them by hand before i add to the blender it all depends on your texture preference i do not mind seeds from fruits but these me ,its a , not as good as it is
tried one bag to test out and liked them enough to order three more bags i make sp using chia water and lime juice and i also have been putting them into homemade and oatmeal energy bars cannot speak to this brand vs other brands as this is the only brand i have tried i can say that i was pleased enough to stick with this brand for the re order ,great product , great product
these may last forever at t every day in my morning shake since i am having trouble finding recipes for other ways to use these seeds but they will keep in a sealed plastic container ,great price well packaged , great product
this was the first time i tried purchasing a food product over the internet and as i was sent something other than what was pictured br br this package contains chia seed powder which i assume is ground up seed or the remainder from packaging whole seeds that you have no way of whether or not has additional filler br br not going to bother returning a product but just disappointed when the page advertises whole seeds ,not whole chia seeds , not as good as it is
i was surprised by the number of star reviews of this product its a tiny gritty seed that gets stuck in every corner of your mouth and the taste is like nothing kind of like poppy seeds but with out the taste i finally ask myself why am i eating this annoying seed and put it out back in the bird unfortunately they do not seem to like it much either ,for the , not as good as it is
if you love bbq oysters this is the original west coast bbq sauce after years it is nice to be able to buy this outside of ,unique product , best ever

is pretty useful for the am lying in bed without to help keep food down it just won t stay down type of heartburn in fact pair the earth mama tea with sleeping in a and the am burn is no longer one of my concerns br br the taste of the tea is sort of grassy with a bit of mint i do not find it too bitter to drink without a sweetener my best tip for making the tea work well is to start drinking it before the heartburn becomes a problem i usually brew a large cup to have with my dinner then reserve a few worth of the tea to sip during the night when i wake up the taste is fine when the tea is cold and i find it no less effective br br overall i recommend earth mama angel baby organic heartburn tea ,better than nothing , a great tea
i am only weeks pregnant and had the worst case of heartburn indigestion i was sick till my mom found this tea and the first day i drank cups and it my symptoms a bit but continued using it day no heartburn indigestion at all i am on day and still going strong and feeling better than ever thank god for moms and this tea ,it works , great tea
this is a pleasant tea it tastes mostly of chamomile unfortunately for me it does not do too much to heartburn i am now weeks along and have had heartburn almost the whole time and i was hoping this would help out but it really has not had an effect i do like the tea just as a mild beverage but i cannot recommend it for pregnancy related heartburn ,tasty tea help for , not as good as it is
case of heartburn at weeks along and after not being able to eat dinner and it was not getting any better my best friend just bought me the earth mama angel baby tea sampler the other day and i had a moment remembering the heartburn tea was in there i figured it was worth a shot not having eaten dinner and feeling and miserable within a half an hour the tea helped me to let out a couple of good burps and the finally i am not usually so excited about something to go out and write a review but am hoping this might help some other be in need as well i am putting in an order to get some more of this today will be good to have a box on hand at home and at work the taste is very nice too so i am beyond pleased ,fantastic my , great product
we first had these sardines in st and they were the very best sardines i had ever tasted i returned home and lo and behold they had the same sardines at our local market the next time i looked the did not carry them anymore so i looked online and found them through amazon at market somehow they can get these sardines at the store in st but we are unable to get them in the united states my order will expire on march th and i still do not have the sardines but i reordered today through a different supplier at a much greater cost but i hope i receive them this time they are yummy ,wonderful , great taste
you think you are doing something good for your kid when you a little more to get an organic formula sadly that is not the case here this is a formula lots of pain and guaranteed having to take measures to prevent this offering juices water etc is just not a sensible approach br br also the manufacturers use sucrose instead of lactose to save money and they use a lot of it with the same sweetness as country time lemonade similac organic sucrose based formula may also set your child up for future diabetes check the ny times article for more info on this br br bottom line painful constipation in the near term possible diabetes and certainly a sweet tooth in the future no thanks ,no thanks , great product
that is until i came across this ny times article about the sugar they use br br from the article br br parents may be buying similac organic because they believe that organic is healthier but babies may have a reason of their own for similac organic it is significantly sweeter than other formulas it is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar or sucrose which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas br br no health problems in babies have been associated with similac organic but to there are in giving babies cane sugar sucrose can harm tooth faster than other sugars once babies get used to its sweeter taste they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods and some studies suggest that they might leading to rapid weight gain in the first year which is often a of childhood ,read this first , not as good as i eat
our baby is very happy with his similac organic ready to drink formula br he is also very happy with the regular formula in the blue bottle which we feed him when the organic is not available br br he did not really like the formula when we had to mix it from powder br he is ten months old now and he rarely spits up always smiles and is the most content baby anybody has ever seen br br i attribute that to awesome and not to the formula ,our baby is perfect , great product
gave my girls horrible gas i did not realize that the two might be different when we went back to pre mix to try to resolve the gas issue i bough a couple of bottles of the organic to try out i felt like i would rather feed my children organic ingredients over conventional ones if all else was equal i also looked at the similac for gas and fussiness and sugar is the first ingredient um no thanks i felt that the organic milk ingredients were closest to the ingredients in breastmilk what they get out of feedings a day so i was happy when they took to it easily and without gas for the record we have had zero problems with constipation if i have to feed formula which unfortunately i do for some of their feedings i am glad that i have this formula as an option ,excellent formula , great product
i am not a great milk producer and ha e had to supplement my last children with two i made my own with the next i used the powder not that i have my baby i wanted something quick and easy but also organic i have been happy with this so far i do not like using formula but i decided it was better than killing myself with constant and that i did not have enough br price was better than the store i would love to see it on subscribe and save though ,if you have to use formula this is a good choice , great product
time in the morning or evening so this works great for us first we were mixing breast milk and similac advanced and she was doing great then we wanted to go to organic and moved to this when we were doing both breast milk and this we noticed she far less not a bad thing and never than hours now she only drinks this formula and poops a few times a day and is growing great we started her on this at about months a few ounces a day sometimes mixed with breast milk and now she is months old and eating about ounces a day a regular little br br on a side note if you ever tasted breast milk this tastes as close to that as any formula we tried some formulas are so nasty smelling and tasting its a wonder any baby eats them br br cheers ,baby loves and so do we , best i have ever had
they also provide to the scientific research community standards that said i would be less inclined to trust some of the other small makers of formula ie other organic products suggested as better in these reviews especially the small name organic powders all said and done the components in all of the similac products are the highest quality and with advanced scientific and are well researched in published studies i would trust this brand similac over the smaller no names plain and simple keep in mind it is what best suits your baby and with gi all babies will experience some degree of gas and discomfort regardless of the formula or nutritional source even breastmilk it is sad to see people in these reviews as they are neither do your own research and best to avoid those with as well as the reviews and internet that are overly or biased ,good product and quality i will , great product
my children formula after my first child was born i did not produce enough milk and had to supplement we tried all different types of formula from many name brands unfortunately he had adverse reactions to everything we tried including soy products we finally tried organic similac this was by far the most expensive so we started with the powder this stayed down he did not have any reactions hives throwing up etc after a couple of months he began spitting up a little powdery substance guess we did not mix well enough we then tried the similac organic voila perfect no adverse reactions he was happy healthy br br we ve had more children both have also used the organic similac neither of them have had an problem with the formula according to the doctor they are all very healthy children to me that is what is most important ,awesome organic formula , great product
as far as i can tell this is the only organic ready to feed formula on the us market earth best only comes in powder form it is about time it is cheaper on amazon than from the similac online store ,it is about time , great product
i switched from similac advanced to organic when my daughter was month old she is almost months now no problems at all she loves it ,great product , great for
like the bad reviews say the organic formula constipated our daughter however by alternating every other feeding with regular non organic formula the problem was resolved i am a believer that some organic is better than no organic we have used this method for months and our daughter is full happy and growing well br br i would recommend this if you are looking for an organic formula with milk as the first ingredient as opposed to rice in some of the others ,not a problem if , not as good as it is
are a very company and i had a ton of it from the hospital we have used both the powder and ready made and he likes both he got a little constipated at the beginning but has been on it now for months and no problems i read some other reviews about sucrose well sucrose is just sugar and all formula has sugar in it other companies just label it differently and since one is organic it has to contain a pure sugar as far as the hexane goes i did my research all formulas except one only use the hexane method only contains brown rice syrup that has been shown to have high levels of arsenic uh no thanks also similac has been tested and found to have no hexane present in the product overall my baby is healthy and smart so i am very happy with this formula ,love this formula , great product
i love the fact that i can get this to my house with no charge it is so hard to find organic ,very convenient , great product
improvement i wish i could breast feed but i am unable to so for now this seems the best option especially since it was recommended we stick with a ready made formula for the gas problems br ive read a lot of the reviews and took into consideration the information about sucrose i plan on talking to the pediatrician and my for additional information beyond the article written about it especially since that is from i realize the concern and i am doing research on making my own formula so i know exactly whats in it and that its organic but in the mean time baby l eats great with this is healthy and has fewer stomach problems it is middle of the road when it comes to although is one of the more expensive places target has the best price so for now it works and i recommend it ,the best tried so far , great product
i purchased this formula but was worried after reading the comments here that my month old baby would suffer from constipation he did however i really wanted to use organic formula so i added a few teaspoons of to his cereal and within hours problem solved no constipation since and he has been on this formula for about weeks i give him some cereal every days if your baby is not yet on solids you might consider giving him a little apple or pear juice mixed with water this should do the trick also do not let the constipation issue scare you off ,if you are about , great product
them include gmos gmos and synthetic solvents like hexane are not allowed in usda organic products and ingredients br br martek life is already in hundreds of products many of them certified usda organic please demand that the national organic standards board martek and that the usda national organic program inform the company that the illegal approval is and that their gmo hexane extracted life and life sara are no longer allowed in organic products br br but i went to the website and they do not how they make their i have contacted the company to see what they say br br also these are the corporate practices of martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last at br br the best bet is to just avoid the at this time in my opinion b c corporate america cares more about the than your health ,this is not organic still in it , great product
i ordered this on and it did not ship out until three and a half weeks later it is and i still have not received it yet next time i plan to order from a merchant who can it in a reasonable br br as far as the product is concerned i do like that the similac liquid formula in the oz size does not contain bpa i was really upset when i researched and discovered that the single use ready made liquid containers and large powdered containers both contain bpa i would expect more from similac to be bpa free in all of their packaging ,shipping time is long , great product
