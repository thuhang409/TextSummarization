,Text,Summary
10000,my child was exclusively breastfed for months and i gradually introduced similac organic formula to supplement my breastmilk started to dry up she found this was so much easier to eat she gave up on me by months by the time i completely stopped nursing she was so constipated from the formula that i switched she winced and cried and worked so long to just produced a hard ball the size of ping pong ball it was horrible i realized i was the one helping her poo with nursing and then she lost all ability when she went full formula i say switch,horribly constipating
10001,we breastfeed our month old boy but since his bilirubin level was still high doctors recommended to switch to formula for hours we started with similac advance shield plus which we still had from hospital first hours were wonderful in terms of pooping then we decided to switch to similac organic for known reasons but during the first ounce bottle i began to notice that his stool was getting harder and eventually he stopped pooing actually he produced two stone ball like poops and had a hard time for another hours breast milk and similac advance tested similarly sweet but similac organic was much much less sweet i made a research on the internet and i found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation http www drhull com encymaster c constipation infant html br br constipation means infrequent hard stools it does not mean grunting or straining although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement so the first question to ask is is my child really constipated br br next consider why true constipation excessively hard dry stools arises the normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die that is why severe diarrhea is dangerous the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream br br conversely if the fecal material remains in the colon too long the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard it is just that simple br br so constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because br br the colon is naturally sluggish has decreased motility we say br a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces br a combination of the above two factors br there is obstruction of the lower gi tract br o functional neurologic the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation hirschprung disease br o functional anatomic anal rectal positioning does not allow easy evacuation br o mechanical a tumor physically blocks stool passage br br breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated this is because breast milk is such a low residue diet almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used the stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions chiefly mucus and of course a lot of noisy gas but these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation just infrequent stools br br later when breast feeding infants start solids they technically can become constipated but it is unusual in my experience it is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue by then we are really discussing toddlers br br breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often this worries some parents despite reassurances to the contrary some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled go figure they forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very very long time and it will not hurt anything br br when the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go another problem comes to the fore grunting and straining when the baby rectum forms in utero it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months the baby does not pass the meconium fetal stool in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before during or after delivery until the baby is several months old and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass because the baby has weak flabby abdominal musculature that is why his little tummy is so poochy he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm just as mom pushed during delivery and with seemingly equal discomfort hence the grunting and red faced straining br br the other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia or uncoordinated stooling br br the cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple a gentle rectal exam with a well lubricated pinky finger by the doctor which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction will be both diagnostic and curative if one such gentle dilation does not do the trick i have mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure the anal spincter is stretched and pretty soon no more terrible straining br top br br bottle fed infants are a whole nother story infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon the exception to this rule in my mind is the new similac that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk so true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard br br the young infant colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk the residue builds up is dried too much and becomes hard pebbly stool it is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass br br the addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist cereal milk concrete cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad probably because parents do not realise just how much cereal the baby is getting br top br br treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication br br again as with breast fed babies a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders br i use a lot of karo corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation it is my first choice recomendation it almost always works if used properly unfortunately many doctors and nurses do not use it properly get poor results and do not recommend it as often as they should i start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle regardless of size and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going usually the baby can be weaned off the karo pretty soon but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life it is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water the excess corn syrup does not get digested very well the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula the excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol as below prunes apple juice br br before scolding me about the risk of botulism from corn syrup please see br br clinical pediatric emergency medicine volume number september pediatric neurologic potpourri cases to remember br br in the past c botulinum was also found in corn syrup but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula br br for the complete source of statement see olsen sj swerdlow dl risk of infant botulism from corn syrup in reply pediatr infect dis j br br certain fruits and juices for example prunes apple juice apricots are rich in sorbitol a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass they can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation br lactulose is a non absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass we use it a lot it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists the dose is adjusted up or down according to respose side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea obviously stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur br glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just will not come out easily the suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool which softens it the act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex glycerine is completely safe it is a food found in candy not a drug br fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation for dietary reasons babies just do not eat a lot of fiber i believe isoyalac which was a high fiber soy formula has been discontinued it was never very available any place i practiced anyway br br top br br myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation br br iron in the formula causes constipation no way i can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations in large doses they may become constipated but the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems br br the irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low or no iron formulas br br increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool the problem is too little water retention in the stool not too little water in the body unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar karo lactulose to retain the water in the stool excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine br br top,constipation
10002,this is a great product my baby loves it i especially like the smooth liquid formula versus the powder since the powder never seems to dissolve properly br br i am however rating this low because of the seller is ridiculous this product normally sells for but they are jacking up the price because there is a shortage of the liquid formula due to the powder recall br br you should be ashamed amazon this is food for a baby makes me ill,great product but price gouged b c of shortage
10003,do not buy this product you will not be doing your infant any favors if at all possible you should be breastfeeding i know it is not always easy or convenient if you cannot then in my opinion the best formula is earth best and even that is disappointing basically they dry cow milk and remove all the natural nutrients then fortify with synthetic vitamins minerals pathetic just buy whole organic milk raw if possible there are recipes online to make it closer to human breast milk sorry to be so matter of fact i am losing patience for all these evil corporations capitalizing on the green movement oh and by the way the second ingredient in this garbage is sugar good way to start the diabetes obesity while they are young,garbage
10004,i have been searching for a natural lemonade drink mix that would actually taste good this is not one of them did not like the the bitter taste of this drink mix i can make my own fresh squeezed lemonade better than this stuff in the mean time i purchase newmans own ready made lemonade if i do not have the time to make my own lemonade,no thanks
10005,these jelly beans are great for a party activity think harry potter or as a gag gift there are different colors of jelly beans each color could be one of two flavors and you will not know which until you bite into it one flavor is good like peach and the other flavor is disgusting like vomit yes vomit some other gross flavors include pencil shavings skunk smell rotten eggs the worst in my opinion toothpaste great party game for kids my year old friends loved it the only reason i gave it stars instead of is that the bad flavors are so gross that no one wants to eat them and they get spit out so half of the jelly beans go straight into the trash but i guess it is the novelty that makes it fun,fun but gross
10006,the kids had a solid hour of almost constant laughter and fun and the grown ups had fun as well this would be great for a group of children for each color of jelly bean there is one normal flavor and one weird flavor and you cannot tell which one you have gotten until it is too late some of the weird flavors like toothpaste and pencil shavings are simply unusual others such as centipede rotten egg and skunk are truly vile the spinner really helped the kids use this as a game and they loved it and still talk about it,a real winner for the whole family
10007,they are what they claim to be the sweet flavors are sweet and the gross flavors are gross my yr old boys loved these from the easter bunny but i thought the adults that were adventurous enough to try them had even more fun with them you cannot tell what you get by sight or smell not until you bite into them do you know the truth highly recommended if you are into this sort of thing,hillarious reactions
10008,my daughter played this game at school and just loved it she wanted to have it at home to be able to play with her friends and family its a really fun game until you have to eat one of the terrible tasting jellybeans,fun game for the kids
10009,this is the best price that i have found for this entertaining fun filled disgusting game each jelly bean of the same colors have two flavors one as it should be and one that is mostly disgusting if you purchase this sadistic game you should also purchase an additional box of replacement jelly beans sold separately,entertaining at it is most disgusting level
10010,this was purchased as a game for my thirteen year old daughter harry potter themed get together to celebrate the release of the final movie the jelly bean game is loads of hysterical fun and fit very well with our theme,really cool game
10011,this product arrived very fast and perfectly new the kids had so much fun playing the game it is a birthday party they will never forget,beanboozled
10012,got this as a gift for the office it is nice to get people to take a break from work to see what they get unfortunately its not well mixed it is almost gone and so far all the black ones are not the licorice and that is the good flavor compared to the other one ick same goes to the white ones and the there was only one pair of the blue to be played,fun game not enough of each color to really play
10013,i bought a few boxes of these as gifts for my daughter and her family at easter time they were the hit of her household when family and friends came by they all enjoyed spinning and trying out the flavor beans they won awesome fun,great fun for everyone
10014,i got a call from my mother in law last night thanking me for her birthday present i ordered here she thanked me for the surprise and also had to comment how terrible they tasted she asked me if it was supposed to be a joke on her i said no and felt bad a year old lady ate some bad jelly beans br br won t buy again br br steve baker,i feel beanboozled
10015,both dogs love these treats and they have healthy components the only reason i gave instead of stars is that these are made in china and that worries me,my dogs love these made in china which worries me
10016,taste is just ok a bit greasy compare to fat free micro kettle pop corn bags purchases here at better cost coconut flavor is like coconut flakes flavoring br not a good value since you get bags for purchased it because i wondered about it since i love coconut br won t buy again because of the greasy feeling and high cost,ok coconut popcorn
10017,i have tried several of the different flavors of folger this is the best the old stand by it makes a good cup of coffee every time,best of folger
10018,i found this is one of the easiest ways to shop for coffee the subsribe and save program saves you money and you never wake up to an empty can folgers coffee ground classic roast ounce packages pack of is priced well and i prefer the classic roast better than the fancy coffee house brands as another reviewer stated it as the old stand buy br br i love to shop online it is often cheaper and without hassle i could drive to wallet world park and fight the crowds hopefully find my specific brand stand in line and wait for the person ahead to clip their coupons have their cc declined write a check etc or i could login to amazon and click one button then wait two days for my no sales tax free delivered product please do not get me wrong i like to shop at the big box stores when i have time but usually i shop online br trip to grocery store two canisters of coffee plus tax and hassle have is delivered free without tax for without the hassle br br price c br convience a br taste a,the old stand by
10019,folgers is good coffee we order it regularly prefer the mild medium flavors coffee is always fresh tasting good to the last cup even after setting for a time it does not taste bitter get many cups of coffee from this size,great coffee
10020,i think folgers is an excellent coffee choice i have been drinking it ever since i have been drinking coffee about years it is good at the beginning of the pot and just as good at the end of the pot,coffee review
10021,i use this coffee with my toddy cold press system and it makes a very smooth cup of coffee i so far have only used folgers coffee with the system and see no reason to change as the end result is so very good,good coffee
10022,i sent this to some friends who helped me out when i had surgery it came and was beautiful all of the items were really good and shipping was fast very pleased,wonderful
10023,this ediable image is easy for anyone to use my man is into bass fishing so this was the perfect cake decor he loved it,easy
10024,excellent product this is the first time my seven year old has had an ice cream cone in three years when i brought them home i thought she was going to jump out of her skin after she had her cone she asked for more and even upon receiving a no she still had the biggest smile on her face,excellent
10025,be careful if you have a chocolate allergy the last box i purchased has cocoa powder as the ingredient and the cones are brown i know previous boxes did not contain cocoa powder and were a normal cone color the distributor should market these as chocolate cones and not try to pass them off as something else note be especially leary since this seller does not list ingredients,do not buy if you are allergic to chocolate
10026,we have two large dogs whose urine yellows our lawn we give them the recommended dosage with their dinner and it has significantly stopped the yellowing of the grass good call br br bottom line buy it,works great
10027,nutritional benefits of chia seeds are amazing here are a few to start br br according to studies chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids linolenic and linoleic of all crops chia seeds contain omega fatty acids br br the protein content of chia is higher that other nutritional grains unlike other grains it is a complete protein meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids about to of chia seeds weight is protein br br chia seeds are high in fiber a gm serving of chia seeds will provide to gm of fiber our body requires at least gm of fiber a day to stay healthy br br chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health br br chia seeds are rich in calcium about oz of chia seeds contains mg of calcium as compared to mg for a cup of milk br br chia seeds have times more potassium than banana br br chia seeds have times more antioxidants than blueberries br br regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of chia it also tastes very good my girlfriend and i make a big pot of steel cut oatmeal at night the quick way is throw a cup of oats in cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight put in a good helping of chia powder and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it feel free to add a little cinnamon peanut butter fruit or your own oatmeal favorite additions br br there are many other recipes for eating chia but oatmeal is my personal favorite i started eating chia last year after reading the ny times bestseller born to run about how a tribe of mexicans that eat chia will drink beer smoke tobacco and then run up to miles in a footrace the following days one of the primary contributors to the tribal mexicans seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient rich chia seeds i have not put in miles but after previously failing to finish a mile marathon without chia in my diet i added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first mile marathon could the chia have helped i think so i certainly had more energy and my joints felt better my second attempt at a marathon when on the chia br br i started out paying an arm and a leg at whole foods for chia powder but have since started buying them on amazon for a fraction of the price my suggestion is to get some chia and make a delicious bowl of oatmeal for one of the healthiest breakfasts possible,superfood
10028,although i eat a ton of fruits veg i have to admit i was looking for a quickie fiber boost and i wanted to avoid psyllium because of the phytic acid properties that block absorption of certain medications and supplements i take many of the latter br br sprouting reduces phytic acid and is recommended by many in the nutrition communities for safely preparing oatmeal barley etc br br so i got the sprouted navitas brand chia powder shown here but at whole foods i have to say this stuff is terrific i put tbs serving in about cup of warm filtered water and stirred it and watched as it kind of puffed up tasted it and you know what it kind of tasted like oatmeal or barley i intended to add this slurry into my green smoothie but i liked the way it tasted so much i just ate it with a spoon br br my recommendation is to add a little warm water to the powder and stir it up before mixing it into whatever you are eating or just eat it straight as i did br br i m going to buy this brand in bulk at amazon and i will make sure it is the sprouted powder and not the seeds br br by the way i read on a review posted about the navitas chia seeds that they make a kind of tapioca by adding coconut or almond milk and stevia to the chia seeds so i tried doing that with the powder it created a kind of soft puffy pudding texture and it was definitely in the treat category,this stuff tastes pretty good
10029,i have had persistently high cholesterol for years allergic to statins zetia made me sick nothing pharma came up with worked for me i am a workout fiend and half vegetarian my total cholesterol was always or higher after one month of chia powder it was at nearly miraculous,chia great for cholesteroal
10030,i ordered and got seeds called got a refund and reordered got seeds i will have to order the sprouted chia seed powder elsewhere,not what is in the bag
10031,gave it to my daughter who uses it in recipes but i wanted to use it in smoothies it tasted to bad to me,tasted yuk
10032,ugh this stuff may be good for me but it is not appealing i mixed it in my oatmeal for a while and it was fine that way but sticky but i did not notice any obvious effect and i have slacked off,tough to take
10033,this is a good miso base i make true miso soup by adding nori seaweed cutup scallions tofu etc i almost did not buy it based on the poor review on a similar product but i am glad i did it is tasty,good miso
10034,this is a very good value i use it to put in many asian recipes instead of chicken or vegetable broth the result is a more authentic asian taste to my recipes,good product
10035,i love this product very convient serving packages and only needs some ginger and cayenne for healthful benefits miso ginger helps with clogged arteries good general tonic besides being a very yummy cup a soup,quick easy
10036,we love miso cup soup we use it to flavor our ramen it is much healthier and tastier than the usual salt and msg the price on amazon is great too less than half the price we were paying in a local health food store thanks amazon,healthy flavoring alternative
10037,i like japanese soups and just love the similar products from san j also available from amazon get those they are star br br this miso cup brand is terrible i cannot tell you more than this is just yicky i wish there was a zero star rating br br i did not finish the first cup even but i would already tried and re tried another miso cup flavor and hated it therefore i only used one envelope before giving away the rest oh why did i stray from san j actually i thought it might be worth trying miso cup different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience it was this flavor in particular that i was most interested in trying for variety but now i know that all the miso cup brand are equally dreadful br br i gave these and the other miso cup boxes to a food pantry but i told them first why to warn others it might not suit them get the san j brand,do not buy dreadful
10038,i did not enjoy this soup i will try a different brand next time,bad soup
10039,this coffee is smooth and is not bitter at all it is wonderfully aromatic and a rich flavor i personally bought the beans in jamaica but it was only for ounces i have seen such inflated prices on the internet for this product and truly it is not worth it,jablum coffee beans
10040,there is a reason they serve this coffee at the white house its the smoothest best coffee ever produced low acid smooth in the mouth and it has the most intoxicating aroma worth the price,the best coffee ever
10041,i was very disappointed with the quality of the coffee i have purchased blue mountain coffee before from other places and it was always great but this was totally unsatisfactory it had a mildewed flavor to it like it had been stored for a long time in a warehouse that was damp or moldy for the money i paid for it i was quite displeased and will never buy from them again,disappointed
10042,my son had this jablum roasted and ground coffee brought back from jamaica and paid a lot for it i have drunk blue mountain for years when i can but this was shocking it tasted stale when you opened the bag and even worse when you drank it it was definitely off he bought bags and every one we tried was the same i would never buy another we had bought another brand in a tin from jamaica which was fine i think this is a con you get all the rubbish about it being tested in jamaica well i dont know who tests it but definitely not someone who likes good coffee i just dont understand how people say its any good maybe having paid so much for it its like the emperor new clothes,jablum dont buy it
10043,we heard about this coffee before leaving for jamaica so we pick up some and have fell in love with it the best we have had yet smooth without that bitter after taste so many other coffee have,the best we has yet
10044,i love my coffee and because of that i have tried lots and lots of varieties although i began as a simple folgers fantatic jamaican mountain blue coffee has been touted to be the best of the best world coffees out there by such highly esteemed sources as the food network and the kitchens of the white house br br i found the low acidity of the coffee very refreshing but the darkness of this roast has not allowed a lot of subtleness of the flavor to come out to me this tastes like folgers at its best but nothing more than that great for everyday drinking because it is smooth and rich and leaves little acid bite but still after having tried kona coffee with its myriad of subtle flavors i found blue mountain kinda boring br br i guess i disagree with experts but hey my coffee is important and taste is everything if you like exotic flavors this is not it but it you would like to have consistently smooth rich honest coffee this is the one,excellent coffee not all that exotic though
10045,i am a coffee lover of many years and as such am always interested in finding good coffees this was my first time to try blue mountain and purchasing it with a gift certificate allowed me to be a bit more extravagant than i otherwise would have been br br while the coffee is good i do not find it to be superior to other coffees i have ordered which are considerably less expensive,blue mountain experience
10046,these are some of my favorite beans i have purchased this brand a number of times in various roasts and i have never been disappointed whether you use them in your french press your espresso maker or your conventional coffee pot some of the best tasting coffee you can imaging comes out of this bag br br definitely recommended,my favorite beans
10047,while in jamaica my wife and i drank blue mountain coffer every day and loved it we even went on a bike tour of the blue mountains and purchased some coffee it came in a plain clear plastic bag and we could see the darkness of the roast we enjoyed that coffee br br in ocho rios we bought some bags of jablum you cannot see the darkness of the roast and all you can smell is the burlap bag when we opened it up it was a very light roast not much fragrance and once brewed the coffee tasted a lot like dirt we were very disappointed,love blue mountain coffee hate jablum
10048,i bought this coffee in jamaica for lb bag while i liked and enjoyed it i prefer several coffees from my local shops at about the same price i think that it may have been worth the lb but no more certainly not at these prices,good coffee but not great
10049,i recently ordered the oz pack when my fedex order arrived on december there were only two oz bags contained in my order i would like my missing oz bag to be sent to me or at least be refunded of my charged price,only of oz received in shipment
10050,went to jamaica last may and brought about pounds of this and the waldenford blue mtn back with me about half what you are paying here but still not worth the money it is good coffee no question but do not believe all the hype i am a casual coffee drinker and someone that takes coffee more seriously might get more benefit from this coffee to me not the case i order my peet arabian mocha java online for about lb and it is still my favorite coffee,do not believe the hype
10051,i do not get all the hype over this coffee not much of a head on it does not taste that great what is the big whoop,p u
10052,i love this stuff it tastes like ice cream just not cold seriously if you have not tried this you have to,the greatest stuff ever
10053,not what i expected at all there is no punch to these chips like i thought there would be not spicy or hot but rather just disgusting the flavor is off and the after taste is god awful i ate one corn chip and decided i did not care for them so i ate something else to get the flavor of poop out of my mouth because that is what these chips taste like and i can still taste these poo chips i will not be buying these chips again at all there blue corn chips are really great but the so called red powder they put on these is just so off,garden of eatin red hot blues
10054,you watch your mouth br br simply one of the best things i have ever eaten healthy organic blue corn chips with taste that packs a punch br br i will not waste your time reading about these when you can be enjoying them instead just note that some bags seem to have a more generous allotment of cayenne pepper the special ingredient that distinguishes red hot blues from the standard blue chips or perhaps certain bags settle more during shipment in which case the bulk of the cayenne dust is to be found at the bottom of the bag you can always scoop up the loose seasoning and sprinkle on the chips or any food lol as you see fit br br p s amazon needs to figure out how to share reviews across products in this case for example there are at least four different listings for red hot blues the only difference is the size of the bag or the quantity of bags that are bundled together i am posting this review in those as well because other than one listing none of the others have any reviews hopefully this will be of some help to customers plus point them toward the main listing the one with free shipping and sold directly from amazon br br a href http www amazon com gp product b eqyw e garden of eatin tortilla chips red hot blues ounce bags pack of a,those red hot blues are one bad mutha
10055,kinda expensive for cheese product would expect ssomething closer to the per pound price i can get in the supermarket but it is so versatile can be used in any recipe that calls for cheese br br my favorite use is to super cheese both store brand and even kraft boxed mac n cheese sometimes that little packet of cheese powder just does not give me the cheese i ness i want so after mixing the mac n cheese according to the directions on the box i put a few slices of velveeta on top nuke it for a few minutes mix it in and viola try it you will never want to eat mac n cheese out of the box again,a bit pricey but so versatile
10056,great chesse to make snacks with melts so easy and has a wonderful flavor this is the ultimate in american comfort cheese,the american comfort cheese
10057,i spent close to for each cube which turned out to be the oz size i know it says that upon further review but i was assuming it was the lb size because that size is at the grocery and i just paid the same thing for the lb size shame on you amazon or better yet shame on me the expiration date is fast approaching too so i am not even sure i will use these up in a month i was very disappointed in the price as well as the expiration date i had the same issue with some sunflower seeds i bought recently they expired before baseball season even started however i did get what i paid for it just my mistake for not realizing the size was not what i thought i was getting who would pay that for the lb size,way over priced for the size
10058,i am giving these two stars because they did taste sorta good at first but like the other reviewer said they do smell funny and they left a bad taste in my mouth and they are very salty i only cooked them for seconds the bag was still expanding when i stopped it but they smelled burnt when they were done they said to cook until it stopped expanding but thank goodness i did not do that nice idea but i do not think i will buy these again,thought it was a good idea
10059,i loved this item i wish i could find it in the stores walmart carried this item in louisiana for some time when i travel to louisiana i sometime can find this item at fred i have not found this item in the houston area easy to prepare and a great conversation piece no one here has seen this before i purchased this item at amazon,ms mac review
10060,our wal mart use to sell these pork rinds but they have not for probably years i hunted all over the place for them until i finally found them my husband loves them he works so hard i figured i would get him something he loves,lowery microwave pork rinds
10061,i love both orignal and spicy flavored great any time during day or night fresh and warm a treat that is usually only available cold and with two flavor choices,great crunch best taste even better when hot
10062,very good if you want to be on a paleolithic diet very tasty when warm cooks great a great fast snack,very good
10063,when i read the reviews i noticed someone mentioned the box was light it is but it holds a lot these pork rinds are compact they expand when cooked so there is a lot more in the box than it looks like br br as snacks go these are high in protein and low in carbohydrate br br i think this is a really good value and these are very flavorful i especially enjoy them with bean dip br br the only thing that i would change is i would like a lightly salted version i do not always want that much salt,tasty good value
10064,eating my first bag as i type awesome some puffed up to be light and puffy others did not puff up as much and are much more crunchy which i like might be the best pork rinds i have had outside of central america street carts,let us be serious
10065,great product i never cook this in the microwave because sometimes it takes longer and not all microwaves are the same i have read people reviews and they said there were small brown pieces that were hard that means they were not cooked long enough the best way to cook these are to use a medium size pan pour the pack into the pan and shake it around and bake them in the oven degrees for minutes keep a close eye on them because they burn easy but it is worth it to cook it in the oven very hot and fresh and no uncooked curls they will appear to be brown at first but they poof up in the oven once they are heated i would say do not microwave these in a bag use a oven safe plate that way you can actually see them puff up older cheap microwaves can take minutes to cook,great
10066,these are so much better than the pre packaged ones not too many calories i cook mine for min and seconds in a very small microwave,so good
10067,i live in the kansas city area and could not find them anywhere i had bought them before at the commissory in leavenworth but could not find them here someone recommended checking amazon com and i was thrilled to find them there they are easy to fix and if you like pork rinds you will not go back to the bagged ones,lowrey pork rinds
10068,tasty spicy and good became quite the conversation piece at work no one have ever heard of microwave pork rinds before they tasted them and love them only draw back depending on type of microwave as to how they will cook,tasty
10069,i was so excited to receive the product i immediately cooked a bag what a disappointment the taste of the pork skins was there but it was buried by some spice that i did not enjoy i could not finish the bag my dog would not eat them either ans she eats everything including brusell sprouts i have had microwave pork skins that were good but i do not remember the brand so i will just have to do without,microwave pork skins
10070,these were a great quick snack that did not raise my blood sugar level and you could sprinkle a variety of seasons to your taste preferences however i chose to use the auto ship because of new health issues i am unable to eat these anymore however because lowrey does not give you any option or information on how to cancel an order i am forced to waste money buying these and having to toss them i hate to write this here but maybe if they read it they will add the contact information thank you,lowrey microwavable pork rinds
10071,i absolutely love these a friend had found them in a random store down in oklahoma a long time ago and i thought they were awesome but as i do not live in oklahoma and cannot find these anywhere in the mn area amazon having them is awesome they are low carb and taste pretty great,nom
10072,we own a small neighborhood bar and the patrons enjoy having the novelty of fresh hot pork rinds served to them with their beverages,micro pork rinds
10073,it was quite a commitment for me to buy this quantity of pork rinds from amazon but i decided that i would give it a go since i like the pork rinds that are sold in grocery stores and i figured that these could only be better since they would be fresher when microwaved they taste great and i think that they have the perfect amout of spice however two things the smell is funky when they come out of the microwave regardless of the taste i cannot seem to get used to the smell secondly when it comes to popcorn i have to pop popcorn less than the directions on the package in my microwave or it will burn i found it to be the opposite with these pork rinds i had to cook the port rinds longer than the directions say on the package otherwise they would not be popped nicely and were a bit chewy so if you find that you cook these and they do not seem crispy enough cook them in your microwave longer than the directions say to do so,pretty good but i am not sure that i will buy again
10074,these are the best pork rinds around near and far they are warm and just melt in your mouth this is a dangerous addiction you have been warned,best ever
10075,awesome i love em cracklin out of the microwave this snack is also not nearly as bad for you as chips or other snack,spicey pork rinds
10076,i was never a big fan of pork rinds but since i started doing atkins i was buying them sometimes to fill that desire for a crunchy salty snack i ended up only buying the hot variety since it seemed to cover the taste of the rinds better than plain or bbq after reading the reviews here decided to give these a try br br i had never had anything other than the bagged variety of pork rinds as others have mentioned here these are far superior to anything you will find in a bag way way better than any bagged variety i have sampled plus the make this great popping crackling noise when you take them out for a minute or so that i greatly enjoy for some reason br br do mind the cooking instructions if you overcook they will end up tasting closer to the bagged taste you are trying to avoid still better than bagged though i tried different times in my microwave but found it best to watch and take them out as soon as the bag stops rising you will sometimes have some that did not expand you can pop these back in the microwave to try and revive them but it is not worth burning some of them to try to ensure all have expanded,great item
10077,why am i just learning about these they are delicious br br enough in each individual bag for people to share br br low cal low fat but not low flavor highly recommend br br will be back for more,yum
10078,i am on a low carb diet so pork rinds were a natural i bought the hot and spicy these are great they taste better than any others that i have tried from the stores the package says less than a carb per serving there are servings per ounce package i would like to know how many carbs for a full package because i often eat more than one serving give these a try they are awesome,simply awesome
10079,these are magical put them in the microwave and they literally pop into a fresh hot crackly bag of pork rinds they are a little on the salty side but no more so than most of the pork rinds you buy in the store each bag fills up a large cereal bowl good for a little snack when you need it and you do not want popcorn,pork rind magic
10080,i was so excited to see these and the price is good br br first it takes a little learning to figure out how to cook these the instructions are not much help stop cooking when the bag stops expanding they might as well say perform a vulcan mind meld with the pork rinds to know when they are done i found that the bag expansion or not has little to do with whether they are done i have a watt microwave and was perfect and they were not cooked and i had charcoal bits br i had to sacrifice a couple of precious bags to figure this out br br taste and texture well they are infinitely better than bags of pork rinds from the store the texture is very good the taste i am in no way shy of salty food love me some salt but these were borderline too much for me i did sprinkle some cinnamon and ideal on them to make them sweet and i still had a hard time eating them my husband liked them this way though br br if they could back off the strong salty flavor i would buy these again as it is i am going to use them to make low carb nachos i will not be reordering them though love the crispy texture but cannot choke down the overpowering saltiness,a for freshness but d mn are they salty
10081,i love these bacon curls or pork rinds as some call them i was so happy to find them again easy delicious and high protein snack i eat them every night watchng tv never had a bag that did not perform well love them,love the bacon curl
10082,taste is not like other pork rinds but does not taste bad when you microwave them the bag only pops up about half way when its done popping and you eat them immediately they are pretty hot and seem to melt in your mouth needing much water and a brushing to get the rinds and the taste out of your mouth afterwards i think the idea is pretty good but the product did not turn out how they expected in my opinion,good if its all you can get
10083,my husband loves pork rinds a little too much the perfect fathers day gift was a case of lowerys pork rinds,delicious
10084,outstanding snack super fast and lives up to the review i saw on the food network just make sure you shake the pkg really good before microwaving all in all super,best snack ever
10085,cannot find this product anywhere except on line i guess no one enjoys them as we do same kind of hicks that do not like boiled peanuts i guess anyway product is wonderful and was shipped promptly hope to continue buying from this seller,love those rinds
10086,really easy to prepare and very yummy with my microwave i put them in for and they turn out perfect warm crunchy and tasty and without the carbs they do not impact your blood sugar which is a real boon for us diabetics,tasty easy no carb snack
10087,these are an okay snack they do not puff up like the pork rinds i have had in the past the quantity of rinds in the bag seems lacking there is a unusual taste as if some type of seasoning added that i cannot figure out if you want a salty snack with no carbs they are okay i however will not buy them again i will stick with the regular puffed up ones or cracklings these do not fit in either category quite the way i expected,not quite what i expected
10088,i saw these in a bar in wyoming somewhere my buddy loves the hotnspicy pork rinds and when i saw these microwavable ones i had them sent as a joke however he said they were great and tasted just like the ones in a bag nice,pork rinds
10089,i have had pork rinds in the bag and all and they were usually stale with no flavor since these are cooked fresh they come out nice and warm they have a slight bacon flavor and are not greasy like potato chips are a little salty but very good i cannot find them in any of the stores here either so i am happy amazon has t hem,i love them
10090,a href http www amazon com gp product b up qq lowrey bacon curls microwave pork rinds hot spicy ounce packages pack of a in order to appreciate the taste of a fresh pork rind head to a meat market that has them there is no comparison to that rind with the traditional store version bagged lowrey microwave pork rinds came along and created the perfect answer and a new experience for true pork rind fans usually each bag will create to large pieces and some smaller bites the best way to eat them is immediately after removing them from the microwave when they are hot and chewy cook times vary min sec for me airtight package when it arrives and is not too spicy for those non chili eaters they were sold in stores up until years ago and may still but amazon is the only place i know that has them when you want them every bag is seal wrapped and can be stored like popcorn so no need to keep the box if anything the novelty of this product will break the ice of any party or gathering enjoy,love at first bite
10091,few things are as enjoyable in life as freshly popped pork rinds modern technology has enabled us to produce the epitome of snack foods in a hot fresh version i will be relegated no more to the listless depths of popped corn pork rinds are the ultimate man chips very similar to microwaved popcorn you just shake the bag and put em in your microwave for about min and voila hot fresh pork rinds when you pop them you have to get accustomed to the fact that they do not pop like popcorn they just crackle a bit so it is a bit hard to tell when they are done and usually through trial and error you will get the perfect time depending upon the type of microwave oven you use mine is w and takes just under min a couple of pieces will get burnt or as i affectionately refer to as char the bag will inflate slightly when they are done you open it up and you are greeted with an aroma that is bacon heaven put one in your mouth right away and it will stick to your tongue like a live octopus they are a bit salty so they make the perfect accompaniment to a nice cold beer i did not find them too spicy just enough if you want to be creative you can throw em in a bowl right after they are done popping and throw some salsa verde or any other kind of salsa you have you will be greeted with a chorus of wonderful snaps like getting sizzling rice soup at a chinese restaurant throw on some shredded cheese and the result is man nachos my wife thinks that it is utterly disgusting even though that has not stopped her from eating them trust me they are delicious but do not let em sit too long or they get soggy,snap crackle and pop of pork rinds
10092,my husband loves these so much he never wants to run out i have always thought pork rinds are disgusting but when he pops a bag in the microwave the smell and the sizzling and the warmth and the crunch i have to admit they are really good,sizzling good
10093,these chicharrones are delicious and the packaging is very convenient just like microwave popcorn the pork rinds come in a bag with cellophane around it you shake the bag to distribute the pork rinds pop it in the microwave and set the cooking time br br the optimal time for my microwave is one minute seconds but the time will likely differ from one microwave to another br br the only reason i am not giving this product five starts is due to the msg listed as an ingredient while i do not react badly to msg it still makes me a little nervous br br if you are on a low carb diet this is a great choice for snacking or even meal replacement,practical and delicious however has preservatives
10094,lowrey bacon curls microwave pork rinds hot spicy are the best thing since microwave pop corn especially for diabetics carbs pop one in the microwave and vanquish that craving for a crunchy snack,bacon curls
10095,these r great only problem is easy to burn needs close attention while cooking follow the directions i only needed to cook these for one minute in my microwave,great
10096,i am doing the atkins program for weight loss and i was missing crunchy crispy things celery just does not get it our local stores do not regularly carry pork rinds so i was feeling a little bit left out br br but the lowry brand is one i am familiar with and so i was pretty confident i would like them they do not pop like popcorn in fact they do not make much noise at all when they are cooking i have found that one minute forty eight seconds seems to be the best time to get the most edible rinds but one can also reheat the unpopped rinds and a lot of them will then puff up br br enjoy they are worth it,pleased and satisfied
10097,i was sceptical at first but after i tried the first bag i was hooked very easy to prepare i microwave these for a minute and a half and they come out perfect nice and salty fresher than the ones you get in bags at the store the hardest part is waiting for them to cool,love these
10098,the microwave pork rinds are a new product to me but they are awesome buying a carton of them br br was a good deal and they have far less fat and carbs than chips,the chips are down
10099,love the taste has a good flavor and very crunchy different then your normal pork rinds yummy br i would definately buy again great buy also,crunchy
10100,wonderful two mins in the microwave and i have a crispy hot snack to have with salsa and gucamole great for low carbers or those who want to avoid chips less than carbs for the entire bag the non flavored ones are also very good but i like the spicy kick to these,wonderful for that low carb crunch
10101,a terrible product we follow the intructions and did not get the the pork rinds we only got pieces of pork skin,microwave pork rinds
10102,i finally tried these noodles and cooked them in chicken broth and added to my stir fry everyone liked them and commented that it was like eating ramen noodles once i got past the fishy smell rinsing them i was happy with the result,great for low carb life style
10103,i discovered you can use ketchup or any other condiment bbq sauce mayo mustard etc for a great alternative to french fries,great low fat substitute for french fries
10104,the convience of micorwave popcorn carb and lightly salty well seasoned goodness if you never have eaten fresh pork skins these are a must,warm fresh crunchiness
10105,these are so addicting that i have suscribed to them cannot get these at the grocery stores around here it is a hit for movies parties or just even a snack give it a try,mmmmmm good
10106,i did not find the smell to be anything but inviting warm pork rinds is a concept that was new to me i found the taste to be very good i had no problems with the cook time and the bag did not collapse on the product my only complaint is that there was just too much salt,very good taste but too much salt
10107,unlike microwave popcorn you cannot hear the pork skins cooking so only by trial and error and the wattage of your microwave will you know how long to cook these cooked to the proper timing they will be fluffy melt in you mouth seconds too long you will have a stinky unedible product br it is something that you must try i cooked mine for minute seconds and they were not all done i do not know the wattage of my microwave br so try them for your self as i said they are different than popcorn but have the same results if left too long in the micowave stinky,totally wonderful if not overcooked
10108,but the taste got sickening quite fast it also makes a really weird stench smell when you are microwaving it sometimes it would hurt my tongue when i am eating it all in all i threw the rest of them away after my rd bag it might just be me but i cannot say i would let the guests of my home try these so i cannot recommend them here to anyone,tasted good the first few bags
10109,i like spicy snacks and this product fills the bill nicely i will not buy another bag from the store after tasting these a minute twenty seconds in the microwave and they are done when my stash gets low i will be buying more,snacks
10110,this is a great alternative to microwave popcorn this is a quick and easy snack it is got a great spicy flavor,love these
10111,takes at least three minutes in my micro and some are singed while some are still old maids good flavor but just a little salty for me i do not recommend,not what i was hoping for
10112,too salty but that was not even the worst of the problems it has a weird texture i cooked it perfectly and tastes horrible if you have not eaten pork rinds before please stay away even the worst popcorn tastes better,disgusting
10113,i love reading reviews about the smell have you really though this through we are taking pork rind pellets and microwaving them till they expand it is frankly amazing they do not smell worse beyond the smell of cooking rind which i do not mind by the way these snacks are great it took us a two bags to figure out the cook time to little and you do not get full expansion to much and they get hard i mean real hard for us it is minute seconds to perfection every time i really like the seasoning as well i do not find it offensively over board or chemically basically it is a simple snack,not bacon but still a great snack
10114,lowrey bacon curls microwave pork rinds hot spicy ounce packages pack of br pork rinds are great with beer love it,great with beer
10115,calling these bacon curls is a bit of a stretch but they are in fact tasty pork rinds i am fairly certain only bacon can be bacon,not to shabby
10116,i ordered the pork rinds as a christmas gift for my father in law he is one who has everything and if you buy him anything he will put it up then i ordered some for my husband needless to say i took some to work with me we all have fallen in love with them during this time i have contacted the grocery store and they have now put them in their store for everyone to purchase and enjoy,pork rinds
10117,these taste great and if you do not cook them all the way the tiny bits of pork rinds stay crunchy and hard which i love br it very reminiscent of porchetta skin br br i keep a case of these at work and one at home that way i have a quick snack at the office and a nice substitute for popcorn at home honestly these taste better than any popcorn i have ever had if you are on a ketogenic diet these are a must have,perfect when you want a low carb snack
10118,for anyone who likes pork rinds and a decent spicy flavor these are the way to go br super easy to cook in the microwave and less cost than buying regular ones br great taste easy and not bad on carbs and fat as well,great snacks
10119,these microwave pork rinds are absolutely the best available any bag of pork rinds you buy in a store are not as good the only place i have seen their equal is the ones that are cooked fresh at fall festivals and such places they are excellent do not overcook them or they will burn and be lousy if done properly they are the best,best pork rinds available
10120,i have not had pork rinds in more than years and thought that this would be fun to try but i didn nt have high expectations microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success however i had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn well it does i do not have much with which to compare the taste years ago however the texture and crispiness is just as i remembered i like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted these are not especially spicy but i used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job br br it is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave i have also found that mins seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds br br i have eaten bags of the pork rinds and i love them they are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn and each bag is only carb,the microwave pork rinds are surpisingly fantastic
10121,i own a bar and this product along with the regular rinds is a very good seller keeps customer at the bar for snacks plus puts something in their stomach for the liquor,good seller
10122,i got these for my low carb diet i plan to eat them with tuna salad and or guacamole i cooked some last night just to see how it works they were pretty good plain but i am looking forward to trying them with dip,way better than pre cooked kind
10123,these pork rinds are the ticket delicious br once you master eye balling the rise of the bag and when to stop those microwaves you will be soooo delighted br all the rind pieces have been puffing up nicely for me and when dipped in blue cheese dressing with tabasco sauce oh that is part of the good life guys br order arrived in great shape flawless transaction will be back for more,low carb treat
10124,these are great just like pork rinds out of the bag but fresh and hot whenever you want them beware they really are hot and spicy but i love the heat make sure to read and follow the directions before microwaving,great
10125,okay first of all i accidentally ordered two boxes of these so i am now the proud owner of way more pork rinds than anyone should have in the house luckily they are pretty darned delicious i microwaved mine for almost two minutes because my microwave is not the most powerful machine out there and what resulted were hot crispy puffy pork rinds that taste like they should be way worse for you than they are i mean they are not great for you but come on they are pork rinds they are quite salty but i am a salt fanatic so that is a okay in my book anyway i recommend just do not order two boxes or you will be stuck wondering if microwave pork rinds are an acceptable christmas gift,i love salt so i love these
10126,amazon we ll be back my daughter and i just started a very low carb diet and were searching for a snack the lowrey micro pork rinds really fit the bill we both enjoy this snack and our diet loves it too,great snack product from amazon

10128,i am diabetic and manage my weight and blood sugar levels medicine free with a low carb diet they do not sell these anywhere i have seen locally but in the south i would think they would be a hit they are a good product and blow away any already prepared pork rinds and if you are on a low carb diet it is really hard to find a crunchy snack and these fit the bill they are flavorful and tender yet crisp thumbs up,pork rinds
10129,i have a g e watt microwave i cooked bags before i got it right if you like them soft and light puffy not hard and crunchy try min secs no hard pebbles just light fluffy and totally what you want full power minutes and you will thank me,too good to be true

10136,i have not been able to find these in any grocery stores in montana they are a great late afternoon snack with just the right amount of kick if you follow the directions on the package they really do puff up nice,snacks

10139,my husband has been looking for this product in the store and it is nowhere to be found he is a happy camper,found them
10140,yummy they are still crackling when you take them from the bag fresh and delicious high in protein be sure not to overcook them,i could not find these anywhere else
10141,i have been low carb dieting and i like pork rinds so i could not wait to try these they are not really spicy they are more like mild in my opinion they are good they taste just like the pork rinds that you buy at the store not bacon y at all to me the only downside is that your house will smell like hot pork rinds it is pretty bad i do not normally notice things like that but it is pretty smelly and hard to get rid of,delicious for adkins dieters
10142,my husband i discovered this item while shopping a while back and fell in love with them they are so fresh when you take them out of the microwave we like the spices on them you just have to remember to take them out of the microwave as soon as the bag rises,pork rinds
10143,these pork rinds from lowery are a quick snack but very easy to over cook i like the spicy and wife likes the plain hard to find in stores so i order from amazon com,quick snack
10144,i bought these years ago at walmart br and then they stopped carrying them i was searching the internet and found them at amazon we ordered a box of each i like the spicy and my husband likes the orginal a learning process will be a sure thing until you figure out how many minutes for your microwave they are great and we love them,great taste
10145,i have tried every kind of pork rinds on the market and lowrey microwave pork rinds are the best i have ever had i have given friends some to try and they totally agree with me the only problem is that they are hard to find that is why i ordered a case from amazon,awesome
10146,i used to get this product at walmart but in there great wisdom they stopped carrying it i love this product as it is light easy on the diet,best product
10147,was really dissappointed in product too salty and poor flavor convenience is what makes product worth purchasing if you like pork rinds,dissappointment
10148,lowrey has changed it is microwave pork rinds i used to love them the last order i received was put up in a generic paper container with really flimsy cellophane wrapping there is no writing on the paper sack whatsoever the taste is sub par as is the amount of rinds as i said i used to love the product i will buy no more lowrey microwave pork rinds,lowrey changed their product
10149,so they lose a star because i think they smell like the devil and taste similar not like pork rinds i enjoy the seasoning salt they add is not my thing i cant quite pin it down br br but my wife enjoys them so they get a good review,wife likes them i do not
10150,giving the other bags of these to the local food shelf just seems too cruel better to throw them away br br i do not know what good the popping does except make them sort of hot they are too salty have a hideous flavor taste nothing like pork rinds they do not even taste as good as bad pork rinds they are also loaded with chemicals i want to avoid probably part of the source of the hideous flavor,ghastly
10151,these are so good especially when they are still hot i love the way they still sizzle and pop while eating sometimes i sprinkle some hot sauce on mine straight from the microwave or a little parmesan cheese depending on my mood however i eat them they are really good remember to shake them well for a minute or two before nuking them the bags do not puff up as much as microwave popcorn so do not expect them to only cook for the suggested time on the bag,yummmy
10152,i have ordered about boxes to date i have only had a few times that they seemed salty i think the shaking of the bag helps much on this you also have to watch your own microwave as to the time needed to cook do not over cook them or they will burn and become hard i like to dip in vineger as well after cooking you hear the snap crackle pop some like hot sauce on it too br i found these in a food store the first time and i bought them as a joke but after the first bag i was hooked i am glad amazon has them because i can not find any local stores that sell them anymore br i myself prefer the original flavor but this is more of a personal taste then anything else many of my friends liked the spicy you have to love the warm rinds,best thing since sliced bread
10153,my husband and i love these they taste soo good fresh from the microwave i was pleased to see these as a pack of i can only find packs at my local grocery store and they are not as economical,yummy
10154,what an awesome snack super easy to make and does not disappoint whatsoever the flavor is totally there they come out perfectly hot crispy light and stays fresh throughout the week if you are in the mood for something salty its the ideal snack love these they are addictive,brilliant snack
10155,if you enjoy pork rinds you are going to love this product hot and fresh pork rinds beat the socks off any of that bagged stuff from the grocery store that taste like steyrofoam packing peanuts these little gems cook up light and crispy right from the microwave they have a mildly spicy flavor that builds up as you make way through the serving but the heat never gets too powerful the key to getting the best yield is to shake the bag before cooking that will distribute the pellets evenly then you have to find the sweet spot for cooking time mine is min sec which leaves me with no burnt or uncooked pieces i only have two minor criticisms the serving size is a little small and the spice mixture is a tad bit too salty for me otherwise these things are tops,hot and fresh
10156,i am so glad we can get these from amazon our family loves these microwave pork rinds and we can no longer get them from local grocery stores if you like pork rinds you love these fresh popped ones,pork rinds
10157,this is a snack that is great any time of the day just enough to share with a friend it is an unusual snack that i cannot find anywhere else except amazon com br i am so happy that it is available,uuuuuuummmmmmmmm and want them everyday
10158,i was delighted to be able to order these since local stores no longer carry them the bags contain what appear to be chips of pork skin that were parboiled in salt water then flattened under high pressure be sure to shake them around to distribute them throughout the bag before cooking they expand considerably in the bag during to of nuking depending on the wattage etc but it is a slow expansion unlike the vigorous popping of corn also the bag only expands about half as much as with popcorn when ready these resemble the ones available in cellophane bags that were deep fried but these are far tastier fresher and much lower in fat and calories a whole bag is calories about calories from fat this is less than the low fat microwave popcorn i use one bag however has of the daily salt limit for an adult br br i especially like these sprinkled with garlic powder and dried marjoram together other herbs and spices are interesting variations such as sage or cumin or whatever else might appeal to you,wonderful if you can handle salt
10159,i love it less than two minutes in the microwave and you have hot crispy and fresh key here some of the already puffed ones in stores are stale chicharrones or pork rinds i found these on a health food site and could not believe it so i ordered a box they are really yummy and as long as you do not overindulge you should enjoy them every time you are seeking something crunchy and salty and low in carbs,yummy fresh pork rinds
10160,i do not like pre cooked pork rinds not even made fresh in the mexican carnecerias but hubby likes them so i decided to buy these br br i was shocked to find that they were light airy and crispy some bags were saltier than others but we have cooked up about so far and the majority are not overly salty br br another reviewer mentioned watching them to figure out how long the cooking time should be in our watt oven seconds seems to be just right br br the key is to take them out the moment the bag has fully inflated leave them in too long and you end up with charcoal and not enough time will make them gummy br br since i follow a fairly low carb regimen for health and weight reasons i like the fact that these can be a perfect vehicle for guacamole and salsa without the carbs i am still trying to come up with more dip ideas that will go well with the flavoring br br i wish they would put out a version that did not have seasoned salt as i would like them with just salt and or garlic,amazingly good
10161,these are an interesting and tasty alternative to microwave popcorn well worth trying the spicy version is not very spicy but has a little kick be careful to even out the contents of the bag before microwaving and to make sure the bag rotates freely in microwaves with a turntable microwave time is short about seconds they come out hot and fresh tasting pieces are relatively small about an inch square they have a less intense pork flavor than the best pork rinds but having them hot helps compensate amazingly pork rinds are becoming diet food they have no carbs there is a lot of air in them that minimizes the calories for the volume and relatively small quantities are satisfying anyway it is a good story to go with a tasty snack,great snack
10162,this was my second order of this product sometimes one bag can be a little salty but in general we really like them i put them in our microwave for minutes and presto you have warm pork rinds be aware they do not making a popping sound like when you make microwave popcorn so do not worry just make sure to follow the instruction and shake the bag well to move them around you cannot seem to find them in the store so it is great that amazon carries them on their site for less than a dollar a bag you have warm fresh pork rinds,love these pork rinds
10163,i bought these for my dad and husband who are doing the atkin diet they love them i live in new jersey so pork rinds are not that popular i describe them to people as funyuns texture with bacon flavor they are very tasty and calorie wise you get alot of bang for your buck they are quite salty however which is not a downside for my family,bacon flavored deliciousness
10164,i do not know if i got a bad batch or something but i could nt get these to cook right i followed the instructions and after about two minutes the bag stoped expanding i opened it and found everything badly burnt the next bag i waited about one and a half minutes i opened it and found half the chips uncooked i never could find a time that either left some uncooked or some burnt i shook the bags and scattered the chips inside them well before microwaving each time,hard to cook
10165,how can pork be bad truly a technical food marvel people are stunned and amazed at microwave pork rinds delicious,lowrey bacon curls microwave pork rinds
10166,and minutes and the smell will make you run for a cold drink open the bag and you are in bacon rind nervona albite a bit salty just cut down on something else because these things are excellent as is if you rated these less than stars you did not follow the directions that is all there is to it minutes later and they are still popping in the bag in most cases they will not last that long put more in the bag,outstanding simple as that
10167,these are really easy to cook in the microwave and are fresh and warm every time they are part of my low carb diet and this is a great price,hot rinds
10168,if you like pork rinds then you absolutely must try these these are pork rinds that basically pop like pop corn in the microwave there is nothing quite like a fresh and hot pork rind the original flavor is great and so is the spicy but the spicy can be a little hot i will never buy premade pork rinds again because of these,great product
10169,this is a delicious product it starts out as little dry hard bits of pork rind you microwave them for the few minutes it states and poof they turn into light tasty fresh pork rinds really cool how it does it love them,lowerys microwave porkrinds
10170,microwave pork rinds figured it was just a bag of the guilty pleasures heated up to add taste appeal so i popped a bag into the microwave and surprise the bag popped back it even puffed up like orville reddenbacher best all that in less than seconds br br turns out the little treats are bagged raw and freeze dried and they actually cook and puff up in the microwave the difference between these guys and an off the shelf bag is the difference between bagged and freshly popped pop corn and since they are cooked without frying or oil they are dare we say healthy well maybe not raw carrots but a third of a bag total out at calories and grams of fat br br not so guilty a pleasure after all,not just another pretty reheat
10171,i normally eat one of these every other day they are very delicious and better than any of the pork rinds you can buy at the gas stations the whole family loves them,delicious
10172,microwave pork rinds hard to find at the store made easy on amazon fast and delivered to your front door at a better price,lowrey microwave pork rinds hard to find at the stores
10173,i have recently had gastric bypass surgery and these are a good source of protein that are quick and easy to make,these were awesome
10174,a great alternative to carb full popcorn warm and satisfying snack salty and crispy remember to watch carefully in the microwave the bag does not pop up so its a little trial error the first time or two you will know when theyre done when you open the bag and everybody looks fluffy,so much better than pre popped kind
10175,i bought this out of curiosity after seeing it on the food network it does taste good you do have to carefully follow the directions on the bag this does not work the same as microwave popcorn the bake time is quite short and overcooked pork rinds are not pretty or tasty i think that in the future if i want warm pork rinds i will try warming up a small batch of my usual brand in the toaster oven for a couple of minutes,nothing special
10176,i have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack i bought this box thinking i could have a decent snack every day well they pop up great in a large enough microwave the issue is the seasoning there is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable br br i now have these when i am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where i know there will be a microwave but i will not be ordering these again once the box is finished br br oh and they are not hot nor spicy just salty,good not great
10177,they are ok i guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it you will find yourself brushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent also no matter what you set the timer on the microwave you will have little burn hardened pieces so you are not even getting a whole lot out of one bag,wayyyyyyy too salty
10178,these are hard to find in the store and my hubby totally loves them bought by the case you get them cheaper than else where great for those on low carb diets crispy crunchy spicy and salty i cannot complain about this quality product,excellent snack
10179,these are a great alternative to your usual par for the course snacks as well as traditional bagged pork rinds i had the same issues with some of the others who have bought them in that finding out how long to microwave them with your particular microwave is a trial and error process on the first bag or two on my first attempt they fluffed up fine but i ended up microwaving them too long and some of them started to scorch leaving a bad burnt smell though not quite as bad as popcorn when the same thing happens spreading them out inside the bag before you start to microwave them is probably the single most important thing you can do it is a little tricky but you can get them to move around a bit with minimal effort if you just throw the bag in the microwave as if it is popcorn you will not get a quality product but if you take the time to spread them out as stated on the bag and then watch the bag until it stops expanding again stated on the bag they are quite good br br once you get the hang of it the bacon curls are pretty delicious especially paired with a beer or two something pale and drinkable from a yard work kind of beer to something like an ipa the curls rinds are light and fluffy but very crunchy surprisingly so i was halfway expecting there to be some kind of greasy sogginess but there isn t they are on the salty side but again with the beer that is a good thing i like how they come out of the package sizzling and popping a bit warm not hot and delicious if you already like pork rinds then this is almost a no brainer as this is the same thing only better fresh warm delicious and with less fat,great snack alternative particularly good with beer
10180,this is an excellent product for curbing the appetite without the abundance of carbs they are crisp fresh and great tasting since i started eating these pork rinds i dropped some unnecessary pounds,amazon lowrey bacon curls
10181,hot fresh salty delicately crisp porky deliciousness in a minute and a half cannot beat that with a stick,yum
10182,i received my shipment today and tried to microwave four bags using different time settings only one or two out of each bag microwave correctly i even put the unpopped on a plate as someone suggested and nothing i carefully followed directions for each bag if i could rate this a zero i would,waste of money
10183,this product is the best they cook up in about a minute and a half nice and hot and crackling plenty of flavor to them o,lowrey microwave pork rinds curls
10184,i saw this product demonstrated on the food channel and knew i had to order it as i love pork rinds but the bagged ones are usually old and sort of stale or processed tasting follow carefully the directions with these for a spicy fresh and tasty snack every time yum,very tasty snack
10185,i am a big fan of eating microwave popcorn a friend of mine suggested pork rines i thought she was crazy little did i know that they are best microwave snack that i have ever eatin in a long time now i can chose between microwave popcorn and pork rinds,best snack i ever ate
10186,the microwaveable pork rinds are the shizzazz no grease no smell no time to thaw go to store to buy a package no time to worry if they are stale or not just put in a bag set timer and by the time your favorite beverage is on the table the pork rinds will be too all cooked and hot br br be sure and follow the safety and cooking instructions,pork rinds from heaven
10187,wow these are great i had them for the super bowl party and everyone just went nuts over this product great taste and just the right snacking size one word of caution follow the directions even though every bag i cooked was absolutely perfect it was evident if you get distracted they will burn real quick remember this product is not popcorn so there is no sound to help let you know its done again follow the directions they are fabulous,fantastic snack
10188,we bought these after seeing a show called unwrapped we have never heard of microwavable pork rinds we absalutely love them and order them regularly,awesome
10189,these are soooo good but make sure you shake the bag and evenly spread the pieces out within the bag and micro for about seconds depending on your microwave always keep an eye on the bag once it blows up to its full area do not let it go for any longer than seconds or they will burn and with the hot and spicy your kitchen and your eyes will feel like you have been pepper sprayed little more difficult to cook but its worth it enjoy,how to micro these
10190,you have pork rinds auto shipped to your house but i dont care having these low carb snacks readily available is great and doesnt impact my insulin usage these are not your fathers pork rinds awesome hot out of the sack,jeff foxworthy says you might be a redneck if
10191,found this item in the grocery store a few years back and then it seemed to just disappear found it here and sooooooo happy that i did everyone that tried it loves it too good thing it comes in the big pack,yummmmmmmmmmmm
10192,but i love these things bagged pork rinds from the grocery are beyond disgusting they do not look smell or taste appealing but fresh nuked pork rinds are a very different story these pigskins come out toasty and dare i say it delicious significantly lighter and more airy than their grocery store counterparts they say you can use them to scoop up salsa or dip but they are very good on their own and i think the porky taste would not go well with salsa anyway maybe french onion dip i will have to try that br br these pork rinds seemed fairly salty to me but when i crave chips and such it is usually the salt and crunch that i am really after so it was not a problem microwaving pork rinds who knew,i hate to admit it
10193,what a thrill to receive in their stockings no kidding i cannot see it myself but the rest of the family is utterly wild about these little things just like a mini trip to the state fair warm and crackling from the microwave,microwave pork rinds
10194,we discovered these a few years ago and they are about the only pork rinds we consume now makes a great quick snack only complaint would be with the heat time since microwaves vary so much it is hard to determine the exact time needed to make them nice and crispy fluffy without over or under cooking flavor is always consistent and good,yummmm
10195,bought these for my brother and he loves them br br hot out of the microwave and some beers,for my brother
10196,i tried these and wanted to like them but just couldn t they did not seem to pop very well a lot of wasted product in the bag and they did not taste very good i will not be buying these again,not very good
10197,if you like pork rinds these are the best i buy these for the bar that i own and they are a favorite with the customers so simple pop them in the microwave for minutes and you have fresh hot pork rinds i have these on scheduled delivery so i will never run out nice option great snack,lowery microwave pork rinds
10198,many years ago i purchased lawry microwave pork rinds at walmart and publix and then they were gone from both stores and then i got the brilliant idea to try amazon com i have actually ordered cases for myself and my sons we are thrilled you will never want any other pork rinds after you have tasted these,hot pork rinds
10199,great product but it is a little tricky to figure out the best time needed for your microwave oven ours is pretty strong and minute to seconds is about right however be warned if you have an inexpensive or low power oven the results will be very poor at best just ask the crew where i work when i tried to make a bag in the company cheap oven it was super slow to expand and after the better part of minutes the burnt smell forced then to keep the door to the break room open for the rest of the afternoon bottom line if you do not have a quality oven do not buy these one last word after you remove the bag from the oven carefully open shake and simply blow on them until they stop crackling otherwise they will seem stale until they cool all this sounds like a pile of work but after the first couple bags you will never buy pork rinds at the store again i get a discount on the price because i have a box sent automatically every month works out to just under a box with free shipping enjoy,great product but
10200,i have bought this product many times and this time they are old or defective the bags do not puff up and rinds are flat stale burn when cooked i have tried different time settings and in different microwaves br br i m very dissapointed as this is a product i have been ordering for years guess i will have to call them and complain,unhappy for the first time
10201,yuck these do not taste good and they are quite tough better off buying the bags of rinds already prepaired,yuck
10202,i have also tried the regular lowrey microwavable rinds and both are good i love that they can sit on the shelf for weeks and then be microwaved quickly into a warm snack the hot and spicy is not overdone there is some heat but you can still taste the rinds the heat is just enough to slow you down so you do not consume the whole bag in less than five minutes br br i also love to hear the crackle sound when you pull them from the microwave it adds to the experience,good snack
10203,these pork rinds are a great alternative to the bagged variety in the stores out of the microwave in less than minutes they are warm and have a great smoky flavor follow the directions making sure you shake the bag horizontally to distribute the pieces as evenly as possible watch the bag if you have a powerful microwave like i do past it will take less than minutes the little pop and crackling noise when i pour them out reminds me of pop rocks they are a great low carb snack,yummy
10204,pork rinds are the delicacy of the south and among various latin american carribean and asian cultures br br my friends introduced to me the fastest way to cure my cravings microwave pork rinds i was a little skeptical at first but since i is not too picky when it comes to eatin i said ok br br just put the package into the microwave and minutes later you are about to feast on fresh tasting crispy pork rinds be careful when you take them out of the microwave though they are hotter than a coal miner in the month of june you can see the steam emanating from the package and they are cracklin hot but guys and gals this is the real deal they are crispy and oh sooooo good that you will be heating up another package before you know it br br now i can get them and eat them when traveling as long as i have a microwave readily available br br this innovation is as good as microwave tater tots br br mmmmm mmmmm good,hooh weee pork rinds from a microwave you all gotta try these
10205,i am on a low carb diet and it is very difficult to resist temptation when my family has freshly popped popcorn now i have found the solution lowry microwavable pork rinds pop in the microwave exactly like popcorn and only carb per serving plus i love the way the curls keep making the popping sound in my mouth as i eat them like pop rocks candy i got the regular which is salted just enough for my taste i also eat them with salsa as a snack which replaces chips crumbled on a salad is a great replacement for croutons thank you lowry for coming up with a product that is such a life saver to my diet,it is like popcorn for low carb dieters
10206,these are wonderful and they are approvesd snacks for the weight loss program i am on,love it
10207,these microwave pork rinds are quite tasty for them to be cooked in the microwave my husband and i love the hot spicy flavor better than the plain because it has more flavor the only drawback i see to these is that if you have an older microwave or one that is not as powerful at least watts the pork rinds do not cook as well,tasty
10208,these are very tasty easy to fix a great snack for diabetics no carbs,great as expected
10209,quick and easy snack consistently tasty and good quality they do however require different cook times in different microwaves actually healthier than potato chips,lowrey microwave pork rinds original
10210,great product and good price husband loves the taste and they are very flavorful when warm,great
10211,these rinds are so good if you eat one you may want to keep on buying them great price for a cased product,great value for a club sized snack pack
10212,i have been eating these for years they are quick to microwave tasty and not terribly bad for you br i first found them about years ago on a local grocery store shelf soon after they were gone from the stores for some reason found them on amazon a few of years ago and have been ordering them ever since always good br tip make sure you store them at a reasonable temperature i let some get too warm in my luggage and they sort of spoiled before i could micriwave them,great quick snack
10213,these are great snacks being able to cook them fresh really makes them taste better than the average pre cooked store bought ones great alternative to popcorn i ordered both the hot spicy and the original i prefer the hot spicy but i like spicy foods you cannot go wrong with either one,great porkrinds
10214,love it i always try to tell my friends so they can buy them too,love it
10215,these are the best i have had the flavor is amazing and they crisp right up in no time i have tried other brands before and they just do not cut it i will be buying a lot more of these i wish walmart still carried them,best ever
10216,too much msg gives it a nasty salty after taste i basically gave them away,nasty
10217,we love these and will order again soon all of our friends that we shared with had to have a bag or two so are almost out,great rinds
10218,if you like pork rinds you will love these i got them while doing thrive and they were so good i have introduced them to several others and now there is about of my co workers that love them too try them you will love them,hot pork rinds oh yes
10219,i like the taste of these but they are inconsistent in texture some are really really hard while others are what you would expect you have to be careful with the microwaving part but even when you are it is hard to get consistent results they also could be a little spicier for my taste,not bad but hard to get right
10220,these pork skins have a great taste very fresh homemade taste the cooking procedure can be a bit tricky though i have a w microwave with a turn table and did not get the same results with each bag the first bag i tried with minute and additional second intervls stopping at min seconds several skins had not yet cooked so i rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it more seconds still some did not fully explode or bloom the second bag i started with minute seconds slightly better results but again i needed to re roll the end of the bag and give it another seconds still using the second intervals for best results the third bag i started with minutes which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting and the results were not as good too many had over cooked and were too hard to eat br my suggestion would be to stick with the minute with second intervals listening closely to the sound they emit a slight hissing sound when they expand as soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides it is a good sign you have reached the optimal result this item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store but the improved flavor is worth it to me anyway the jury is still out on whether the healthy claim can hold water i will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion good eats,great taste tricky procedure
10221,i love these but have only been able to find them at one location in our town and have to order them on line i was resently diagnosed as pre diabetic and needed to lose weight i showed these to my nutritionist who was very impressed and planned to recommend them to other patients as a snack warm from the microwave they are so much better than the regular rinds,lowreys pork rinds
10222,we used to buy these at an area store and then suddenly they did not carry them anymore this is the way to eat pork rinds just the right amount and way better than a bag from the grocery store and even with the shipping and handling the price is better enjoy,perfect pork rinds
10223,could not find these in the local stores anymore so i was glad to find them at amazon this is a great tasting low fat snack,great snack
10224,i found these pork rinds several years ago and just love them i did not believe at first that they would really pop in the microwave but they do just like pop corn they are so great because you get to eat them warm instead of just out of the bag,pork rinds
10225,when i saw the price of the pork rinds plus free shipping and since i had never tried the micro rinds before i decided i would give it a try i ordered a box of the spicy and one of the original br they were here in no time br we have a watt micro and we experimented a couple of times and found that seconds was perfect for us if we have a few that do not puff up which rarely happens you can put the few on a paper plate and put them back in the micro and it takes just a few seconds for them to puff up br because i am not a spicy food lover i was not as crazy about the spicy as the original but my husband loved them so that made it possible for each of us to have a box of our own wahoo i did not have to share with him worked out great br i would liked to have had a little less salt on them but was able to knock some off just by tapping the rind on the plate as i ate them br br i would give this an excellent rating in fact i am going to order more boxes after i finish this,micro pork rinds freshest you can buy
10226,enjoy this treat on my low carb diet nice to have a chip to dip,good for low carbs
10227,these are great but i find they need about to minutes to cook and let stand more minutes,best i could ever eat
10228,excellent product bag expands like popcorn chowed a bag during avatar the the other night and fell like i was at the movies,excellent
10229,these are absolutely wonderful and they are shipped every month to my home so i do not even have to buy them from the store i also get them for less than half the price i would pay at the store i love shopping online,great if you love fresh hot hot and spicy porkrinds
10230,the lowery original and hot spicy pork rinds are great i can take them with me on trips pop them in the microwave and have a great late night snack and i do not have to be concerned about carbs i would highly recommend any one who like pork rinds to give them a try and be ready for a surprise when they come out of the microwave the price from amazon was very good and it was delivered in a couple of days br br steve puente br br p s lowrey bacon curls microwave pork rinds hot spicy ounce packages pack of i purchased one of each,the original and the spicy microwave pork rinds are very good
10231,ok but too salty they should make a low sodium version the spicy is better,pork rhinds origional flavor
10232,these are no comparison to the packaged skins in the store one taste and you are hooked,you must try these
10233,i first purchased this product a few months ago after a co worker mentioned them so i decided to try them out for myself to my surprise they are very delicious i am sold and will continue to buy them if you like hot fresh pork rinds and spicy ones this product is for you sincerely summer,best pork rinds ever
10234,great taste no carbs i am diabetic and low cal also only drawback may be sodium content when you need a cracker for a dip i use them i just make the dip from fat free sour cream and onion soup mix the dip has more cal than the pork rinds i n short they are a cracker substitute for me br br most complaints are improper cooking results hate to say this but it is your microwave not the product there are microwave ovens that have a real bad hot spot and this burns them i had an oven like this older model and the problem went away with the new microwave br br but the biggest thing in their favor is the taste love both kinds,great diet snack also
10235,i very much enjoy the microwave pork rinds scheduled deliveries make things simple and convenient,lowrey microwave pork rinds
10236,if you are a fan of cracklins you will love these hot and fresh the microwave does a remarkable job not too salty and they have a true crackln taste,crisp in an instant
10237,could not get the bags to pop any edible pork rinds i tried several bags with no results i finally had to throw them out i was very dissapointed with this product,very disappointed
10238,we were very pleased with the product and have introduced family and friends to it and all have been very pleased and suprised so we will be continuing to order these great product,lowry pork rinds
10239,i hated the flavor of this product i ended up just giving it away at work who ended up giving it away to there friends,worse ever
10240,i love these things but they are no longer sold in grocery stores believe me i have searched it was great to find them and for a reasonable price at amazon br br i know i know they are junk food however compared to the pork rinds you would buy in a bag the microwave version is considerably lower in fat as far as flavors go i prefer the hot spicy it is a lot more interesting than regular br br suggestion eat them while they are still warm they are much better that way,hard to find but amazon has em
10241,we love these pork rinds so easy to make and low fat too the seasoning has just enough heat to give a kick but not overwhelm you we used to buy them occasionally from a local store but have not seen them in ages thanks amazon for carrying them,love em
10242,this is the best low carb snack next to popcorn they are both microwavable i like it best with a sprinkle of lemon juice,the best low carb snack
10243,you need to make sure the pieces are evenly distributed throughout the bag before you microwave it with my microwave i find on high is the best shake bag well when you first pull it out for at least seconds this ensures the hot and spicy seasoning to be evenly coated then enjoy i eat em with a beer,great snack for after those late nights drinking
10244,everyone who tried the pork rinds loved them and were amazed that you could cook them in the microwave,amazing
10245,so excited about this food find that i have already e mailed friends and family about it br br in the past i would buy a bag of chicharron when i craved a taste and eat at most of it then when i needed a bit to top a savory filipino dish pancit palabok or monggo i would find the bag had gone stale so i would toss the bag and buy a new one to begin another cycle of wastefulness br br lowrey microwave pork rinds to the rescue in minutes or less each bag produces crisp not greasy tasty chicharron about cups at a time the perfect amount for me oh and the expiration date on these bags is june so i am set for at least a year for in the past i have thrown out maybe one bag per month br br my mr science hubby is so amazed with this product he is taking a bag to work today to show his techie guys one is south american and gives us those huge chicharrones fried in a vat of oil by his mother in law the other is muslim and does not eat pork,terrific food find
10246,wow it is amazing how so simple a snack can be so tasty i wanted something crunchy that was not a carb you might want to eat only bland veggies the rest of the day because it is high in fat and sodium but a great guilty pleasure nonetheless,the best pork rinds you will ever eat unless you own a bbq restaurant
10247,we originally found these at wally world when we could no longer get there i hit the internet both are quite good we prefer the spicy,tasty
10248,i normally rate whatever items i buy but rarely offer words of advice well these things changed my mind i love pork rinds usually i buy a tub of them from sam but since i am the only one in the house who eats them they go stale long before i can make a dent in them so i saw these and the positive reviews and thought hey that is the perfect solution it is a perfect solution all right a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds br br i made the first bag as per the directions i had no problem with them crisping at all they were perfect in that regard nice and crunchy but the taste is awful i thought perhaps it was a bad bag nope the second batch tasted just as terrible i have no idea what they use to flavor them but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap there is enough salt in them to kill a horse which in and of itself would not be so bad i actually like salty things but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning it left me hunting for listerine or gasoline whatever i could get my hands on to get the taste out of my mouth i am still shuddering from it if you like the taste of feet go for it if not i would suggest heading to sam to buy the wonderful tasting pork rinds we all know and love,tastes like feet
10249,lowrey bacon curls pork rinds ounce microwave bags are loaded with milligrams of salt thats all i tasted a pinch of salt would have been better,lowrey bacon curls pork rinds
10250,the bags catch fire in my microwave and that leaves most un popped and extremely over salted this product is inferior to other brands i have tried,fire hazard
10251,not one member of my family including me like these extremely salty much too strong a bq taste to order more i purchased them on a recuring basis and i wish to cancel now i have received only one shipment cancel further shipments not to our taste at all these are lowery pork rinds,flavor much too strong
10252,the taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all i bought a box of these so i tried to perfect the technique several times with not much better outcomes all in all i will stick with the ready to go variety offered by frito lay and mission,not what i expected
10253,the lowrey microwave pork rinds that i received was unacceptable i ordered bags and the bags only popped of the bag all rinds popped but for the amount of the money that i paid for them i could have gone to the store and bought a bag already popped and gotten a full bag i feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag i understand that everyone is counting their pennies but i also think that the consumer should get something for their money i really enjoy this product but i probably will not order any more for this reason,lawrey microwave pork rinds review
10254,on july i ordered lowrey hot and spicy pork rinds i received the orginal pork rinds i am not happy with this product i will keep them as they will be to expensive to send them back i feel you should have checked my previous orders i had ordered or at least contacted me about my order thank you colleen avey,wrong product
10255,so i made one bag of these pork rinds it came out good i decided to try another the taste was unbelievable it had an ammoniated taste smell to it i thought that maybe it was a bad bag i stayed away for a few weeks decided to give them another try bad idea they tasted like ammonia again this was not caused by incorrect cooking time because they all came out looking puffy and crispy i ended up throwing the box out,tasted like ammonia
10256,a warning should be placed on the item description because this product contains monosodium glutamate msg a dangerous excitotoxin which is problematic for many people there is no indication in the item description that this is the case i fully agree with another reviewer that this item also is so extremely salty that it cannot be consumed the msg also heightens the very salty taste this item did puff up very nicely in the microwave but it was inedible because of the saltiness and all packages had to be thrown out for that reason i am surprised at the many excellent reviews of this product amazon com gets an a for their wonderful handling of this problem,not edible msg excessive salt
10257,horrible hemical taste extremely salty br br this was a complete waste of money after the first bag i will have to throw the whole box away,do not waste your money
10258,i tried to cook different bags of these only a fraction of product popped up the ones that managed to pop tasted overly salty and had an unusual flavor unfortunately they were not returnable so the rest will be going to the trash waste of,horrid
10259,i was surprised at how well the rinds popped and did not have any difficulties as other reviewers did i made sure that i unfolded the package it folded into three just like a microwave popcorn pack unbent the folds so that the product could move between the three areas then i shook it vigorously several times trying to distribute the contents somewhat evenly throughout the bag two minutes in my microwave watts but years old is perfect and virtually all rinds pop every time br br this is a low fat product so it is not nearly as tasty as the supermarket pork rinds you may have tried one could easily eat an entire package although there are three servings per bag but you will pay the consequences in terms of salt intake and msg overload the msg triggered a migraine for me so now i do not eat it frequently and make sure i only consume half a bag at most when i get near the bottom of the bag where the most salt and msg ends up i try to brush off as much as i can br br still a good snack option for those with blood sugar sensitivities zero carbs is always good the only reason for my star review is that the amount of msg per bag seems to be pretty high and that is not disclosed on the product amazon page,high msg content but otherwise a great low carb fat snack
10260,i ordered this product lowry pork rind and received it promptly within two days i have not been able to pop one bag they all stay flat nothing works my microwave is not the problem as i cook lots of other things in it looks to me that the product is not longer any good by the comments they may have started out great but it no longer is worth buying,very disappointing will never order again
10261,this is my first time and i cannot eat them they are all small hard peaces with only a frw puffie ones is there something wrong with my batch i cannot eat them or they would break my teeth am i doing something wrong i only cook them min,do not understand
10262,i bought these on another online site and the amazon ones are almost cheaper i love these in fact i have grown quite addicted unfortunatley they have tons of sodium and also contain msg which is causing me to gain a lb or two of water weight and stalls my weight loss progress very effectively if i were only trying to maintain these would not be a problem br br i will not buy them again for these reasons,love these but they do not love me
10263,this product is fantastic instead of popcorn we eat pork rinds they have no carbs which have helped us to keep our weight down we feel we have made a better choice we eat them practically every night thanks for a great product,lowreys pork rinds
10264,i bought these last month as part of an amazon promotion buy items get percent off i had never heard of this product but have a soft spot in my belly for the snacks i grew up on as a kid these things turned out way better than expected they are essentially pork rinds from your typical supermarket but they are fresh still crackling and popping after you open the bag i am addicted to these now and have had to ratio them out so i do not eat them every night they are that good,shockingly good
10265,these are wonderful we found them on vacation i like the fact that you only use a small bag no waste br br will be ordering again soon br br jeannie,bacon curls
10266,the product itself is great it is the bag that needs work i recommend that instead of microwaving them in the bag spread them out on a paper plate or a microwave safe plate then popping them in the microwave for about seconds you do have to watch these cook though or they will burn on you i really like the pork rinds themselves and they are a healthy alternative to chips though they are a little salty,great product bad design
10267,i bought one to try based on the reviews for the pack for they popped perfectly tasted delicious crunchy not too hard not too spicy not too salty and are a really healthy snack br br zero grams saturated fat total protein per bag grams total calories per bag br br within minutes of tasting them i ordered an pack these things fall into the totally awesome pile for sure br br if you like pork rinds and eating low fat high protein snacks this item might work out well for you,totally awesome snack low fat high protein yum yum
10268,for pork rind lovers these are the best hot spicy low fat and crunchy,excellent low fat high flavor
10269,i like them a lot got a batch after seeing it on a tv show the first bag seemed a little off to me but then i realized it was bacause they were not fried after that i like them a lot i think they could be hotter i found that you want to start at the low end of the cooking time and work up for me about bags was enough to figure out that was the perfect time for my microwave long enough that they all pop but not so long that anything happens to the early poppers br br my daughter loves them also and we are going through them at a pretty good clip i am going to put them on auto reorder when this batch is gone they are perfect for evening snacking when the mood hits since you make them as you eat them never a stale bag and the size is just about perfect for that br br that my cents worth,i like em
10270,the more powerful your microwave the better they turn out seconds in ours and they are large up to inches and fluffy mixed with a few crunchies our microwave at work is lame they burn or do not pop completely i think i am hooked i subscribe to them i always like having them around for when i want something but i do not know what oh and with a few drops of franks x tra hot,these are great
10271,carbs and calories in an entire bag br have a slightly different texture than regular rinds but still great br if your watching sodium these may be a little high for you over mg sodium in the bag,great low carb snack
10272,to anyone who likes pork rinds this is for you but you got to have a strong microwave so they turn out lite and fluffy and they taste fantastic,bigbert
10273,these pork rinds contain msg which is not stated on the listing deceptive listing for this product will not purchase again shame on amazon for wasting my money,contains msg
10274,they were very salty and seasoned with a seasoning that my family and myself did not like i shared with co workers and they did not like them either we still have the balance and hate to pitch them but if we can not find someone who likes them that we can give them to we will i think they were awful,ms
10275,i was so excited when i heard about this product i love pork rinds but these have a nasty chemical smell and they really do not taste good at all do not waste your money i actually threw the remaining packages away they really suck,they stink
10276,the product being new is fair but have not had too much luck getting it to expand much have tooooooo many flat hard pieces flavor is okay but has a greasy taste to start like it is been sitting in bacon grease i have trust that in time the product will improve as all new products do i think it is a good concept and hope it does get better,under par
10277,these taste just like any other packaged pork rind product i have tried i was hoping these would be fresher closer to the real thing i buy in mexican markets oh well for a quick snack when you do not feel like leaving the house it is fine,convenient but disappointing
10278,after reading all the positive reviews i was really looking forward to finally getting a very low carb somewhat low calorie snack that i can work into my low carb living i have had pork rinds from the stores and thought they were pretty good so i expected this to be at or better than my local convenience store brand wrong i was first disappointed with the texture after following the instructions to microwave from minutes some about were crispy but the rest were almost like taffy and would stick to the teeth perhaps i did not cook long enough so nd bag stayed in longer which made a few more crispy but more burnt and chewy ones but texture is only the problem the biggest issue was that the product taste like the bag the taste of the microwave bag seems to bake into the product giving them a paper bag taste finally those without the full paper bag taste did not really have a lot of flavor they were salty which is to be expected but that is really all the flavor you get so if your desperate and too lazy to get out a store or cannot find any in a near by store this may work for you it works out to about a bag so i am not totally disappointed as my dog loves them by the way my dog gives them stars,you have to be really desperate
10279,these pork rinds by lowery suck br br i have tried to leave a review but it appears that amazon com has their heads as far up their a es as lowery i do not expect to see this posted,do not waste your money i used to by oh boy oberto pork rinds several years ago and they were very good
10280,this is a great idea but just like baking a cake you cannot do it in a midrowave,terrible
10281,i got these for my dad from his wish list he thought they would be spicy and flavorful but they just tasted like cumin and had a funky smell the box came with individual bags but after you open one bag it is impossible to even want to put yourself through that again they are nasty avoid them at all cost yuck,they taste soooo bad gross
10282,lowrey bacon curls pork rinds ounce microwave bags are loaded with milligrams of salt thats all i tasted a pinch would have been better or no salt at all,lowrey bacon curls pork rinds
10283,i am a lover of pork rinds so i was really looking forward to eating fresh ones neathers to say they dident cook in mins like it says it would and if you put it in that long most would burn to a crisp by that time another thing that really dident appel to me is that the taste is like they poured tones of salt on them before they packaged them i wanted to eat pork rinds not salt if i wanted to salt i would just get it from the salt in my seasons cabnet very disappointed,to salty dident microwave right
10284,in all fairness my friend absolutely loves this product i purchased it based upon his suggestion unfortunately the smell oil i am assuming of it cooking made me feel ill even though the product cooked perfectly the smell lingered in my microwave for well over a day,not for me
10285,i considered buying these but the health risks should be considered br br these are cured stored with salt and have nitrates br br if you look on the american cancer society web site you will see that those are cancer causing concerns br br you can still eat well when avoiding such things,what about health
10286,i recieved my bacon crisps the price is ok but i did not order hot do not know how to change my subscription,i did not order hot
10287,these are amazing for the low carber i cannot believe they are not available any more,amazing
10288,these lowrey bacon curls are wonderful they are so fresh great tasting have found however that cooking them in the bag does not work very well so we spread them out in a single layer and heat for minutes in a watt microwave will be ordering them again,wonderful fresh
10289,love these was unable to find them in local stores so i ordered them thanks great low carb snack,lowrey bacon curls
10290,these things are great if you like pork rinds try these out stick them in the microwave for and enjoy,microwavable bliss
10291,these are as good or better than the deep fried ones you get at theme parks across the country,these are great
10292,microwave pork rinds make a great and easy snack for diabetics they are extremely low carb and hi protein and also low fat for those who are dieting,wonderful snack item
10293,when you need a quick snack try these in about seconds it is ready hot and tasty just what you need for watching a movie on tv you can make them and still catch most of the commerical,quick and easy
10294,i have popped several of these bags in the past week and every single one of them does not pop up as much as they used to they used to pop up like a bag of popcorn does these bags stay very flat in the microwave oven and when you take the bag out you have to be very quick about opening it or it implodes and sticks together br br i used to purchase these microwave pork rinds direct from the company and had never had a problem until now br br so it is up to you to decide if you want to buy these or not they are very tasty and very healthy for you too,ok product but
10295,these are a wonderful snack better than popcorn and they are not so hard on the teeth like other pork rhinds,lowrey microwave pork rhinds
10296,being a gluten sensitive individual i was lured into a false sense of security when i read the simple ingredients on this amazon info page br br because i did not first do my homework and read the labels before i began consuming these i ended up having a massive asthma attack just wanted to let everyone who has these sensitivities allergies to avoid this product,warning contains msg and maltodextrin
10297,my husband loves pork rinds i however was freaked even thinking about deep friend pork skin but i am always willing to try new things so over the years i have choked down countless brands of pork rinds to appease my husband br br one day i was at work at a hotel and i notice over on the snacks for sale shelf microwaveable pork rinds i was like wtf you gotta be kidding me so being the good wife i am i buy them more as a joke than anything else for my husband well he zapped them bad boys and started happily munching away oohing and ahhhing over how good they were so i tried one i refused to tell him that it was pretty good over time i bought him more even ordering them thru the hotel ya employee discount and he noticed that i would ever so casually walk by and snatch one from his bag finally i gave up and just made myself a bag i am now hopelessly addicted however no longer work for the hotel so i needed a new supplier lol br br our microwave has a popcorn button on a whim i gave it a shot figuring it would be a microwave disaster much to my surprise i got perfect bags of porky crunchy goodness every time and when i say perfect i mean not one single under done or burn piece for the life of me i cant figure out how the microwave can use the same button to make popcorn and the pork rinds so perfectly but i chalk it up to magic br br be forewarned if you have dogs these are doggy crack yes i know don t give the dogs people food yadda yadda i am convinced if you waved one of these little buggers in front of your dog and told him to speak he would not bark he would recite shakespeare i have never seen my dogs go that crazy over anything else,i really didnt want to like these
10298,my day had been nothing exceptional i had forgotten to take lunch and the afternoon was dragging upon returning to my desk i saw a bag of these on my desk that had been here for a few days a gift from a friend i decided to take them to the microwave and give them a try i fully expected to pop them and open the door to the worst smell i could fathom imagine my surprise when the bell dinged and i opened the door to the delicious smell of still sizzling savoriness that is lowrey how n spicy bacon curls it was like cherubim descended from heaven and placed god favorite snack in my mouth i was bathed in a pillar of light and from nowhere the volume rose to a crescendo of beethoven th symphony at that moment i realized that my life had been building to this moment this one perfect instant in time i felt as if my tongue was nodding in approval and i shed a single tear of joy if i have another son i will name him lowrey,if popcorn and bacon had a baby
10299,we really love this product many times we have bought pork rinds from the store and have had to toss them out because they were no longer fresh but lowrey microwave pork rinds are made fresh each time you microwave a bag it is amazing how much the ounce bag makes more than enough to share if i have a complaint it is that they are a bit salty my husband i have remedied that by adding them to our popcorn we pop on the stove then the salt is dispersed into the popcorn a href http www amazon com gp product b k lq e lowrey bacon curls microwave pork rinds bags original case a,love these
10300,a delicious product cannot seem to find it in the stores these days i recommend to try if you like pork rinds br quick delivery and great to have for guests,great taste small price
10301,wish they were stocked in stores but glad to be able to find them online not only food for white trash they are low carb and make the perfect snack food the aroma from the microwave during the cooking process is heavenly be sure to shake the bag per package direction a must for the pork rind addict after you try these you will never go back to prepackaged rinds,you will never go back to prepackaged pork rinds
10302,if your a pork rind lover this is an awesome product for those wonderful taste buds they melt in your mouth before they go down mmm mmm good,delicious for those taste buds
10303,this is a great product you do have to play around with the cooking time for your microwave or you can easily overcook the product was delivered quickly and in great condition,pork rinds
10304,i am currently deployed and i am on a low carb and high protein diet but my current location does not allow me to go out into town easily to get the type of foods that would keep me on my diet so i ordered this from amazon br br pros br fast shipping br taste great br zero carbs br br cons br does make the room smell once you open the package br so be mindful of anybody else who might complain just open it outside through a window or stand under a ventilation fan br br i ve read reviews of people have trouble cooking it here is my method br br the instructions says cook for minutes but i set it to minutes br after seconds i open the door flip the package and shake it to spread the pieces out again br after another seconds i flip the package one more time and help the bag expand by just shaking the pieces around br then i will let cook for about a total time of then stop and open the bag and place the rinds in a bowl or container br br i ll then look through to see if any have not expanded yet i will just throw them in the microwave without the bag on a plate or napkin and just let them cook for a minute br br there you are done br br i like to dip them in hot sauce enjoy,delicious and easy to make
10305,these pork rinds are delicious but learning how to cook them in your microwave takes some practice my first bags were wasted but i finally just dumped the bag on a paper plate and microwaved it and they turned out great the bag has nothing to do with the cooking so i actually just emptied all of my bags into one big ziplock bag so i can put how many i want on a plate and only cook a few at a time cooks better that way br br all that said when these babies puff they are delicious,delicious
10306,i first tried lowrey bacon curls when they were offered at a local club store since then the only way to find them had been to order them streight from the manufacturer until now i would had mixed results with the microwave process i would had many bags just burn without popping recently just for fun i thought i would see what would happen if i tried lower wattage it worked now i use my watt microwave vs the watt microvave i would initially used,wonderful pork rinds microwave with care
10307,this is my fourth order of these pork rinds and i am not sure what is up but something really amiss the bags are leaking some kind of grease and do not fluff up during the microwave process i used to love these so hopefully this is just a bad batch if not then lowrey needs to look into this and fix whatever has happened to a once great snack,what happened
10308,it cooks in microwave so fast and it is really good right after you cook but unfortunately it has msg in it nonetheless the fat and sodium content on this is not too bad when compared to regular pork rinds i uploaded a photo of the nutrition facts so you can see the ingredients too,so tasty but has msg
10309,this was my second purchase of this product the first purchase was great but this nd must have been a defective batch most packs did not cook correctly because they were not sealed tight and opened during cooking that caused them to burn or not cook completely i did not send them back because i kept thinking maybe the next one will be better but i was wrong there are a few packs left but i am hesitant about microwaving them i will probably purchase some again but it will not be anytime soon,bad batch
10310,i cannot find these in the local store so i order them they have much better flavor than the already prepared kind microwave like popcorn low carb be sure to shake the package like it says,bacon curls very good
10311,i love these both kinds once you try them you will not be able to eat the prepackaged ones ever again they are crispy spicy and fresh,lawry hot spicy bacon curls pork rinds
10312,i have been eating these regular and spicy for several years they are definitely superior to the non microwave kind shake the bag as directed to make sure they are not stacked on each other and i put them on the popcorn setting in my microwave soooo good,microwave bacon curls are great
10313,we originally found these at wally world when we could no longer get there i hit the internet both are quite good we prefer the spicy,tasty
10314,i am so glad these are finally available again my boyfriend loves these i try to buy them every month for him,microwave pork rinds
10315,the next best thing to fresh br br if youve never had fresh pork rinds this is something youve got to try,great product
10316,i love these things i used to be able to get them at wal mart and a couple local grocery stores now i have a hard time finding them but they are available through amazon i like all kinds of pork rinds but most of the ones you buy in the store already made have a high fat content people on a low carb diet can eat any kind but if you are watching your fat intake these are an excellent alternative i always include them in my diet they are not the most filling snack however a bag usually satisfies your craving for a salty snack i buy boxes of them at a time from amazon so i never run out,lowrey bacon curls microwave
10317,these pork rinds are the bomb they are excellent coming out of the microwave yum,they are delicious
10318,i like the texture to these pork rinds more than any others there is something special about have these hot and fresh cooked try dipping them in nacho cheese with jalapeno slices,texture
10319,i am kind of addicted to these i like both the hot and spicy and the plain lowrey bacon curls microwave pork rinds but like the hot and spicy best i found the perfect time in my microwave of but had to experiment to find the right amount of time before taking them out of the plastic i shake them a little once in a while they will fly out of the bag when i try to shake it when the bag is out of the plastic and opened flat like the directions show you really need to get them dispersed in the bag before popping if you want full big puffy pork rinds which i think needs to be done more than times like the directions state some bags do seem fuller than others however i have to agree these do stink when taken out of the microwave i turn my stove fan on before taking them out of the microwave and pour them out of the bag under the fan and hold the bag and bowl up to the fan for a few seconds br i ve tried dipping these into ranch dressing which is a bit of a treat too but seems to make the porky too soggy but i like the taste of it,i eat these too much
10320,my husband loves these right now we are currently stationed overseas and it just brings back a little of home to him amazon has been the only place that i can find that sell these,great choice for husbands
10321,the ortega microwave port rinds pop up like popcorn and they taste fresh and has excellent flavor the shipment arrived in great shape and was shipped promptly,excellent pork rinds
10322,this is a very tasty snack although a little too salty otherwise i love them,great snack
10323,if you enjoy pork rinds like i do you cannot miss this product a minute and a half in the microwave and you have got warm crunchy deliciousness there is just the right amount of spice too this is a great product,microwave pork rinds are fantastic
10324,just got these and tried them over the weekend they were easy to cook and taste great my husband saw that i had them and tried them as well so now i am glad they come to a box these will be a staple on our snack shelf there is a big differance between store bought and these these are sooo much fresher and tastier they also fit very well into my high protein low carb diet it is wonderful to snack on something with a crunch to it,yummmmm
10325,no carbs this is my favorite snack very light and crunchy not as dry as the packaged pork rinds i love these been getting these for years and still order them every months,my nightly snack
10326,i love these things warm pork rinds that tast fresh and the size of the bag is just the right size,great snack
10327,wal mart used to carry these lowrey microwave pork rinds in a pack but as everybody knows just because it on wal marts shelf today does not mean it will be there tomorrow well they discontinued carring them and i was bummed out beyond belief i love these things i done a search on line and found then on amazon com and you cannot imagine how happy i was i bought cases of them my whole family is addicted to them did i mention i love these things they go into my microwave for minute and seconds and you have hot fresh pork rinds they are so much better than the pork rinds in the bag on the potato chip isle thumbs up,lowrey microwave pork rinds
10328,a friend of mine sent me some of theese and i thought it sounded kinda gross but found they were quite good for a snack but the only place i have found them on the west coast is online,pork rinds
10329,if you like pork rinds you are going to love these they come out of the microwave so warm light and crispy great snack if you are on low carbs,warm and crispy
10330,lowrey chicaronnes are probably the best pork rinds available in the usa always fresh after proper time in the micro wave,best chicaronnes
10331,i would not have these every day but i found them to have plenty of flavour and kind of fun to cook,not too bad
10332,after buying these for quite sometime i was quite disappointed when walmart did not carry them any more they are not the same brand but still pretty good i wish there was more in the bag you do not get a whole lot in each bag i am glad to have them though i bought cases and when i run out will probably get more,happy to find this product
10333,at first i thought the product was a joke but not so delicious and fresh try them,microwave pork rinds
10334,i tried both the original and the hot and spicy both are marvelous only problem i have is that both are a little on the salty side minutes in the microwave and you have cracklin pork rinds i can no longer find any in my local super market this is a wonderful substitution,lowery microwave pork rinds
10335,i take various snacks into work and get repaid by the honor system i thought i would try these because they are something different from the usual chips cookies they were a huge hit ten packages were gone the first day and everybody was walking around with a smile on their face spreading the word i will definitely be ordering more,big smiles
10336,i found microwave pork rinds quite by accident but ever since they are something i have wanted now i found them on amazon and i could not be happier br it is a quick easily prepared snack and as other reviewers have pointed out not bad for your diet br once they come put of the microwave open the bag pour them out and marvel as you hear them still popping and crackling in the bowl i may never go back to bagged pork rinds ever again,a tasty snack
10337,i can no longer find these in our local stores my whole family loves these my kids love to hear them pop the taste is very good we prefer these over popcorn very happy to find these i will buy more,very good
10338,i heated these up in the microwave and they do not microwave evenly some will be burnt and hard as a rock when others will be just right since you dont get very many in one bag and since about dont cook right you barely get any pork rinds and throw the rest away maybe i am not cooking them right but i followed the directions,does not heat up well
10339,not thrilled with this one threw most of it away for some reason the result ended up being gummy which is not something i expected from this type of product,ok but pork rinds should not be gummy
10340,first the good news yes these are really good br the bad news they are loaded with monosodium glutamate br of course this was not listed on amazon as one of br the ingredients br this is a good item if you are not sensitive to br msg br now i have to go to the and buy the fried pork br rinds to feed my addiction,aaaarrrrrgggghhhhh
10341,someone at work cooked these and the smell is now making everyone sick smells kinda like puke hopefully the smell does not last overnight not recommended,awful smell
10342,for starters i am not salt or msg averse i enjoy salty food like chips jerky and bacon however these pork rinds are ridiculously salty tasting to give you a better idea of what i am referring to kettle chips sea salt variety have mg of salt per oz of chips lowrey pork rinds have mg of sodium per oz serving that is roughly six times the salt content of a food considered relatively salty by most people i read a review on here saying that they were too salty and decided to order them anyway thinking the reviewer was some salt hating baby boy was i mistaken i wish i had not ordered these,unbearably salty
10343,terrible half of the rinds do not cook and the ones that do are gummy and shrink contacted lowrey about the defective product but they failed to respond,poor quality
10344,i had trouble finding just the right amount of time to microwave lowrey bacon curls microwave pork rinds and now that i have they are okay but i doubt i will buy them again i ruined quite a few in the process,lowrey bacon curls microwave pork rinds
10345,wow i had high hopes for a great addition to my low carb diet but these rinds were very disappointing tried several bags but could not get the cooking time right taste was dreadful texture downright rocky i guess i will stick to off the shelf rinds will not be getting these again cannot recommend and would warn of anyone asking for my opinion,never again
10346,i am having probs with the cooking they come out all fluffy and in seconds suck back into themselves and get all hard i have tried less time more time and cooking them out of the bag on a paper towel dunno what i am doing wrong and the company does not have any contact info as for the taste they re alright waay salty and i am a salt a holic br br i would not buy again,help
10347,i saw these on the food network channel and they made it sound so delicious on tv i only wanted to buy one or two packets to try but amazon only sells them in a big box they are light and crispy if they are popped correctly a little on the salty side because of the msg seasoning beware migraine sufferers not all of the bacon chips pop and you cannot eat the ones that do not because it is like plastic before they are nuked in the micro now i am stuck with the rest of the box,msg alert
10348,i expected better flavor is o k but half of the rinds do not puff up no matter what the timing in the microwave,disappointing
10349,these are very tasty for a quick snack but they are a little tricky to microwave each microwave oven cooks differently size and power wattage it takes a few packs to cook just right very easy to overcook or under cook and this effects the taste greatly after you learn the exact seconds for your microwave the better the taste if you overcook them they have a chemical like taste you might as well throw them away if not cooked just right i like to watch the bag cook for better results i take the bag out at the point of inflation no later or they will be over cooked at first i thought it would be like nuking popcorn but it is more difficult br br update we go through about boxes per month because we are on a low carb diet,tricky to nuke but great for low carb diets
10350,i have been looking for a site to order snow corn chowder formerly a new englander and now living in florida i cannot find my favorite chowder anywhere my whole family loves snow corn chowder and i promise to share with them if i can order a case would some one please look around and see if you can find one the florida fredericks would be most appreciative,snow corn chowder

10352,werthers is the best candy i ever tasted i have become addicted to it it is the only candy i eat,werthers orginalai
10353,my candy order came quickly packed well in a cardboard box all bags of the ounce size i was pleased that the candy had not gotten soft or sticky in transit as sometimes an order for the ounce bag will do the last bag of the has just been opened so as i was ordering another case i took a minute to write a quick note,my favorite
10354,yummy br this is a candy i have enjoyed since i was a child it reminds me of sitting on the front porch in the swing with my grandmother when i pop one of these little pieces of heaven into my mouth it brings back great memories of the days gone by,yummy
10355,we appreciate the availability of this coffee from you i order and it arrives quickly i am getting ready to place another order now my dept loves it,great coffee
10356,i had a recipe that called for a lot of dark chili powder and the only place i could find it was amazon com i bought a jar of this and it made two batches of the chili recipe i have the chili was the best i would ever made i can vouch that this chili powder really does make a big difference in the flavor of a chili it is rich with a bit of a kick everyone has been crazy for it and i think its due to this chili powder i am back to buy the bag this time,best chili powder i ever tried
10357,this chili is filling and mildly spicy cooks well however it makes exploding noises in my microwave,good chili
10358,keep box of saltines nearby and nuke this stuff and it is about the best lunch out of a microwave that i have ever had in my years of working br nice and thick no weird burnt spices mystery meat but they all have that br i will buy this again,good for workers w ten minute lunch breaks
10359,one of the disappointments with campbell chunky chili is that the meat is chewy and does not really taste like meat overall the chili is acceptable as a quick lunch alternative but do not expect anything resembling homemade chili,edible but not great
10360,campbell makes some great soups but their chili on the other hand leaves alot to be desired it tastes okay just not up to snuff i prefer hormel w or w out beans or even better homeade and i make a mean chili no compalints yet,i have to also agree star chili
10361,for a microwavable chili this stuff and the firehouse variant do taste good however i never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave i have followed the directions exactly on the label as well as tried some tweaking and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding br br the problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on it is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering irony is there is not enough venting the chili plugs the holes and as it boils and water vapor expands it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave br br i wish i could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess so far the firehouse variant has not exploded on me but it also has less meat and beans to it since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy i may just stick with that until campbells can make this not a bomb,tastes good at least
10362,i eat a variety of shelf stable microwavable lunches this is the best of the bunch to me it has good flavor and is well seasoned without being overly spicy it has grams of fiber and tastes good at the same time i prefer to eat it with saltines and shredded cheddar but have eaten it with only the saltines and enjoyed it br br i usually prefer chili without beans with hormel prefered and wolf brand as an alternate but i really like this chili soup with beans br br for thos who have trouble with the chili popping and banging turn the power level of the microwave down,my favorite shelf stable microwave lunch
10363,i think this chunky chili is the worst store bought chili the meat has the texture of artificial soybean meat and is chewy the br sauce is too sweet and cloy this has no character br br i prefer hormel or dennisons to this by far,barely edible
10364,i had never tried these before and wanted something different these turned out to be really good i even made some chili cheese fries that were really good will definitely buy again,good quick meal
10365,stars on taste beef tastes like it was grilled before it was added to the chili the only thing that concerns me is the grams of sugar that cannot be good for you,stars on taste
10366,campbell roadhouse best microwavable chili on the market used to be able to get it in local grocery stores but have not seen any there for a long time now do not know why glad to find it available on line just the right amount of spices lively flavor without trying to burn out your taste buds only good campbell lean meat used,best chili
10367,this chile was surprising good and not overly salty or processed tasting actually a good light and tasty lunch,good taste i will get more
10368,taste is not bad and there is plenty of beans and beef br too much sodium if you have high blood pressure this product is a no no,campbell chunky roadhouse beef bean chili
10369,for a microwavable meal it is great the meat is indeed a mystery but expected for the price if it had higher quality meat we would be complaining about the price increase for the product br if you are looking for a cheap quick alternative meal at work this works nicely add some sour cream and eat it alongside rice for a more fuller meal br i d prefer a home cooked chili but who has the time to shop prepare it when working over hr wk i have had worse chili in restaurants for much more br i just purchased campbell firehouse hot and spicy chili because i do prefer some heat will review them later this week when i receive my shipment,better than the other campbell soups
10370,when a beautiful young vixen from work offered to buy me lunch i was elated but at the time i was unaware she was not willing to spend more than three dollars so instead of going out we went to the store where i was unsure about which flavor soup to get she recommended the chunk chili with beans roadhouse style this was a delicious hearty meal and i certainly plan on buying it again partly to bring back that nostalgic moment of its purchase,best lunch ever
10371,when cooking according to instructions in microwave it keeps making popping noises and eventually it pops really loud and flies up and spills all over the place at about secs in my microwave wtf it has done it to me three times in a row then i tried it in my sisters microwave and had the same exact problem i am not sure this stuff is even safe,explodes in microwave
10372,works great i use it for years do not use it everyday though because it is strong br good to use fiber instead,good product
10373,i love chuckles so the temptation to buy some in bulk overtook my better judgement recently i do not know why but i was surprised to discover that each huge movie size box was mostly air and contained a small clear plastic wrapping with pieces of candy in it i am old enough to have fallen for this i ate them all quickly to quell my feelings of having been made an idiot out of yet again by air filled boxed nothingness chuckles is a great and classic candy but this packaging is quite deliberately deceptive and insulting i would shop for other packages at other sites should the chuckles urge overtake me yet again,great candy cheaters box
10374,i do not understand the bad review below the chuckles boxes come to ounces the chuckles bars are ounces at nearly twice the price that is right the boxes cost almost half as much br the boxes are big and inside the chuckles are in a plastic bag yes they are not evenly distributed oh well,great value big boxes
10375,my brother and i were talking about candy that we enjoyed as children i bought the chuckles theater boxes as a gift for him moist tasty and there is plenty to share the quantity may be too much for some but they always have a houseful of kids watching movies and eating snacks this is a great movie treat for all ages at a good value,great treat
10376,kind of a ripoff i bought the theater box instead of the piece candy bar version and that turned out to be a big mistake each box has only or pieces and they are randomly filled so you are not guaranteed even piece of each flavor one box had green pieces and black a better value is pack of the original piece bar this theater box is sold by weight oz and not volume the box is about empty ripoff,bigger box but not a good value
10377,i love chuckles br br and they are soooo hard to find damn you amazon for providing me a place to order them at will br br my new diet shot to hell br br,kookoo for chuckles
10378,i had a recipe that called for a lot of dark chili powder and the only place i could find it was amazon com i bought a jar of this and it made two batches of the chili recipe i have the chili was the best i would ever made i can vouch that this chili powder really does make a big difference in the flavor of a chili it is rich with a bit of a kick everyone has been crazy for it and i think its due to this chili powder i am back to buy the bag this time,best chili powder i ever tried
10379,wheat nuts are hard to find in the stores i was glad to find them on line i am very satisfied with the product and having received them quickly thankyou for such great service,wheat nuts from amazon
10380,compared to a health food store this amazon price is far a better value br br if you buy these i suggest that you keep them in the sealed jar i had put some in an open snack dish and they absorbed this awful humidity and lost their crunchiness br br otherwise love these as a snack,wheat nuts
10381,i ordered dried galangal root to make tom kha gai soup although the fresh root tastes better i ordered the dried root to have on hand it does the trick and the quality is great br tastepadthai shipped my order very fast when i opened the box i was surprised to find that they had also included a complimentary assortment of fresh thai herbs kaffir lime leaves lemon grass thai peppers and galangal how generous i will definitely shop with tastepadthai again,very impressed
10382,utz honey wheat braided pretzel twists are a great snack to keep on hand for a little guilt free munching they have a wonderful mild sweet and salty crunch with g trans fat no saturated fat and no cholesterol you will want to keep them on hand br br i absolutely love the packaging it is very convenient to put out when you have company over keeps leftovers fresh leftovers what leftovers and when you are all done it is great for storing sewing supplies little toys or even a jar to save change for a rainy day,awesomely good stuff
10383,love the product do not know why it is not on the shelf at sam anymore fast shipment,great product
10384,it is a low fat alternative to all the high calorie no good for you snacks that are on the market and in addition it is taste is very satisfying to say anymore would be gilding a lily,light snack
10385,guess what the shoprite brand braided twists honey wheat pretzels are the exact same thing they must use utz as a supplier for them there is no difference i promise so start saving and buy the shoprite ones at half price,shoprite brand
10386,these pretzels are so good i used to buy them in my local grocery store but they discontinued carrying them amazon came through and i thank them dearly these pretzels have the best flavor and crunch,hard to fine but worth the effort
10387,the amita peach nectar is a very tasty natural fruit drink that is loaded with sugar so if you are looking for an alternative to orange juice and can tolerate the calories you might want to give this drink a try also it makes a nice ingredient in mixed alcoholic beverages such as peach bellinis,tasty peach drink
10388,i ordered this bouquet for valentine day and was happy to see how great this arrangement looks once it blooms you should expect all the flowers to arrive unopened and they mostly bloomed in days i received stargazer lilies and irises the glass vase was simple but functional and attractive packets of plant nutrients were included and i expect the flowers will last at least a week days so far all i did was cut the flowers under running water and plop them in the vase with packet of food you could arrange them yourself for slightly better results,absolutely beautiful
10389,i was very disapointed with these flowers several of the stargazer buds were damaged as if they had been frozen and several others are such that they will not open very well although there is still time for them to improve perhaps but the number of flowers for the money was wholly inadequate on the bright side the iris are blooming nicely and are beautiful based on the condition of the stargazers and the inadequate number of stems however i do not think i will order from this company again,i am sad
10390,the stargazer lillies in this bouquet have an amazing scent that fills a room which the recepient told me was heavenly they live quite long when cared for properly but it is important to remember that these particular flowers ship in bud form on delivery day they are not like the picture on the page here but will reach that point in or days time take that into account and plan ahead br br the reason to choose this one over the standard version is the extra stems of the stargazer lillies because as i mentioned earlier the scent they carry is fantastic the more the merrier,a bit expensive but you do get what you pay for
10391,i pre ordered this product from proflowers through amazon two weeks ahead of mother day and was quite happy when it showed up today on the scheduled date it was delivered by fedex the flowers were slightly wilted from being out of water for the hours they were in transit but they perked right up after being put in water included in this package was a nice vase and packets of plant food br br keep in mind these are mostly buds and will take a day or two to fully open so you might want to have them delivered slightly in advance like i did br br the only possible negative i can think of is the fact i was not provided a tracking number by email to track the package but it did arrive on time and in good condition,budding flowers arrived on time
10392,this company is a sponsor of the rush limbaugh radio show this means that proflowers pays for and profits from mr limbaugh hate speechs against women and non caucasian people,beware
10393,frozen and fresh on arrival awsome tasting highly recomend this co the lobster tails were as advertized jumbo and tasty some of the best ive ever had,awsome lobster tails
10394,omaha steaks franks are really quite delicious but i could not find out what meats are put into them so i only buy them on rare occasions their web site is really geared for pure beef products with no explanations for products of multiple origins i know my sister has multiple gi problems but she can eat one of these every once in a while without a stomach upset she does complain of the salt content though if you do not care how these hotdogs are made then i highly recommend them for great flavor,delicious
10395,this is by far the yummiest maple syrup we have ever tried and we have tried many i am having trouble keeping my husband from over dosing on the stuff you can order without worry and be assured of a great product,super yummy
10396,this is a wonderful tasting syrup is great on pancakes as well as ham it is well worth the money,maple syrup
10397,this is a really nice rich tasting maple syrup those new to maple syrup should try the b grade because it has more authentic flavor and is thicker than the lighter grades goes farther on pancakes and in recipes too,excellent
10398,wow this really hurts me to do this but i have to give this syrup the lowest review it has gotten yet this was my first time ordering hidden springs vermont maple syrup and i did so because the other brands were not available in the half gallon variety i wanted to go with half gallon this time because i go through the oz containers too quick and the hidden springs maple syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk now to the bad part i usually purchase either the coombs family farms or highland sugarworks brands of maple syrup and i love their taste it was a bitter disappointment when i first tasted the hidden springs maple syrup and realized i would made a huge mistake br br i do not cook with these syrups i use them for one thing and one thing only pancakes waffles or french toast the aforementioned brands i usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products but the hidden springs maple syrup had a very funny off putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast do not get me wrong it is not nasty but in comparison to coombs or highlands it is terrible br br unfortunately i feel like i wasted on maple syrup as i now have about oz of hidden springs maple syrup that i will not eat perhaps it will make a good cooking syrup and i can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup but in summation if you are going to spend this much money on maple syrup buy coombs or highlands there is a reason they are the top purchased syrups on amazon,not for me
10399,thought i would take a chance on this as my grocery store does not know about maple syrup grades light amber is best price is beautiful grocery store charged as much for two ounce bottles as this whole quart shipping time was amazing super saver in days and yum reminded me that it is been years since i bought a pound box of maple sugar candy time to search again lt grin br forgor to mention definitely grade a fancy not grade b the cooking grade br a href http www amazon com gp product b hi e hidden springs maple vermont maple syrup quart fancy grade light amber a,good product good quality
10400,this is one of the very finest maple syrups i have ordered and enjoyed i bought the fancy grade for the light amber color it has a very great taste i will reorder,hidden springs maple syrup
10401,this is our second order from hidden springs for maple syrup for our b b if they continue with the great price and quick turnaround not to mention great syrup we will stay regular customers,nothing like vermont maple syrup
10402,hidden springs vermont maple syrup is excellent there is not anything on the label that states that this is from anywhere else but vermont some syrups that claim to be pure maple syrup also have labels that state that they may be a product of canada or vermont the price per oz is about cents and as i use at least one ounce on my waffles this bottle will last for about servings i will be buying this one again,can i give it stars
10403,my wife became spoiled when we were on a fall trip with the taste of light maple syrup it is not available in the south so she was very happy to find it from amazon com hidden springs is very high quality and have fast shipping thank you,top quality
10404,this fancy grade is as good as it gets you will not be disappointed this priouct supports the proud vermont tradition,vermont maple syrup at its best
10405,i ordered the grade b hidden springs syrup grade b is my favorite for baking i love the strong rich maple flavor this is my favorite amongst several maple syrups that i have ordered from amazon maple syrup is understandably expensive but this syrup is a good value among its competitors,rich maple flavor good value
10406,tastes great and it is a quality product at a price a few dollars cheaper than the alternatives even at our local supermarkets it is tough to find grade a medium amber syrup in pints i will probably just keep ordering these a few times a year,love the taste best bang for the buck maple syrup
10407,living on guam can at times leave much to be desired we were sitting here talking about when we visited our family in wisconsin and had some home made ice cream at an amish farm i remembered how good it tasted and i remembered i had some maple syrup ice cream while there sooooo i got on line and found this gallon price was not bad here at a local store a pint of real maple syrup will cost and it had free shipping i had it in a few days and made the ice cream right away by the way i also made pancakes and sausage for dinner and this here maple syrup was as good if not better than what i had years ago very well packaged and really fast shipping nice bouqet great light amber color great job to the cooker oh yea by the way the ice cream came out wonderfully,more please
10408,better than the medium or dark amber grades also would be a great gift go ahead and try it i use it on waffles with some butter,great maple syrup
10409,best maple syrup i have had im not a pro and bought some at cosco and threw out what was remaining when this arrived i literally have been putting it into a tablespoon and eating it this product is out of this world i hope the producers dont change a thing,wow
10410,this maple syrup is delicious and so flavorful did you know grade b maple syrup has so many vitamins and minerals you could almost not feel guilty about having french toast for breakfast i also try and use maple syrup where i can for sweetener instead of sugar the company was wonderful about the shipping and the product arrived packaged well and on time enjoy,maple syrup
10411,this is only the second time i have ever tried grade b maple syrup i liked this one better than now foods grade b i think it has more maple flavor i only give it stars because of lack of experience compared to others i think its priced well and it was shipped well i really love it on plain yogurt as well as pancakes and waffles would definetly buy again,very good syrup
10412,good price for the size i wanted and great quality it was just what i needed for a mead project items was delivered quickly,maple syrup
10413,we enjoy our maple syrup with waffles and pancakes on sundays this is a great product made in a small farm in vermont the syrup is natural and tasty no complaints here,yummm
10414,my husband and i are quite fussy about our maple syrup and we usually buy ours from canada we ran out and decided to try this one and what a surprise it was the grade a medium amber from hidden springs maple vermont is simply fabulous great and fast service,the best maple syrup
10415,not as good as the reviews led me to expect despite great color and good viscosity the syrup flavor lacked intensity i will continue my quest elsewhere,once is enough
10416,normally i buy the fruztio freeze dried apricots made by crispy green co and they are delicious but the store i was getting them from was out of stock for a very long time so i decided to try the cantaloupe since i like fresh cantaloupe how bad could they be br my only choice was a large multi pack bag so i forked up the money with high hopes i tore into the bag appreciating the single serve sized bags inside i opened one up and took a bite blech yuck these tasted like green under ripe canteloupe i was hoping for that super sweet i could eat this whole melon sort of flavor but no br these were so bad that i threw the whole multi pack away and that is saying a lot because i am very frugal with my food purchases i just knew i would never eat the rest of them wish i could give a better review but i can t br but i do recommend the apricots that i mentioned they are super flavorful and delicious if you love that tart apricot flavor,yuck
10417,in recent months i have become an amazon com prime fanatic why because you can buy a lot of good stuff cheap meaning cost effective and have it delivered in two days for free how can you hate that but beware br br as president reagan once said trust but verify i have actually corrected his intent because i think he was trying to be too politically correct that is distrust and verify you must always shop and reshop internet and retail to see what makes price sense br br to the point i can buy the oz lb bag of b j kona blend coffee beans in the decorative bag for no sales tax in ma at my local bj an aggressive amazon com marketplace seller is offering the same item for plus shipping total i will not dignify the sellers price by speculating what the profit margin might be or what the final unit price results in you be the judge all i can say again is distrust and verify br br p s i defend the right of a company to gouge their customers that is what capitalism and america are all about flip side is that others will see the gouging and decide to sell the same product for less money that is also capitalism and what we are all about br br i would encourage readers to comment on my opinion thank you,beware of overpriced items
10418,the coffee is overall ok i had to make it strong for it to taste good when made weak it was not very good my spouse did not like it however i made it personal taste i used whole beans in a breville youbrew grinder coffee maker i am glad that i tried it as kona blend is suppose to be very good three stars,just ok
10419,i have been drinking this tea for about months now i have noticed a drastic change in my skin i normally have really bad skin i started to drink this for a different reason and then noticed my skin cleared up in the process i will always drink this now i have tried so many things for my skin but this beats them all,this works clears skin
10420,buy it if you have problems with ance blesmishes bumps etc then you need to buy it it brightens your skin and smooths out the texture the amazing part is that you see immediate results by immediate i am talking about overnight drink it and you will wake up glowing with clear bright beauiful skin i have suffered from acne since i was years old at years old i can honeslty say this tea works beauiful miracles,makes your skin gorgeous
10421,i have begun to use this tea after doing three natural gallbladder liver cleanses and watching the stones come out like crazy when the doctors could not figure out why i had so much pain the cleanses have helped but i am now two days in using the tea and have absolutely seen a rise in energy i am hoping this continues the tea tastes great with added mint leaves i am still looking for a tea that also has milk thistle without chicory,post gall liver stones detox tea user
10422,this is such a good deal for this tea you get six boxes for less then twenty dollars well worth it because i love the mild taste and stomach soothing tendencies it has it is a great regular detox for the liver skin digestion and blood it is very good with the regular stevita here on amazon i will order this again before i hit my last box lt,i love this tea
10423,i have been using this for awhile now unfortunately the local stores where i used to buy this stopped carring it and i was able to find this deal on amazon i love this tea i think it tastes great i do prefer to drink herbal tea without much additions maybe a little organic cane sugar here and there or some almond milk or rice milk br br when i was drinking one of these tea bags every day i felt great as i noticed a feeling of well being it was like many different body systems were working as they should be i have been diagnosed with the genetic form of fatty liver and i have a lot of allergies this tea really helps me i take this tea in addition to the himalaya herbal healthcare livercare for liver support aka liv i take the livercare once daily by mouth between one of these tea bags daily and one pill by mouth of the livercare i feel great,great detox tea
10424,i was up visiting my family this week and was having the usual allergic reactions i get when i am here when we went out shopping we happened upon the local health foods supermarket and went inside br br i thought i could find a milk thistle tea that could help me none could be found i saw the triple leaf detox tea and figured it could not hurt so i bought br br i was amazed at how well it helped my allergic reactions have nearly gone away it has worked better than the any of the meds i have used to counter them previously,worked for my allergies
10425,bought a six pack of these and like using it from time to time it a natural way to detox please be advised start off easy with one cup then work up to two cups a day i usually do this for about days then go about or months without this tea and then repeat all natural,works great
10426,i have been having trouble w my skin lately and thought this tea might help i steeped one tea bag for a few minutes just to wet the leaves and then tore it open i combined the wet tea leaves w one teaspoon plain organic yogurt and spread the mix on my face i soaked a washcloth in the hot tea water and when it was cool enough placed it over my face and relaxed for min my skin feels so much better in just one application much less irritated and it feels moisturized and calm i highly recommend giving this a try for anyone who might have acne and have tried everything if you do not want the mess and might be having a breakout in just one small area simply place a warm teabag on your skin without removing the insides and let it sit for minutes of course drink the tea as well to cleanse from the inside out,incredible face mask too
10427,i started drinking this tea because i wanted to try something which would rid me of a persistent boil i was attracted by the word detox on the box i am on my second box br br this tea is easy on the tastebuds and i believe that it is working,so far it works for me
10428,i read many of the reviews and had mixed feelings about this product i am glad i decided to purchase it anyway the tea definitely cleanses you inside and out if you follow the packaging instructions plus it tastes great i will continue to purchase more when my supply runs low,does what it says
10429,this is one of the few teas that i will always have on hand it is a wonderful blend of beneficial herbs that has a great taste i drink it almost every day,good tasting tonic
10430,i was not expecting much from this tea after all there are literally dozens of products out there each day claiming to be magical cure all so does this detox tea work i have no medical training other than first aid but i will say that i do feel refreshed after drinking it i have tried it hot warm cold sweetened with honey and unsweetened the tea has a very light chai flavor to it which i enjoy but i have to say that around for bags about per bag that if you are not a fan of tea then i would have to say that this is not for you when you can go to the grocery store and buy plain old tea that also has detox properties to it for around for the same quantity but for something different from the usual which what i was looking for i have to say i am pleased,actually surprised that it is this good
10431,but this tea taste wonderful i would buy it for the taste alone it can also be purchased at wild by nature,do not know if i believe the hype
10432,i have used this tea for years off and on it taste great for a detox type tea and i like to use it when i am on a fast for a few days to help clean my body out it is one of the few things i allow myself to drink while fasting,excelent tea
10433,this is a great tea to drink twice a day to cleanse your digestive system recommend drinking once in the morning and once at night or after eating an unhealthy meal to eliminate the waste,great tea for cleansing
10434,i saw this tea from my friend room and asked for a couple she has the super slimming tea and the detox tea i usually combine the two it made me go to the bathroom more frequently than usual but i feel much relieved like more refreshed my pimples went away and my back acne is non existent the store in my area stopped selling this kind of brand sucks i have to purchased it on line now,fantastic
10435,thank you so much for offering one of my favorite products in a cheap bundled package great service and will buy again,great
10436,detox tea is good for helping to cleanse the body of most of the modern world fast paced living very good price and fast delivery would buy it again,detox tea
10437,really br this stuff is pure magic for chicken and pork br i ve added it to veggies french fries omg beans you name it br the perfect balance of sweet salt and spice,it is so good you will need to buy extra to sprinkle on the wife
10438,this rub is great stuff i have had several dishes that will absolutely become part of my weekly diet this rub completely enhances any type of potato sprinkle it on sweet potato fries or cubed new potatoes it adds tremendous flavor to chicken and ribs great for a variety of things mks,awesome rub
10439,i bought this based on the rave reviews posted previously but one of the main ingredients is msg there is gotta be a way to make a good bbq rub that is not loaded with the stuff which gives me and my wife nasty headaches,loaded with msg
10440,this is our family go to bbq spice we highly recommend it and have shared in many extended family stocking over the years,the best
10441,this makes frying chicken easy i have used this product for over years but it is not always available locally i was glad to find it on amazon it is also good for making ranch fries just dip the potato wedges in water and coat with this and fry perfect every time so is the chicken i make with it,used this product for many years and glad amazon carries it
10442,just put those in the fridge and have them with your coffee nothing beats that,best wafers out there
10443,this is a very good tea as far as teabags go traditionally loose tea is always better quality than teabag teas but this is the exception being organic as well as the least processed compared to other teas white tea is the least processed of all teas teabags impart a subtle paper flavor that loose teas are free of these bags are a cut above other teabagged teas the subtle teabag flavor is less of a factor in this instance and are an excellent choice in leu of saving money it took about six weeks to finally get delivered but it was worth the weight this one is a no brainer,this tea should get the nobel peace prize
10444,after reading the other reviews i am confused and do not think that anyone was talking about this tea sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea and do not have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on that being said this is a remarkable tea it delicious it is instant so you do not have to wait for it to steep and it is really good for you i just love the taste of this but then again i enjoy the uniquely bitter flavor of dong quai but this is not bitter it is yummy for those who do not know dong quai is considered to be ginseng for women beceause it is very high in vit b and helps to keep women from becoming anemic due the their monthly cycle it also is said to help regulate irregular periods when used on a daily basis that said this tea is special because it helps to draw one energy downwards and the red date adds to this effect in that red is the color of the st chakra in other words this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed and it is good for you and it tastes good and it is a snap to make so what is there to be quibbling about,such a special gem this one
10445,my household has this tea stocked up at all times not to say it is my favorite tea but it is my favorite day to day tea we tend to drink green tea for its health benefits and as green teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types a few notes you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea it does not have a whole lot of tolerance from crisp and delicious to overpowering and slightly off putting i guess i attribute that to the freshness of the tea i am not sure i have had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas while this tastes good when you get it right if you forget the cup for a few minutes it is not forgiving that said that is the only real drawback to this tea yes i have had teas i would rate five stars six if i could yes they also cost x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea bottom line if you drink a lot of tea this is a good brand to buy if you do not drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it i would look elsewhere,after at least a year drinking this tea some thoughts
10446,this tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor the bags come individually wrapped in foil packets it steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic i love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so the one thing i think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags i am usually not a fan of stevia to me it has a bitter aftertaste but it was not overwhelming here,good tea very gingery
10447,purchased this tea because of recommendation product arrived well packaged and quickly i am very pleased with this product and will purchase it again,tea
10448,i have tried this product before and i really love it the price is fair and i enjoy it,it is a good product
10449,i am sensitive to caffeine and supposedly the white teas have approx what black teas contain and about half of what the green teas contain this probably varies all over the place however often a decaf tea isn t if you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks i find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas my husband and i cannot tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it is astringent properties but we temper that with milk or cranberry juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered good both hot or iced looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the prince of peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable i hope they do not up the price just because everyone else white tea is higher i wish it was available in a loose tea too a smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas i had as a child and at chinese restaurants beats anything i can buy in local supermarkets br br i did try the organic version and no way this one is better for some reason stronger and overall a better product even the bag it self is better than the organic,good tea wish it came in loose tea too
10450,the tea is good and fresh we enjoy it the shipping is fast and cost is reasonable br i recommend this product,good tea
10451,you get enough in each package to make a good size cup of drink it is consistent in its flavor and the amount you get in each packet i have purchased it a couple of times,nice product
10452,if you do not have the time to cut up ginger and boil it for it is wonderful flavor here is an alternative this tea is refreshing true ginger flavor and punch is wonderful,great herbal tea
10453,gold prince has made a terrible mistake there are two products coldaid and fluaid they are different formulary unfortunately they display fluaid picture on the amazon website and their own website but the words are coldaid there is a separate product for coldaid regardless if you order the fluaid on amazon you will get the coldaid the picture is not the product the words under the drop down menu are worthless as they all default to the same product coldaid if you want fluaid which is the superior product do not buy it from amazon or off of the sellers website it is a mistake http www amazon com gp product b p uk ref cm cr rev prod title,wrong product wrong name
10454,i found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket for one box of opposed to boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting i would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea i am not a pu erh expert and i am looking for something as authentic as i can get without paying an arm and a leg can anyone suggest a good quality the only reason i gave this a is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of,bought at my local supermarket
10455,i used quotes around the word tea because i doubt that the bags contain tea i would not be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea i would not give this product a single star it deserves zero stars in my opinion br this tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star,the worst tea i have ever tried
10456,i wanted a candy that would last me more than seconds and would not double my weight over the course of eating it caramel apple pops fit the bill perfectly calories and they last long enough to satisfy my sweet tooth br br i went looking for these in local grocery stores and could not find them but luckily amazon saved the day the pops came in the packaging that is shown in the picture but as another reviewer pointed out they look like they were home made the pops vary in size shape and mixture however it did not really bother me and unless you need perfectly shaped pops with just the right combination of caramel and hard candy i doubt it will bother you either br br overall highly recommended just wish stores would start carrying these again br br btw here is the nutrition information in case you want it br calories total fat g sodium mg total carbs g sugars g calcium,delicious worth the money
10457,i have been searching in the grocery store for these caramel pops for ages i used to suck on the during my kids sporting events as good as i remembered them,my favorite candy of all time
10458,these are my favorites and i have reordered more than once perfect for desert without all the calories and is soooo good cant find these locally so go to amazon for my candy fix,tastes like the real thing
10459,these were local during halloween and then we could not find them of course they were here at amazon they look like they were made in your kitchen as they are not uniform in shape or size but they are amazingly good it is like going to the fair and getting a tart green apple covered in yummy caramel they last a really long time which is good as they are calories each but they stop me from wanting a calorie desert so they are a good deal i do find myself smiling while i have one they make you feel like a kid a href http www amazon com gp product b dnjtqi tootsie roll caramel apple pops count a,suckers that can actually make you happy that good
10460,i ordered this product thinking it was going to come in a box of as it is described in the product description i was a little unsure of whether or not this could be too good to be true but when i saw that the weight of the item was marked as lbs and the shipping handling was i felt pretty confident that i would be receiving the count box that i thought this to be when i received the package there was only one bone in it so pretty much i spent on one bone that i could have gotten at the store for dont make the same mistake as me very poor product description by ozbo,inaccurate product description
10461,it is wonderful never had a flower yet i just love the leaves may i accidentally dropped it broke of its good leaves as it hit the floor but it grew right back this is what makes me so happy i was so scared it would die on me but no this beauty came up with more leaves lol love it just awesome plant you need fertilizer and good soil for these kinds of plants it all depends on what you have as a soil starting stuff,i believe this is the one i baught
10462,bel paese cheese is an excellent soft italian cream cheese these medallions arrived in excellent condition and were allowed to rest for a day under refrigeration the taste while a bit bland was very good and was spreadable on water wafer crackers the ordering process through amazon com was a troubling and difficult to complete but the shipping was relatively quick i would recommend this product,bel paese cheese medallions
10463,it is now degrees here so i am leery of ordering the cheese but it is excellent and i will be ordering it as soon as it hits the,excellent
10464,the coffee was send quickly it was satisfactory but not as good as other mocha java coffees i have tasted perhaps because i now have to stick to decafe the company sent a sample of decafe costa rican coffee which was very good,ok
10465,i am in love with this product not only me but also my month old twin boys eat it almost everyday for breakfast my parents my niece my sister and her boyfriend all love it as well so as you can probably tell by now this is really a delicious cereal also i know that i am eating something that is good healthy and organic for me usually i will eat it with soymilk and some fruit and it keeps me full and satisfied for a very long time my household will never run out of it i hope that you always keep this product in stock cause we cannot live without it,love love love my nature path granola
10466,costco stopped carrying this near me so when i found out it was on amazon for cheaper i was so excited br br it came pretty quick was at an unbeatable price and was the same good hot cereal i got from the costco no damage or anything,awesome price good product
10467,i purchased this pumpkin flax granola from amazon and could not be happier i actually take it dry everywhere i go br it makes an excellent snack i am anxious to try all the granola now the omega are high what better way to get them and it does not take much to satisfy a sweet tooth either the granola has just enough sweetness to satisfy any cravings and is healthy too a win win,excellent breakfast granola and snack
10468,i really like this granola their hemp granola is my favorite really good stuff however it is just too sweet for my taste most granola is dreadfully sugar laden and other than the healthy ingredients i feel like i am chomping on some commercial grade grocery store sugar cereal br br that said the texture is very satisfying and it is tasty just a bit sweet you have been warned,too sweet
10469,good stuff and i like the fact that buying like this results in much less packaging,nature path organic flax plus granola with pumkin seeds
10470,found this cereal at costco originally was happy to see it here on amazon been eating this every morning for two years and it still tastes great very healthy,delish healthy pumpkin seed cereal great
10471,this cereal is loved by everyone in the house as well as anyone who comes to visit even my year old and year old nephew the best price is on the subscription order costco used to carry then quit and i found on here was by far the cheapest price once in a while you can get a coupon for other places but for all time price is here br br the cereal is loaded with the omega you need as well as the fiber br br you cannot go wrong but watch out you will be hooked,best cereal ever best deal on subscrition order
10472,i have been receiving this product from amazon for more than a year from amazon because i cannot buyit around here not only does it taste good the flaxseed and pumpkin seeds have helped me raise my good cholesteral,granola plus flax and pumpkin seeds
10473,i usually order this item from amazon since our local grocery stores walmart and safeway do not carry it but i would expect that buying in bulk would be cheaper but instead six bags of ounces is eight cents per ounce more expensive than buying six boxes of ounces should not it be the other way around this is not a savings at all,yes it is good but
10474,this cereal is good and will get you full and satiated it is best mixed with a lighter cereal otherwise it is too hearty and heavy,good and hearty cereal
10475,i have probably ordered three cases of this stuff and eat it several days a week for breakfast great stuff minimal packaging minimal waste,excellent breakfast
10476,this is the best tasting cereal i have ever had in my entire life we eat it nearly every day for breakfast usually adding a half a banana and some chopped up walnuts some of my family even put blueberries on it i would never do that i occasionally buy it at sam or costco usually while traveling but it ends up cheaper here at amazon especially with the wonderful subscribe and save option my shipments magically arrive one thing to note you must keep your granola refrigerated to make it last especially if you buy this pack the oils will go rancid if you store it in a warm location this goes for nuts and seeds too,i love this cereal
10477,i eat a mix of this along with the asin b e alf nature path organic heritage flakes cereal ounce bags nearly every morning this is good healthy food unlike the popular sugary cereals most americans eat i enjoy the taste and it does not leave me starving by mid morning the price is also more reasonable when i buy it by the case,quality product real food
10478,my family loves this granola whether sprinkling it on their yogurt or eating it in a bowl with milk it has a great taste the ounce bags are an excellent value,great product
10479,product arrived undamaged and quicker than expected it is fresh and excellent when stirred into plain greek yogurt for a break time snack,delicious
10480,this is a great cereal if you are looking for a variety of textures and high fiber we love it,great item
10481,this granola is full of flavor delightfully crunchy without shredding your mouth and a very good value for your money my husband whose favorite cereal is count chocula likes it and has been eating it every day cannot think of a thing they should change,absolutely the best granola
10482,pros flax seeds organic fiber pumpkin seeds taste br cons price br br yum i used to avoid granola cereals because they were hard to chew a friend visited brought a box of nature path pumpkin flax granola and forgot to take it when he left so i tried it i was hooked immediately not only was it tasty but it was not jaw breaking hard it was not mush either perfection br br the only problem with this cereal is the price for someone on a fixed income trying to eat right it is expensive it is hard to find it for less than box and that is just too much for me to spend on a small box of cereal i bought this bulk package from amazon when it was on a super sale but on accident i did not hit auto renew and the price went back up when it goes back down i will renew but until then it is other places that are cheaper these are fred meyer in bulk and trader joe box the best price is fred meyer br br make sure that you chew the cereal good the flax seeds are whole if they enter the body whole they exit whole as well and that means you get zero nutrient from them so chew it up br br it excellent with so delicious coconut milk a non dairy non soy drink i just use it for this cereal i have stomach problems and this combo is one of the few things during the day that does not ache me,excellent organic granola cereal for all
10483,my husband and i eat this cereal almost every day probably five out of seven and have it delivered via subscription for me personally it is a tad on the sweet side so i often add about one part generic rice krispies to about four parts granola and mix them in a large tupperware container that maintains the nice light but crispy texture,our standard breakfast
10484,nature path makes some excellent cereals and this is definitely one of them i really enjoy it because it has great flavor a good crunch and is a very healthy food in fact this is my favorite cereal hands down i totally recommend buying the pack of a penny saved is a penny earned besides it is not like the cereal is going to go bad it will keep for months until you break the seal,this cereal is great nutritionally is really tasty and is a great buy
10485,best granola cereal i have ever eaten you do not have to soak it before eating lol,nature path granola cereal
10486,love this cereal but i buy a oz box at costco for and sometimes am offered it with a box coupon its too high here,too expensive
10487,definite an auto delivery item plus nature path is one of the companies have not been bought by large companies like silk has been bought by dean,very good
10488,i thought it might not be a great idea to buy meat through the mail but it turned out great i love gyros and thought why not order from amazon at least that would make me feel better about the whole idea my order was delivered in days it would have been but we had a storm and the driver could not get here it was fabulaously packed with ice packs that we could reuse the gyros taste great and are pretty conveniet it makes a great and easy lunch i will definatly order this again and again,happy now
10489,i recieved the delivery quicker than i thought i would i was concerned with how the food item would be packaged the gyro slices were still frozen when i recieved them the gyro slices were delicious they taste better than most of the restaurants i frequent,qick delivery and tastes good too
10490,i love a good gyro i order this meat all the time and it never let us me down some good pita bread lettuce tomato and any other veggie you like will make a great lunch,yippy gyro
10491,a href http www amazon com gp product b lrijc gyro meat loaf approx lb a br finally i can enjoy gyros at home without going out with gasoline pushing five dollars a gallon it is nice to know that this gourmet food is just a few feet away in the ice box br now how about greek olives and feta cheese so we can have a nice greek salad with our gyro,gyro lover
10492,we have bought this gyro meat several times it is good and since we do not have a greek deli for almost miles it is as good as we can get for now my problem is the shipping yes it has to go by next day air that is fine but we would buy or loafs if they would combine shipping but they do not it is loaf shipping i know it does not cost much more to send as it does other than that it is good meat br br note this is the sliced version it is sliced very thin too thin for my tastes but others love it i prefer to buy the load and carve thicker pieces br br either way it is good but we can only afford it for special occasions due to the price of shipping and the lack of combining shipping options they really need to add this item to prime program,the meat is very good but there is no break on shipping
10493,the pounds of sliced meat itself are contained in a single cardboard box no vacuum seal or even plastic wrap that box is placed in another box that is lined with styrofoam sides styrofoam peanuts and three frozen ice paks it was shipped fedex day that what the label says not overnight or next business day which begs the question what exactly did the in shipping charges for lbs of meat and minimal packing materials actually go towards i think i know and it was not shipping br br years ago grecian delight the brand on the box was sold in a local supermarket chain in gyro kit boxes each contained a pack of sliced gyro meat one pita and a small container of tzatziki sauce i loved them but i have not seen the kits in decades and was happy to find a way to once again stock the freezer with gyros in waiting br br the gyro meat itself which i have ordered before tastes just like gyro meat as i said i love gyros but there is no place nearby where i can drop in and enjoy one so i have ordered the product in the past but in this case i have ordered for the last time br br i ve gotten the individual lb vacuum packets before at a time and they have arrived frozen or nearly frozen not so this box the meat was not only thawed it was only slightly cool i am afraid i am going to be throwing it out too risky for shipping charges it should have arrived in perfect condition overnight i will not make this mistake again i cannot afford to,have ordered before but this shipment was unusable
10494,the meat has some flavor i feel it could have a little more and also the slices are very thin so they burn quick if you dont pay attention the cucumber sause from the same place is amazing though,not the best not the worst
10495,i love a great gyros platter but there are not many greek restaurants pizzarias where i live so i was excited to see this offered here the meat was still frozen when it arrived and the styrofoam lined shipping box can be reused ice packs and all i bought it pre sliced and the slices separate easily from each other in the box so you can keep it frozen and just use a little at a time my only complaint is that i like thicker slices but in terms of flavor well i challenge you to make it at home yourself and have it taste this good i have a feeling i will keep a box of this on hand from now on one note the box does not contain heating instructions i tried it in the broiler and over browned it i wish i had read the instructions here before that first attempt,gyros anytime
10496,forgot expedited delivery and it is hot here in the south but the meat was cool and still very good the cucumber sauce is a great addition i did not have any pita bread but this is still great on white dollar rolls sub rolls or wheat bread cannot wait to try it on pita bread tonight highly recommended,great stuff completely satisfied
10497,i have been researching the web to find some gyro strips and this is the most expensive so far maybe look elsewhere,not cheap
10498,let us face it if you have no willpower can t limit yourself to eating of a normal sized bag of microwave popcorn and hate to shop at your local store prime eligible point click to porch does not get better good price it is not homemade but it fills the craving what more can you ask for that has only calories,popcorn for the lazy who hate to shop
10499,i really like this product but have not seen it around for awhile i am glad amazon carries it it has the most buttery taste of all the calorie popcorns out there very little unpopped kernels perfect serving size bags,best calorie popcorn
10500,i love this popcorn i like popcorn very much but i usually eat too much of it i keep these bags at work for when i want a snack if i had the big bags i would eat the whole thing these are perfect it seems like you get a big pile of popcorn but know you still are okay with calories compared to a candy bar or even hershey kisses i have tried other calorie things and it is like you get some pitiful amount but the popcorn seems like a real treat br br i see it is currently out of stock and not available for subscribe and save i hope they get more because it is really the most tasty buttery flavored of the brands i have tried,amazon do not stop selling this
10501,great popcorn and a lot for calories tastes great just about every kernel pops and it is not too salty i will surely purchase this again and would recommend it for anyone who likes great popcorn and wants portion control too,they all pop
10502,pop secret is by far my favorite popcorn and i eat about bags a day i normally get the homestyle but is was always to dry when i ordered on line so i went to the butter thinking it would not be so dry no such luck when i buy from the grocery store it is much more flavorable and fresh and it does not cost that much more i checked the dates and the store vs online bulk was about months different on average which probably causes the difference even though they both are in the sale by date range with this said i am going to have to discontinue buying this product online unless something changes and i will really miss it coming straight to my door since i eat so much i waited for months of getting this product before posting because any company can have a bad batch of anything sorry i hope this changes in the future,cheaper price but popcorn older and stale
10503,these are smaller bags of popcorn that are equal to about half of a normal sized bag i would prefer the normal sized packs,small bags
10504,we like pop secret calorie pop corn the taste is good takes about one and a half minutes to pop and there is about cups of popped corn pretty good snack and just calories good buy and price here on amazon,calorie pop corn
10505,could have been more buttery but otherwise a great popcorn for calories it seemed to be larger than other calorie popcorn bags,more butter please
10506,excellent product great taste perfect portion br br only calories in a bag i microwave it for and it comes out perfect each time br br fills a medium tupperware bowl br br and it was an very good value only for boxes shipped only cents for each bag,excellent product great taste perfect portion
10507,our deployed troops love this treat as it reminds them of home a very popular connection from home during down times,treat from home
10508,ok lets start of by saying that my microwave is not very good for popcorn but in my local grocery store i can buy market pantry popcorn for for large bags and not all the pop corn kernels pop but very yummy and i went through boxes in less than a month but then we have this one pop secret and my first bags burnt and was not happy so i decided not to follow the instructions so i decided to put microwave at minutes and let it stop when it got to sec ok so it did not burnt it but due to me not placing it microwave on high it took a very long time to cook it and so anyway it began to pop and so i thought great at least no burnt popcorn and i was so excited and hungry to try it due to the ratings on this site i began to eat it and my first reaction was oh my good ness dry dry where is the butter its called butter pop corn so where is the butter did it get all dryed up in microwave,dry needs more butter
10509,months later and i still have more box after giving away the other two boxes lol there is no taste in butter and although it is a reasonable price it is too simple no flavor and you can sometimes get burned popcorn even though the same timing worked for the same package and the same microwave so never leave your popcorn unattended,nothing amazing about it
10510,perfect bland of spices this is a wonderful curry powder and the quanity is generous it has lasted me a long time,love it
10511,i am not generally a fan of starbucks regular coffee or most coffee for that matter but this is delicious light and flavorful not grainy at all i only add skim milk and yet it is creamy and sweet i wish they made the blonde in decaf too,delicious
10512,i was placed on a severly restricted sodium diet three years ago and one day at my local market happened upon this product it was like i finally had stepped back into the world of taste if you have ever read nutrition labels on soups you know a sodium restricted diet does not allow for the vast majority of them so now i can have a healthy organic warm bowl of comforting soup whenever i like and if i purchase it through amazon by the case shipping is free making it a lot less expensive then my local market give it a try,finally taste
10513,this soup is very very sweet they left out the salt but it is full of sugar there is grams of sugar per serving with two servings in a can too sweet for me also there is dairy butter in it so it is not vegan or for someone with dairy allergies,not a vegan soup
10514,this would be a great soup if health valley lowered the sugar content at least in half or more the company took the health out of the valley with this soup when one buys a no salt soup they are doing so for health reasons if one is watching their salt intake they are also in most cases concerned about their sugar intake i buy health valley no salt soups because they are organic no or little salt and yes low in sugar grams of sugar is shameful they do a good job with their no salt soups except with their tomato soup fix it health valley use carrots as a sweetener give it some thought,why so much sugar
10515,this is awful so i got out the pots and pans and made a great no salt little sugar and no butter fat tomato soup using fresh tomatoes tastes much much better than this tomato soup,yucky and way too sweet
10516,this is for the health valley tomato soup no salt added ounce cans pack of i purchased this specifically for a person with heart problems one of the problems with canned foods is too much sodium so the no salt added is a good feature another problem is cholesterol content the ad for this product states mg cholesterol which is a false statement apparently the supplier did not update the ad when health valley changed their recipe for their no salt tomato soup and is now adding cholesterol the cans i received have a new on the label which the can shown in the ad does not this is an honest mistake on the seller part but he should correct it and he should list the true contents,no salt soup ad says no cholesterol the facts are different
10517,my husband had a stroke and needed no salt products to keep his blood pressure down br health valley no salt soups are great they have low sodium and also taste great,health valley tomato soup no salt added
10518,i am on a low sodium diet and this still has plenty of taste without salt,good taste
10519,this is not the product i received they changed the product it now has chunks of tomato in the soup this is not what i wanted,soup not as pictured
10520,i love this soup i have right sided heart failure and need to watch my salt intake this soup is as close to tomato bisque by campbell as you can possibly get you need to try this,wonderful heart healthy soup
10521,since i have to watch my sodium i have looked for a very low sodium soup for quite awhile campbell made one but no longer does if you had tried theirs this one is far tastier and better,very tasty
10522,hard to find at my local grocery and amazon has a deal on cans that come periodically throughout the year great idea,love this soup
10523,actually i cannot remember a time when i tasted anything so bad i really could not believe it was meant to be eaten cannot imagine anyone liking this it did give me a good example for my daughter why it is important for her to take her health seriously,grotesque maybe i got a bd can but ick
10524,this is a good alternative to pasta sauces if you are supposed to lower your salt intake spaghetti lasagna etc,nice pasta sauce for low salt
10525,my husband and i love this i usually caramelize walla walla sweet onions to mix in the cooked product we have also added sauteed zucchini and chopped fresh tomatoes i do not feel deprived being on a gluten free diet when i can indulge in this and no it is not mac and cheese and i do not believe it is meant to be,we love this
10526,i bought say cheez on a whim i am vegan and usually only use road end products to fulfil my kraft kravings cravings it is definitely not like kraft nor road end but there is something distinctly cheese like about it and i found it to be delicious i added both peas and broccoli and was pleasantly suprised to find that the cheese sauce was plentiful enough for all of the pasta peas and broc i also must say as my first time trying to cook gluten free pasta on my own this was painless and did not crumble apart like it could have i gave it stars not quite perfect but definitely a great treat every once in awhile for those of us on a budget,not kraft but delicious different
10527,this smelled so good it drew a crowd in my newly wheat free kitchen everyone liked it from it is not the creamy kraft mac and cheese but it has a great smell and flavor and we came back and bought more,need to eat
10528,my daughter has a severe allergy to dairy so we have tried a couple of products trying to get close to macaroni and cheese this was very easy to prepare and while there was not a creamy sauce the spice packet was very tasty my picky but food allergic year old as well as my husband and i really enjoyed this product i got online today specifically to order this product,not mac n cheese but very good
10529,i received this product for free and was quite excited to try it out i have a child who has a variety of food intolerances and namaste brand products have been a godsend to our family unfortunately this say cheez product is terrible and my child would not touch it normally this is not a problem when my child tries new foods but i could not even stomach it it is nothing like mac cheese the sauce is not even creamy very disappointing,definitely not mac cheese not even close
10530,after trying the namaste pizza crust i was blown away delicous possibly the best pizza crust i have ever had so i tried their cheez pasta thinking it would be great as well big surprise it was awful i could barely tolerate one bite of it i like one of the other reviewers will save the pasta but make my own cheese sauce the cheese sauce smelled and looked terrible do not waste your money on this product,do not waste your money
10531,a href http www amazon com gp product b lkxg w namaste foods gluten free say cheez pasta dish ounce bags pack of a br br my sons are die hard boxed mac n cheese addicts but i recently discovered that keeping one of them off of gluten and casein really helps him out he is hyperlexic i tried this not really expecting the kids to like it but it was a hit i was so in love with the aroma that i ate a serving myself something i do not usually do when i make boxed mac n cheese i still like my own recipe for vegan cheese sauce better but this will be great for a time pinch or for the babysitter to prepare not exactly like kraft or even annie or back to nature but delicious in its own right five stars,amazing delicous better than i expected
10532,my year old daughter has alot of food allergies two of them are gluten and milk this is as close to mac and cheese that we have found we both thought it was very good we added tuna to it we will definitly be buying more keep adding new products to your line,very good
10533,my son was recently diagnosed as having food sensitivities to wheat and especially to milk cheese not having mac and cheese his favorite food was especially hard we tried some other products but the general consensus was they tasted like cardboard when we tried this the whole family loved it it does not really taste like mac and cheese but tastes great non the less,say cheese great
10534,love getting something new for my diet tried it plain then added cubed chicken and broccoli it was really good everything i have tried from namaste has been wonderful keep coming up with new things br elinor in kennewick wa a href http www amazon com gp product b lkxg w namaste foods gluten free say cheez pasta dish ounce bags pack of a,great with chicken and broccoli
10535,i really like this namaste foods say cheez gluten free vegan macaroni and cheese style dinner it is not kraft mac cheese but i like it a lot better than kraft it is zesty and peppery and it does taste like cheese br br i thought that the tablespoons of oil they say to mix the cheez sauce with was excessive i used one teaspoon of oil and cup of the cooking water i reserved from the pasta and let it simmer while stirring for a few minutes to thicken then i added the pasta and green beans that i cooked with the pasta it was really tasty the macaroni which was a nice texture and cooked up beautifully has ridges to hold the sauce do not over cook the pasta though it needs maybe or minutes br br it just way too expensive i really think namaste foods could make money and still price this much better to be affordable for the average person no need to price gouge people who have food sensitivities and parents who have children with celiac disease i know this type of product costs more to produce because of the need for a dedicated facility and the special ingredients but your prices are ridiculous br br most families are on a strict budget especially in these days of poor economy and job losses even on subscribe save this product was almost a bag come on namaste foods you do not understand the meaning of namaste if you charge such exorbitant prices,over priced but really good
10536,when we found out my daughter has celiac disease we were on the hunt for a reasonable mac cheese we tried everything we could fine this was one of the worst the cheese flavor was pretty bad i took one bite and had to spit it out my daughter did not like it either i am keeping a spreadsheet of items we tried so we do not waste our money on it again in the future the best mac cheese we found was annie rice pasta and cheese,just nasty
10537,this is a great product for those who need gluten dairy casein free foods br br of course it does not taste like real macaroni and cheese geez do you really think shelled hemp nuts and other things are going to give you a creamy cheesey texture or taste if you are looking for something to replicate annies gf mac and cheese which does contain dairy then you will search in vain you cannot get real cheese flavor from non cheese products br br however if you are realistic and are aware that non cheese stuff will not actually taste like cheese yet you want something similar to mac cheese then this is a great option we really like this mix it has a unique taste we tend to alternate this stuff with road end organics gf cheddar penne chreese a href http www amazon com gp product b fjyczs road end organics gf cheddar penne chreese oz pack of a the road end is closer to cheese but again those who want a real cheese flavor consistency will be sorely disappointed however for those of us who cannot have real cheese this stuff is great br br we mix in veggies with ours you know the ones that are little squares of carrots peas corn etc and i use hemp milk when mixing for a bit more substance and flavor also if you add a bit of trocomare a href http www amazon com gp product b ell fa a vogel trocomare organic spicy herb seasoning salt ounce canisters pack of a it makes a huge difference in flavor actually trocomare makes a huge difference in the flavor of everything we love it and use it on just about everything br br so for those who expect a real cheese flavor do not even bother and stick with real cheese or change your expectations br br for those who realize it will not taste like real cheese but who want something different and unique and gluten dairy casein free buy this it is great,unique different great gf alternative to mac cheese
10538,i thought this would be a good gluten free replacement for annie mac n cheese but this was not really macaroni and cheese the sauce was not smooth and was spicy not hot spicy but strong flavored spicy my kids were appalled by it and while my husband and i could eat it we did not really like it since i bought a case we threw away the rest of the spice packets and made our own cheese blend for the rest of the pasta i would suggest trying one bag from a local store first if you can otherwise be aware that you may just be buying expensive pasta with useless spice packets if your family does not like this unusual flavor,not macaroni and cheese
10539,even though it does not taste exactly like regular mac n cheese it is a very tasty product my child who has many food allergies was extremely excited to be able to eat mac n cheese again it is very delicious we have made it many times it packs well in a thermos for lunch,this is delicious
10540,suprisingly i love this pasta dish when it comes to vegan macaroni and cheez products some are delicious and others are totally not well at first i was not sure about this one but as soon as i looked at the ingredients list and recognized every item and seasoning i instantly became comfortable with the idea of this being edible turmeric onion powder garlic powder rice milk powder etc this may not be macaroni and cheez but namaste is a great tasting pasta meal so im glad i chose to try it because i love it and maybe you will too,thank you namaste
10541,i am about months in to my transition to becomming vegan every once in a while i think of something that i miss all week i was craving mac and cheese but since i stopped eating the meat and dairy my body has stopped knowing how to process those foods soooo i could not cheat and eat mac and cheese i was in the gluten free aisle at central market searching for pastas when i stumbled upon this i took it home and after about minutes of my husband picking on me i tried it out ooooh eeeeem gheeee was it incredible br i even stuffed some in my husband mouth he promptly requested more to which i replied absolutely not br i had to come on amazon and buy a whole set so going forward i am never without br seriously the best mac and cheese i have ever had,should have a star option
10542,if you are looking for a good pasta alternative this one is great if you are looking for a mac cheese replacement keep looking we are celiacs who have caesin intollerance so our taste have changed over the years this is a very healthy yummy alternative for those living a minimally processed lifestyle it does not have a cheese taste we ate it mixed with broccoli my year old and his little buddy had child sized helpings they have not had much grain recently and demolished everything on their plates i added the little bit leftover to my evening salad for a different texture was still very tasty,my toddler and i love this
10543,i eat this all the time it is so good even though it says cheese it is actually dairy free but the taste is just superb,namaste cheez pasta
10544,just tried this for the first time today to be honest it is been years since i have had a real mac and cheese from the box however i thought this was great i adjusted the ratio for the sauce using tablespoon of oil instead of tablespoons of water and adding heaping tablespoon of tofutti sour cream to powdered sauce mixture this worked great for me and made it seem much creamier than i had expected from other reviews i also kept out a little of the starchy pasta liquid before i drained it to help coat the pasta with the sauce added in some cooked chicken fresh tomato and parsley it was delicious i will definitely do this again,great option for allergy sufferers
10545,my year old is on the gfcf diet and is picky this is definitely not mac cheese but the flavor is similar and he gobbled it up he can have ghee because it is casein free i think that made a big difference in the flavor i am happy to have another thermos meal for his school lunches,thumbs up from the kid
10546,the first time i tried this i thought it was beyond hideous i was expecting something that tasted vaguely like pasta with cheese sauce i had only recently developed a total dairy intolerance on top of the gluten problem so was having very bad experiences with cheez cheese subsitutes every one i have tried has been uniformly hideous so it is not like i had high hopes for this dish it is not even remotely cheese like or even cheez like and hoping for something that tastes within screaming distance of cheese messes up one expectations something awful however i found if i approach this dish after erasing all thoughts of cheesishness from my mind tastebuds it is quite good actually describing the taste is a bit of a challenge it got tons of flavor not hot spicy but turmeric onion garlic paprica butterish something maybe it is the hemp seed that gives it the indescribable yumminess i cannot begin to compare with anything i am familiar with whatever the heck it is i find myself madly craving it quite often br br as it comes out of the package it is not creamy at all though one can up the creaminess by adding whatever milk substitute you prefer i have also added fake cream cheese to it with decent creamy results br br still i wish they would get rid of the cheeselike claims call it something else it seems to me it would better prepare folks for liking it thus increasing the sales thus bringing down the price which is my main complaint with this all the namaste foods i really feel like too often those of us with real severe dietary restrictions who have no choice in a specialty diet as opposed to those who are going gluten free as a way of jumping on a fad bandwagon are being budgetarily scr er shafted by specialty food makers br br if anyone has been introduced to cincinnati chili as an adult without adequate prior preparation the shock experience of this pasta mix is something akin to that i grew up on cinci chili have a lifelong addiction but if you approach it expecting something like good ole texas chili with meat n tomato n beans your taste buds are in for one heckuva shock those with no preconceived notions frequently love the stuff but it is very very different from traditional chili having been concocted by greeks,great as long as you completely forget about cheese
10547,i bought this because i am vegan and not because the product is gluten free the only other vegan mac n cheese substitute i have found tried are the roads end products my husband is hard to please when it comes to vegan cheese and he hated the roads end stuff but loved this i do too it way better than roads end stuff it has a delicious flavor that is not at all spicy also much easier to mix up than the roads end br br not that expensive at all i will definitely be buying more love it br br btw the people adding tuna and chicken are missing the point of eating a vegan meal,delicious
10548,these beans are a good find as none of our local stores carry any dried pink beans,good quality
10549,this was a great sampler of green coffee to roast i have not tried them all yet but i liked the variety of regions and it really was a great product for a great price,fantastic
10550,i have purchased green coffee beans from several local and internet providers often with poor results u roast em is the exception i have never had bad service with this company and now purchase all of my coffee from them they provide an excellent selection of high quality beans at great prices they do a great job with packaging and shipping most of my orders have shipped the same day i ordered br br i have tried most of their coffees and have yet to be disappointed if you are looking for a good mid priced coffee i would recommend la minita tarrazu de costa rica br br i highly recommend you check out u roast em for all your coffee needs,great coffee great prices and great service
10551,i love these snacks great variety of flavors all mixed into one bag i also send them to our troops in afghanistan and iraq and they ship so much better than chips,one of my favorite snacks
10552,let me tell you right now if you love these dont order them in bulk i fell in love with them when i first tried them from the vending machine at work and for a small tiny packet at i was like forget this ill get mine from amazon and stock up which i did they arrived in excellent condition they were tasty crunchy not expired unlike some other food items from here i was completely satisfied with the shipping and handling and condition and taste of item br br now i am sick of gardetto cuz i had too much too soon but they definitely are very yummy my colleague love them too br br,yum
10553,makes for a great snack both at work and at home glad to be getting this shipped to my front door every two months,i am addicted to this stuff
10554,my son has missed peppermint patties for over a year these honey mints are fabulous and he loves them too br allergy free goodness,gluten dairy corn soy free bliss
10555,modeled after york peppermint patties these mints are a perfect match of chocolate and sweet the honey filling is a bit thinner and sweeter than most mints this style but you can tell all the ingredients are natural the thin layer of gooey honey complements the unsweetened chocolate beautifully i highly recommend this tasty treat,delicious complementary flavors
10556,i am well was a york pep patty addict but after reading the ingredients sugar semisweet chocolate chocolate sugar lactose cocoa cocoa butter milk fat soy lecithin and pgpr emulsifiers and vanillin artificial flavor corn syrup invert sugar egg whites and oil of peppermint i realized i did not want to eat corn syrup which i avoid and why is it now in there when years ago it wasn t i mean the first ingredient is sugar then there is pgpr i believe a preservative that also was never an ingredient years ago soy which is an allergen to many as well as eggs br br ok enough of that rant br br i have been trying to find a substitute and you can see a review of another honey mint i recently tried i was not totally thrilled br br so yesterday while at my health food store i bought one honey acre mint and gave it a try and wow so yummy the filling is creamy and the chocolate a velvet consistency and the mint well minty had i known i would have bought more than br br sooooo i just ordered a box of these and they will be my official peppermint patty addiction o,goodbye york hello honey acres
10557,i tried these because a friend had allergies i don t but i am hooked the honey goes down smoother than the sugar in regular mint patties these mints are yummy,awesome mints even for those without allergies
10558,i got these from a local bee keeping specialty store in sacramento they are so good i came online to see if i can get them for less highly recommended for fellow food allergy sufferers,yay gluten peanut and soy free yum
10559,be sure the weather is cooler than degrees when ordering i recieved mine right off of the ups truck after they had been riding around at least half of a day and i recieved bags of hard melted dark chocolate i tried to contact amazon but was unable to so ended up getting them from family fun shoppe br several days later i finally reached someone at amazon and they took the time to straighten things out and refunded my money the gentleman i talked to was very nice and the pieces were are very tasty br br the problem was in the packaging the second shipment had a small bag of dry ice in it,melted morsels
10560,i ordered bags of york pieces for wedding favors half of the bags were melted and amazon has a no return policy on food items i would not order food products from a online vendor again,melted
10561,if you like mint chocolate or york peppermint patties for that matter then there is no reason you will not like the taste of these they are just like eating m ms but with minty freshness added to them stars because i think these candies are overpriced for what they are,minty chocolatey pieces
10562,i absolutely love this tea it has a great mild taste to it the fact that is decafinated is a great plus i highly recommnend this tea,great tea
10563,just rec d these yesterday and not only was the shipping super speedy but the candy was extremely fresh will order from again without hesitation,amazing
10564,i found these in california and i remembered them when i was a kid they dontsell them in florida br where i live so i bought them on amazon and whenever my children visist me of i go west i load up on them br nothing better,the best dark chocolate covered marshmallow my deam bar
10565,this is my first experience with antioxidant rich white tea also i like the fair trade and organic labels since i prefer mild teas the subtle honey like sweetness and floral fruity notes of white rose tea are immediately pleasing a stronger brew intensifies the rose flavor but the tea remains smooth without bitter tannins often found in green and black teas the white tea and rose blend is exquisite a wonderful soothing treat by itself or with dessert br br this has become my favorite tea,everything is rose y
10566,br white rose velvet garden white tea is an exciting and unusual premium numi tea it is a white tea more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well having been only plucked and dried not oxidized some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience i know i do white rose velvet garden white tea is certified organic and is both fair trade and kosher br br it is made from hand wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds rosebuds can you imagine those are the only two ingredients and they are delicate and delicious different from anything else i have ever tried this amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely not in this tea it is made from only white tea and roses br br this tea like all numi teas is packaged with post consumer waste and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors and i love this and can tell the difference for this and many other reasons numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers br br on the box numi writes roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance numi enchanting velvet garden tm releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink with every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate spring white tea imparts a silken smoothness white tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy high in antioxidants and vitamin c this uplifting fair trade certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair i have to agree this is truly an amazing tea br br if you like numi teas get it you will not be sorry if you are new to numi but love white tea or are curious to try it from the description i do not think you could find a better source than numi if you are looking for a romantic tea white rose velvet garden white tea fits the bill perfectly br br highly recommended br,romantic natural unique tea experience
10567,if you want a mild cup of tea that still has a decent aroma and flavor this will do the trick wonderful for drinking with biscuits and other mild cookies or cake wonderful when you just want something that feels like you are pampering yourself good for a steambath facial too i steeped one bag five minutes by accident but it still was delicate,delicate but still satisfying
10568,i first tried this tea when it came in a numi sampler set that my daughter brought me for christmas i tried it and fell in love with it only problem is that no store in the area carried that tea so i ended up buying it online at amazon and the price was fair tea is amazing,amazing tea
10569,have generally enjoyed this product over a few years but found that one container of lb size that i was shipped so far had quite inferior ghee with the milk fat still present made me a bit sick and threw away rest of container,amul ghee
10570,so i bought this after watching an alton brown episode where he talks about ghee being clarified butter the best you can get and really deals with high heat i put it in fridge and i scooped out what i thought was about cup spoonful for my cooking last night wow cooks well no more smoke than cooking on any high heat setting and i had some left over i think maybe you should use less than you originally use of other oils as this does not evaporate the same really cool stuff and no additional taste of french fries or other stir fried items coolness,this stuff is great
10571,i initially bought this for my hair crazy i know after seeing it on a hair forum when it arrived i chickened out and used it for cooking i am from haiti and i use this on almost everything it has a slight nutty taste easy to use,great for cooking
10572,i had high hopes for this product just to be completely let down by the broken lids on both jars which let the ghee leak all over the shipping box it was shipped with broken lids from the seller because the pieces of broken lid were not in the box i will never buy anything from this seller again be warned the ghee was runny probably from sitting in storage at the seller business with air getting to the product through the broken lids,what a waste of money
10573,i bought fireworks wisconsin white birch popcorn oz seeking the perfect popcorn for my whirleypop popper but i wrecked the batches simply by cooking them too hot now i have discovered on my own how to do it right br br if you want perfect popcorn here is my secret br add ounces of oil in popper kernels br on electric stove yeah i know set burner between and on scale of to if you set it for you will have small lousy and even unpopped results who knew br when the kernels pop add cup of kernels any more than this and they will spill over br meanwhile melt to of one cube of butter in microwave for seconds br when popped turn the whirley handle to prevent popped corn from overheating or shake your pot the one on the stove if you lack this popper and pour into your favorite bowl don t put butter into your popcorn cooker drizzling butter and sprinkling a smidgen of salt br br the very best you have ever had true br br another tip i deliberately make extra putting the rest into a foodsaver airtight canister it stays genuinely fresh throughout the week br br p s i am just a happy customer i do not sell popcorn but now i eat too much of it,absolutely perfect just do not heat at too high a temperature
10574,absolutely loved this product loved the variety my granddaughter and i are sampling each one she likes the mini kernels,wisconsinmade gourmet variety pack
10575,and that is not a detraction i love lemon grass tea i love this soup going to double my order on the next one i make this one is so good it is the only one i have ever found that i made a second when i finished the first i am thinking stirfry some chicken breast add a handful of slivered veggies and make this one a real meal,not quite lime more lemon grassy
10576,the good news very easy to make tasty good noodles a few veggies br br the bad news mg of sodium about half your daily allowance yikes br br notes calories mg cholesterol g fiber g sugar g protein g fat g saturated fat br br these noodles are tasty the broth is ok there are a few veggies sprinkled on top pour in boiling water wait minutes or longer and you are done a good quick hot lunch when you are in a hurry but do not eat too often as the sodium content is incredibly high and would not be good for you ok once in awhile though unless you are on a sodium restricted diet in which case why are you even reading this far br br tip you can probably reduce the sodium content by pouring off the liquid after preparing and eating just the noodles and veggies or add your own healthier liquid broth even if you wish br br also you can let this sit for minutes of even longer and it will be good and still very hot,good noodles but incredibly high sodium content
10577,i love this flavor the do not sale is specific flavor in the stores here in missouri i love it,lauri
10578,the lime flavor is too much didnt think it would be so strong its ok but there are much better flavors to be had would not buy again,worst ramen ever
10579,taken is taken but after you have a lot of different kinds you tend to establish a taste favorite basically if the price is good go for it,good taste
10580,i would have liked to give these and a half stars because they are basically middle of the road they taste more or less like a fig newton and you will not miss the fat at all they are not as soft as fig newtons br br these cookies are great if you are on a diet because two of them are only calories however they are on the small side so you may end up eating more br br i would say that overall the taste is comparable to a fig newton but slightly more firm in texture and a smaller size with all things considered if a box of fig newtons and fig newmans were sitting on the shelf together i would probably just go by price and get the cheaper item and not think about the brand,okay
10581,i stumbled onto these and decided to give them a try i am so glad i did they are delicious you would never know they are fat free the calories are lower than in other brands and the taste is far superior try them,delicious
10582,they taste slightly different from what i remember of fig newtons obviously distinct i was a little surprised at first it seemed maybe a little more clay like and then they grew on me they are addicting,addicting
10583,these are a healthy altrnative to cookies they taste great and area a pretty good value i recommend to anyone looking for a healthier cookie but still has the taste you are looking for in a dessert treat,delicious cookies
10584,we have used this food for over years and my dog loves it it is healthy and keeps her coat shiny and her belly full,my dog loves this food
10585,i buy this coffee from a japanese grocery store though i would happily buy it from amazon if the price were similar i prepare it by heating a mug of equal quantities of milk and water in the microwave then adding a tablespoon of this coffee and some sugar i imagine like all instant coffee it would taste pretty nasty without the milk but with milk it actually is good this is the fastest way to obtain a cup of tolerable coffee that i know of short of buying it already made,good with lots of milk
10586,it is all it is cracked up to be i will be ordering more when i run out the product came in the mail on time and in good condition,ginger extract
10587,i had been looking for an affordable priced quinoa since it is pretty expensive in my store i noticed amamzon com had a sale on quinoa and took a chance on buying it since we had never tried it before the now brand of quinoa is organic which is a huge plus the grains are pretty clean already but i still rinse before using the qunioa is great so very healthy and cooks in around minutes even though the pacakge states minutes i will be definitly be buying this brand again from amazon com as it arrived in excellent condition within days br br if you are thinking about trying buying quinoa i highly recommend the now organic quinoa,now foods organic quinoa is great
10588,i love quinoa for its delicious taste texture and nutritional benefits this now brand as sold on amazon is a great bargain i do a lot of research before i purchase items and feel satisfied that this is a good deal there is no need to soak this quinoa the bag tells you to rinse it before using but i never have and we love the taste quinoa can be used in a variety of ways but one of our favorites is to make quinoa pilaf the same way you would make rice pilaf simply chop onions carrots and celery and saute in olive oil then add the quinoa and substitute chicken broth for the water and cook as per directions quinoa is a great substitute for rice in general this brand provides consistent results always cooking evenly br br tip when i open a bag and use a bit i store the rest in a glass mason jar to keep it fresh that way it is easy to scoop out what you need and stores beautifully in the pantry cabinet,very happy
10589,i consider myself a fanatical quinoa connoisseur having enjoyed many varieties over several decades now foods organic quinoa is by far the best quinoa i have ever purchased first the quinoa seeds themselves are thoroughly pre rinsed there is no acrid flavor whatsoever there is no impurity in this product it is quinoa i do not know what now has done differently but this quinoa cooks more evenly than any other quinoa i mean the seeds all cook about the same not mushy not too sticky it is about cents per lb more than the cheapest quinoa but remember that it is organic while the other quinoa is not i highly recommend this quinoa,very clean organic cooks evenly
10590,this grain is an excellent substitute for rice it only takes two cans of chicken broth to one package of quinoa to make a lot of very tasty and filling finished product which can be used with gravy sauce mixed vegetables or anything you like,tasty
10591,this quinoa has to be rinsed i would not have ordered it if i had known that there are many other brands for the same price that dont require this annoying and messy step,directions say to rinse
10592,our local coffee shop uses this mix and it is great i have been thinking about buying some for home but i was wondering if someone could post the nutritional information for me br br thanks,some of the best mix for frappes
10593,i absolutely love this delicious drink i usually have it iced and top it with whipped cream so refreshing and such a treat br br its so easy to make and tastes like a choclatey mocha thick shake we all love it and recommend this highly have also used their smoothie mix also excellent,the best
10594,i ordered soozies doozies soft rich cookie gift tin for my daughter for easter br she loved them because they were fresh and made with all natural ingridients br i would purchase them again,delicious all natural cookies
10595,i love amy because you can actually pronounce all the ingredients she uses no chemicals no preservatives nothing you need a chemistry degree to decipher and she makes pretty tasty food normally i am not a big fan of canned soups but the alphabet soup is an exception it is a rich tomatoey broth with a few vegetables and pasta alphabets i like soup without a lot of clutter so to speak my sole complaint is that the alphabet noodles are a bit mushy but then what do you expect in a canned soup still if you are looking for something to warm you on a chilly or rainy day amy fat free alphabet soup fits the bill,a hearty delicious soup
10596,as i am writing this review i am sitting here at my computer wolfing down the food because i am starving br br i heated product in a saucepan over high heat for minutes until boiling base tastes like regular tomato soup better than campbell tomato soup i would say there are vegetables mixed in corn green beans and carrots green beans and carrots basically turn to mush in my mouth and i can barely taste them corn is not mushy but does not taste sweet i suspect this has something to do with being canned in a tomato base alphabet noodles have a nice texture smooth and not too mushy br br i love this soup very satisfying for something that is fat free will re purchase many times i am sure this would also make excellent kids food,delicious
10597,i will start off by saying i have yet to purchase this on amazon but i have purchased this at health food stores so i can not say how it will arrive to you but i cant tell you about the taste br amy organic has consistently done a great job of creating delicious vegan vegetarian organic food this soup has a very similar taste to certain canned pasta product it totally brought me back to my childhood it is extremely delicious low in fat and calories it is a quick and healthy alternative to the old stand bys we are used to whether to give your child a better lunch or a trip down memory lane for yourself please give this soup a chance,alphabet soup deliciousness
10598,i am pregnant and lately have been craving foods from my childhood like peanut butter sandwiches barbecue chips apple juice i have been in a soup mood lately and bought a bunch of amy soups at whole foods this soup is light and delicious and tastes like spaghetti o of course it is more soup like and healthier but that is what this reminded me of,brings back memories
10599,my kids love this soup and i love having a few on hand it is a reliable meal with some toast and cheese i often add tofu to it to bump up the protein and they never notice,easy kid treat
10600,this is my year old son absolute favorite soup that he takes to school almost every day despite my attempts to broaden his taste buds he continues to insist that he wants this red soup every day with crackers my husband and i have also tried it and it is quite delicious like all amy products you can feel good about giving your child this soup the ingredients are all organic and tasty i have offered my son campbell soups in a pinch when i have run out of the amy alphabet soup but he really does not care for them if you read the label on campbell soup you will realize that they are loaded with junk br br amy soups cost a bit more than traditional canned soup but i think the extra cost is justified in higher quality ingredients and delicious taste,a delicious tomato based soup
10601,although i loved the ease and price of making this purchase online when it arrived over half of the cans were very severely dented a few so much so that it was almost impossible to order them br br i definitely have to reconsider where i purchase this in the future,amy alphabet soup
10602,i like this coffee but for two ounce bags i can get it online from walmart or even from my local grocery store for per ounce bag geez,what is with the price
10603,my papillon has been eating this for a while and loves it it was easy switching from his previous dog food purina of some sort and he took to it right away,loves it
10604,i am a fan of virginia peanuts and virginia diner does some of the best these are peanuts that have not been fancied up not very salty no artificial flavors and no oily feel to them you get that wonderful pure peanut taste another plus they are big,real peanuts
10605,i absolutely love kashi granola bars especially these honey almond fax and the trail mix variety but i will not be buying them from this seller as you can see on the box shown these are actually in a six pack not a pack as the description states so that comes out to bars for whoa a box i do not think so so while i would definitely recommend these bars as seriously good food that is good for you fyi read the ingredients list all pronounceable and healthy i would not recommend buying them from this seller many of the club stores get them at least occasionally and you can get a good deal,item good description and price not so good
10606,for some unknown reason the price for this item jumped from to within just two months perhaps the outrageous jump in price was due to the demand of billion chinese keep it seller,from to
10607,the bar tastes good if you are looking for something that is not too sweet and on that note you should know that you can probably find a better tasting granola bar but it probably will not be as healthy for you as this one is br br it a good bar that is not too sweet and if you can buy them for less than cents per bar then i would say you made a good purchase,a good healthy bar that is not very sweet
10608,i have to admit that these kashi bars are fed to my sheep as treats and they love them i on occasion have one and enjoy them as well,honey almond flax granola kashi bars
10609,the granola bars are pretty decent they bars are lightly honeyed so it is not too sweet but still sweet enough the bar is well textured and contains bits of nuts with the flax bars of it might be a bit much but it is definitely manageable as it lasts a decent amount of time,overwhelming number but decent granola bars
10610,gimme better ingredients kind larabars for more or sweeter items genuine junk for less not sure i would invest in a single bar again let alone this size,slightly healthier but not worth it
10611,i am used to overly sweet granola bars so when i first had these it seemed like they needed some sugar but by the time i got through the first box i adjusted to the lower sugar content and found myself thoroughly addicted they have a lovely chewy texture with plenty of huge chunks of almond for added crunch these are good i would love to buy them in bulk and have them shipped automatically but i would not pay more than the three dollars or so a box of six that wal mart or target charges so a box of should really be about even at grocery store prices we would be talking about we ll see how they are priced when they come in,yummy addictive bar can i afford it
10612,if you have recently been on a lower carb eating plan such as the new york body plan a href http www amazon com gp product b fl fd the ultimate new york body plan just weeks to a total transformation a and found you really feel better eating less starches than you had in the past finding healthier carb choices to add back to your diet can be a challenge i really am grateful kashi makes this bar it has g of carb g pro g fiber g fat mostly from nuts and seeds it is fairly balanced has no artificial ingredients or sugar alcohols and really hits the spot i have tried all the kashi varieties and this remains my favorite my mother agrees if you are looking for a sweeter treat this is not the kashi for you however my brother thinks they taste like cardboard in any rate the amazon price is still higher than the grocery store price i am hoping it will drop soon,medium carb alternative
10613,this is for the price of like at the grocery store if only this were eligible for subscribe and save then it would be perfect i would not be surprised if the price were to double soon but i must say these are really good and at a good price,awesome
10614,i found the tarallini to be crumbly and have an unpleasant stale taste my previous experience with tarallini was different they were crunchier and not crumbly whether this is a specific mediterranean recipe i do not know but i would not buy this product again,la piana tarallini
10615,i was not a soba fan before but when i tried this i became a fan just cook for minutes and drain served either cold or hot good with just simplest soba soy sauce,like this soba
10616,i bought these based on another review from the other product the nutiva hempseeds pack stating that those hempseeds have crunchy husks in it and these do not i also based my purchase on all the great reviews on this product here i was expecting just the white hearts of the hempseeds sort of like when you buy shelled sunflower seeds when i opened the package i was severely disappointed it was white with black bits all over the place i will upload a picture when i get the chance it looked like dirt i gave it a taste and it felt like small bits of glass crunching in my mouth it was absolutely repugnant maybe i received a bad batch who knows i am not here to put off other potential buyers just telling my story on my purchase i am going to try another product because i really want to add hempseeds to my diet,there are still shells husks in the bag
10617,nutiva organic hemp seeds are so good for you they are protein omega and gla i think the msrp on these bags is each so amazon has these priced at almost half price this is a great affordable way to get some healthy proteins and fats br br amazon sent me very fresh product i subscribed n saved on july nd and it arrived via ontrac on july th the nutiva hempseed package says it was packed on may and is best before may pretty fresh product and tastes fresh too br br sprinkle on top of your cereal omelets yogurt soups salads and veggies br br hemp seeds require no advance soaking to derive optimal nutritional benefit br br here is a great way to enjoy hemp br cup hemp seeds br cup spring water br tbsp maple syrup honey stevia or your favorite sweetneer br dash himalyan salt br optional flavoriing cinnamon nutmeg vanilla cardamom br br combine all in a blender and blend well until a creamy white milk forms pour through a strainer to remove any husk residue will keep in refrigerator for days but i recommend preparing small batches right when you want to drink them as fresh is the most tasty and most nutritious you could also make a great milk out of a href http www amazon com gp product b qp t cinnamon red maca almond butter a,way to go amazon with this amazing price
10618,these are yummy i eat them right out of the bag i throw them into baked goods cereals etc i mix them into my kid pb sandwiches too to add an even extra boost of nutrition to their lunch my children need extra calories nutrition i have not found there to be too many hulls either i will order these again,love these
10619,i read a lot of the mixed reviews here and i ordered the product i actually tried a small bag at the local co op i absolutely love them they are very tasty and have a not too sweet nutty flavor yes there are some color variations in the bag but it does not change the texture or flavor i eat them in salads smoothies with oatmeal made chocolate candy with them and eat them straight out of the bag i have not found a negative thing about them you should try them you might like them as much as i do and they are organic which is important to me,i really like nutiva hemp seeds
10620,these were the first hemp seeds i have ever ordered i got them to add to my kale shakes so far i have been through four bags and not found one shell the taste is like that of an unsalted sunflower seed these include all essential amino acids and are one of many super foods i have added to my afternoon shake amazing product,great product no shells husks
10621,i was looking for an additional source of protien these are easy to incorporate into other foods and even shakes great for vegans they taste great on top of salads or yogurt br a good source of omegas too,hemp seeds
10622,these tasted fresh and nutty and i am happy with them i eat a few tablespoons daily right from the bag which i keep in the fridge after i open it great product,makes my tummy happy
10623,my son and i are allergic to sesame so these nutritious little seeds are a good alternative they are great to add to homemade crackers or even to pasta dishes everyone in the family likes them the reason for stars is that there are some black hulls mixed in that are pretty hard and get stuck in our teeth,good alternative to sesame seeds
10624,i love this product and order it frequently usually it arrives in a timely manner and in good condition when i opened this last shipment i found some hemp seed scattered throughout the box i carefully removed the first of two pouches and found a rip in the middle of the front of the bag most of the product was still in the pouch and appeared fresh and undamaged so i transferred it to a container the other pouch was intact i hope this is a one time occurrence and i will be ordering this again when i need more more care needs to be taken to assure that the pouches are handled properly and that they are all in good condition when packed,pouch was ripped
10625,these are nutty delicious and well packaged i put a couple tbls in a fruit shake every morning and i get to enjoy the flavor clean energy and satisfaction of hunger with them thanks hemp,everyday food
10626,these are so healthy and tasty just to eat by themselves even kind of tastes like a nut we even mix a few hemp seeds in with our baby about a year old about a teaspoon not too much meals every once in a while and he enjoys it if you like eating healthy this is a great deal thanks shalom lt,great
10627,it is sad that most food based hemp products come from outside the usa but this is not a political review but rather a quality review of a very enjoyable product since i eat a very strict paleo eating regimen seeds and nuts are a large part of my daily routine when i bake chicken or make a big salad i always sprinkle on hemp seeds the taste is not overpowering and it seems that nutiva quality is by far the best and most consistent another great selling point is that it is available through prime i am not going to get on a soap box about the health benefits of hemp go look it up and do your own research i enjoy this food and have for many years,yummy
10628,these are the tastey way to get hemp proetein into your diet my family i put them in salads cookies breads i ordered the pack of to be sent every three months seems just about right for my family of,love these seeds
10629,just as i have expected the order arrived shortly after i placed the order and the product is fresh i higly recommend this product,excellent value
10630,i was very satisfied with my purchase of nutiva hemp seeds i ordered a pack of them and it arrived fairly quickly they taste great on their own but i usually add them to protein shakes to enhance the amino acid profile or sprinkle them on top of salads for added flavor and texture my supply is almost gone so i will definitely be ordering more br br one of the reviews said there were still shells in the bag but i did not find any in mine,healthy and delicious
10631,i used the hemp seeds every morning with my protein shake the taste is great and they are so healthy,great flavor and so healthy
10632,nutiva is a company based out of sebastopol california their hemp seed is excellent for stir fries salads and their ounce pouches last awhile i have used their hemp seed as a substitute for sesame seed in stir fries in a href http www amazon com gp product simply in season expanded edition world community cookbook a as well as in the mayan wonder bars and rasta pasta primavera in a href http www amazon com gp product vegan fusion world cuisine extraordinary recipes timeless wisdom from the celebrated blossoming lotus restaurants a it is versatile and has a subtle nutty flavor they add extra protein nutritious and delicious,going nuts
10633,this is a great product the label said it was packaged at the end on january so it was very fresh these are really good out of the bag but i prefer to toast them by just putting some in a pan medium pan for a couple of minutes i have been adding different things to my low carb diet and this is one of my favorites because of the low carbs about net carbs per tablespoons,yummy
10634,these are great tasting candies for a sugar free variety but they get sticky and very hard to take out of the individual wrappers especially without getting the candy all over your fingers,great taste but hard to open
10635,i cannot sleep past am anymore because of this food one of my cats sits on my face attempting to suffocate me into consciousness cats are not very good at biology while the other kneads every bare spot of flesh he can find with his claws of love until i get up if i stop in the bathroom between stumbling out of bed and into the kitchen i am treated to a rousing refrain of mrow mrow scratch yowl outside of the door and that is if they do not follow me into the bathroom and circle around my legs like they are caught in my gravitational pull all the while insisting can opening is a far better use of my thumbs than anything else br br the only cons really and they are cute cons so i let it slide br br suffice it to say my cats love this stuff they eat it rocket around the house for minutes like they have just done some meth oh the power of organic ingredients then collapse in the sunspot on my vacated bed and sleep until i get home from work br br cat win i think so,meow mix has nothing on this shiz
10636,i have a pretty finicky feline i was a little nervous about trying something new but it was recommended to me it has been a huge hit i do not feed canned food daily and now she really wants it daily she absolutely loves it it is a great price and a great food,happy cat
10637,oddly i have given the cats turkey spinach in the oz size and they seemed to like it i bought cases of this oz and they only touch it after realizing that i will not give them more food br br it may be because i gave them turkey seafood for a while in between it is odd because they scarf up that flavor and they would scarf up the turkey spinach in the oz size weird br br i rate it stars for the ingredients and quality i always feed them castor pollux however as always test not only the flavor but also the size of the can when i scoop the food out of the can the consistency in the oz cans seems somewhat thicker than the oz in all flavors i have tried this may be a contributing factor to their distaste for this particular combination br br great product just verify kitty flavor approval,cat did not like flavor
10638,my sphynx cat loves the food but he has an allergic reaction to it it makes him cough choke intermittently over the course of a few days he has this same reaction when he drinks milk so i will find some other cat to share the product with,my sphynx cat reacts to it
10639,i generally consider keebler products to be definitely designed for children and not appealing to adult sensibilities i bought these on chance because i love mint flavored products and they were on sale i fully expected to find them gagging and that i would have to give them away br br surprisingly they are not bad i would not buy them again since there are so many similar products which are better but they have good points each bar is large not as big as a candy bar but close each bar is individually wrapped which i thought was overkill for a box of cookies but that makes it easy to throw one into a lunch box or purse note that you only get six cookies in the whole box the cookies are surprisingly light and crispy definitely sweet but not overly so unlike many other keebler products the mint flavor is fresh and not wimpy and the chocolate flavor is mild but still pleasant the flavors overall are well balanced with emphasis on the mint as it should be br br i m not sure if these are designed for children or adults they seem much too large to be meant for children and i am not sure if kids would enjoy this combination of flavors in this configuration,surprisingly good if still keebler level
10640,delicious so glad i found these cookies softer than your average gluten free cookie with no after taste they can be addicting,one of my favorite gluten free cookies
10641,blue diamond almonds whole natural ounce packages pack of i buy these nuts every time amazon has them they are very good for you and much less expensive then the grocery store when you figure per bag price i pay here i have a heart condition and need all the good protein i can get these are a good source for this it is only natural fat and no added salt i wish i could get them even at a bigger savings with the savings by subscribe and save br br my husband carries these in his pocket as a mid day snack and i have my daily dose that my md orders they taste very good once you get used to eating no salt or added oils br br i highly recommend i hope this helps,almonds
10642,i first bought the small calorie pack box in my local store they are a wonderful source of protein without the carbs salt and extra sugar that come with other snacks or with roasted nuts e g especially honey roasted nuts br br these whole raw almonds are great for anyone with a blood sugar issue the raw almonds will not make your blood sugar spike are handy if your blood sugar has dropped and you need a quick source of food and the ounce bags are sturdy and will not rip or have not yet in my overly packed and oft mangled bag br br as the previous reviewer mentioned once you start eating these you will not miss the added fat and salt of any distributor roasted nuts since eating these natural almonds i have not missed the traditional roasted nut taste i grew up on the usual nuts but now i find i really look forward to this new clean taste for all these reasons i recommend blue diamond raw almonds br br however if you still think that these almonds are not crunchy enough for you especially if you bought the canned nuts you could always roast them yourself put the raw almonds on a cookie sheet you may want to line your sheet with foil or parchment paper in a pre heated oven at degree f stir them a few times to ensure they do not scorch i would check around minutes especially if your oven is a bit temperamental like mine and stir and check again before minutes because it is amazing how fast nuts can go from almost done to scorched or worse burnt roasting them yourself still has to be much healthier than any nuts that are cooked in oil remember also if you do roast the raw almonds in the oven please cool them completely and then refrigerate them afterward,excellent source of protein especially when you are away from home
10643,i am completely satisfied with this purchase of individual packs of almond nuts have ate about bags by now and everyone is delicious with no bad nuts cannot think of anything bad with the whole deal the bag sizes are perfect for an in between meal snack and are are really healthy for you,perfect to go snacks
10644,when i was told by my nutritionist that eating a handful of whole natural almonds a day would help me to lose weight and get the right kind of fats and proteins implemented into my diet i was a bit skeptical i was not a huge almond fan to begin with i do not particularly enjoy salted or roasted almonds usually only the kind that come surrounded with coconut and chocolate or the kind that you get out of the nut bowl to shell around the holidays the whole natural almonds by blue diamond taste like they came right out of the shell and boy are they yummy br br i like that they are a satisfying snack and i like the taste of them these are the ones i buy no added salt or anything nice and fresh right out of the shell br br stars,tasty and healthy good for dieting
10645,i am addicted to nuts i know it sounds funny but i am and these are no exception but i thought i would let everybody know that they are unsalted which doesn br t bother me one bit but my children prefer the smokehouse ones that have salt on them i will buy again,they are unsalted
10646,we bought this based on what amazon mentioned in its product description which says calorie pack but this is not cal pack they are infact calorie pack nothing wrong with the item as such and not that i am going to return it but i would prefer a cal pack over a cal pack amazon please correct the prod description,good product but wrong description
10647,for those who remember cracking almond shells this tastes the same love that there is no salt added and perfect protein natural snack between meals or as a meal for people like me who always forget to eat i have got them strategically placed to make sure something gets in during the day when i am studying or writing if you prefer blue diamond dry roasted excessively salted almonds you probably will not like these i like both just do not use salt except in baking,raw unsalted almonds
10648,whom ever came up with the idea to dip pretzels in yogurt was either high a genious or the devil himself probably all br br point is these things are so freaking good the right amount of salt and sweet on each pretzel it is hard to stop eating them so a word of caution for every pretzels you eat you get gm of sugar and so people trying to lose weight or in any sort of special diet should pay extra attention when or before eating these br br there absolutely nothing negative to say about this product the bags of them came well packaged and the pretzels taste fresh i cannot really give this product a low score due to its sugar content etc because i knew what i was buying and expected it to be this way hope this helps,so freaking good
10649,these are great ridiculously addicting br br good sense makes some of the best yogurt pretzels around the ounce bags are perfect i keep a bag at work and with the built in seal they always taste fresh,addicting
10650,these are good but a bit skimpy on the candy coating the ones i get at my supermarket have a thicker layer of yogurt coating but the store does not carry them that often so i keep these on hand just in case the urge strikes and my local store is out i love the combination of crispy salty pretzel with creamy yogurt flavored candy coating,good flavor
10651,they are soooo good i am so addicted to these pretzels i am having to control myself from eating more than a bag a day i hope amazon continues to have them and does not quit carrying them order them now you will not regret it but your waist line might,delicious
10652,all i can say is that our two dogs love these things almost more than anything else they each get one a day and very much look forward to that special time these long lasting treats are well worth the money for us,canine testimonial
10653,my basenji lily loves rawhide munchy sticks beef pack and chicken pack best but these are a great deal and she will chew happily on these as well i guess she is not too picky,great bargain treat
10654,i bought this product to get rid of black ants in my house it did not help at all i even tried mixing it with sugar and placing it where the ants used to go well they just do not go anywhere close to it it really looks like it repels the ants instead of attracting them i have not found yet a product that work for my ants except the spray that kills them instantly but i cannot spray it in the kitchen and i have ants all around the counter top even if it is cleaned to perfection,black ants do not even get close to it
10655,for years i used a href http www amazon com gp product b hjbkmq senoret chemical terro liquid ant baits bx a it worked extremely well within hours all ants were gone however my latest infestation was not responding to terro in fact they were eating the liquid up but it was not killing the ants my neighborhood hardware supply store told me that insects could become tolerant to certain pesticides i found the safer product but was skeptical take off the spout cover and blast a fine white powder into the cracks or places where the ants are coming through for me it was under two long baseboards in the kitchen then i swept up the excess white powder into the cracks some more and cleaned the tile of any powder it worked instantly any ants that even touched the powder immediately started to wiggle and die i have a cat so i cleaned any excess up carefully so she cannot get any on her paws as it is very toxic it is as good as boric acid br br this powder claims to kills ants cockroaches earwigs silverfish crickets millipedes and centipedes i did notice that immediately after applying this product silverfish started to appear evidently sensing the chemicals soon they will be gone do check it out i am so glad to be rid of those ants they even got into my freezer where i had chocolate,finally the ants are gone
10656,i love this gravy mix much easier and less fat than making from scratch and not as salty as mccormick or other brands br br i use non fat milk instead of water to make a cream gravy this is good stuff and by time you order this set of and other items there is no shipping and no tax the price is much less than i could get when on sale at my local supermarket,knorr soups and mixes are the best and so is amazon price
10657,the grape jam itself is of the highest quality and it tastes great so i have absolutely no complaints there however the glass jars were poorly packaged it was very heavy and fragile and was insulated with just two small pillow puffs and two of the twelve jars arrived with the seals already broken since i could not be sure if the food was safe to eat i had to throw away the two jars i would not order this product again or anything else that comes in jars for that reason,a little disappointed
10658,this tin must have been sitting on the shelf for a decade it was totally dried out when i opened it when treacle sponge pudding dries it smells nasty and cannot be reconstituted even with water and some heat br br total waste of money,awful how can they sell this in good conscience
10659,these are hands down my favorite potato chips they are very light and flaky with a hint of vinegar that make them simply irresistible,my favorite chip
10660,i like this product because it is a very fast working product it works every time and you know what to expect no unexpected emergencies very smooth,organic smooth move
10661,several people recommended this tea to me when i was on a high protein diet and things got stopped up i do not love the taste sort of licorice but after adding a sweetener i liked it better it is effective sip it in the evening,smooth move really helps move
10662,ok folks listen up for special occasions we will spend the big bucks and get a rack of lamb you are lucky today if you can even find it in the stores it is so expensive often at per pound so the very last thing you want to do after spending all that money is ruin it with the wrong flavoring colorado spices new zealand lamb rub has the right blend of herbs that goes well on just about any meat we just used it on some fresh bluefin and yellowfin tuna and it was fantastic my year old mother who cooks every day and is not a huge spice fan she used to plain new england cooking loves and uses the rub on chicken lamb and fish she is having me order another case and loves the individual packets as the rub does not lose its taste or flavor and stays fresh this is a great product,fantastic rub nothing better in the market
10663,is this hot chocolate yes br is this good hot chocolate um sorta br is this gourmet hot chocolate not a chance br br in my opinion the only advantage you get but using the green mountain k cups of hot chocolate is the simplicity of using your keurig machine to heat the water instead of using the microwave or stove top other than that the finished product is comparable to any swiss miss or other brand of powdered instant cocoa it actually may be worse if you use the largest setting on your machine the largest setting makes it much too watery br br green mountain needs to go back to the drawing board on this br br stars because it does make hot chocolate in your keurig without having to dirty dishes and tear open pouches but if you are looking for good hot chocolate keep shopping,average
10664,it is indeed a rich and creamy chocolaty delight if you use the smallest cup size on your machine remember to shake the box well before using some cocoa still remains in the k cup after brewing but regardless you get a very satisfying cup of hot cocoa,became an instant favorite
10665,i have never had any hot chocolate that tastes better than this not homemade not from starbucks not from swissmiss this is hands down the best i have ever had i go through so much of this stuff because whenever friends come over they go straight for it br br but what happened to the price most k cups run from about but amazon has these things going for even bed bath beyond has them cheaper than that bring the price back down to something reasonable and your star review will return,best hot chocolate i have ever tasted worst price i have ever seen
10666,this is a fantastic soy based product that is not too sweet is very smoothe and wonderfully chocolaty br i highly recommend this,great tasting product
10667,for the price you pay and size of each cup you can really only make the smallest size you are getting taken with this purchase buy the traditional mix from any other company you will get a better value better taste and a richer texture this snot a horrible mix it tastes ok but it is nothing more than a decent cup of chocolate flavored water it has no thickness to it swiss miss or any other grocery store hot chocolate beats it hands down br all you are getting with this is convenience of using k cups which is not much of one to begin with br avoid it,a small cup of chocolate flavored water
10668,it is so watery and weak i had to brew the smallest cup and then put in another pod to get a full cup of hot chocolate this makes the pods very expensive and not figure friendly each pod is calories so a full cup would be will not purchase anymore,keurig hot chocolate pods
10669,very tasty you do need to remove the top and scrape out the remaining cocoa to really get all of the flavor this is what we have had to do with every brand of cocoa we have bought the flavor is excellent,good cocoa
10670,my wife loves this item she will not drink any other hot chocolate the k cup system is great,best hot chocolate ever
10671,the hot chocolate has a weird flavor to it i will not be buying this product again and will probably not consider any more green mountain products,green mtn hot choc
10672,i recently bought a keurig coffee maker and was looking for k cups when i discovered this my daughter is a hot chocolate lover and so i decided to give this a try if your coffee machine has different size drink settings use smallest size setting otherwise it is too watery but when done on the lowest size setting it makes a very good cup of hot cocoa my daughter loves it and has it nearly every morning it is very convenient and if you have a keurig coffee maker and are looking for drink alternatives to coffee this is a good choice,good for a different drink option
10673,very rich chocolate taste not too sweet great for a cold winter evening topped with mini marshmellows i will certainly reccomend it,green mountain hot cocoa
10674,i originally tried this as a part of a variety pack i am glad i did not buy the whole package if you like richer hot chocolates then you will not like this i tried making this hot chocolate on all three settings smaller medium larger cups on the three option keurig machines all of the options tasted too watery for me i would often add creamer to try to substitute for the lack of flavor to them if this is a machine you have in your office and are looking for something different than coffee it is like the stars rating claims okay it tastes like what it is a mediocre hot chocolate they added to a coffee line to simply offer variety br br personally i prefer to just use swiss miss packets and use the keurig to heat the water you get better taste by a company known for hot chocolate and the convenience of the keurig machine plus you save a lot of money,it is ok describes this perfectly
10675,i used the minimum cup size to try and maximize the chocolate taste this did not help but if you like a weak chocolate taste then you will like it,not very good hot chocolate
10676,i do not like this product at all much tastier and cheaper to just use hot water and a packet of hot chocolate mix from nestle or swiss miss,terrible hot chocolate
10677,this product would be better made with milk which of course then would not be for the keurig machine there are other brands i prefer,did not like it
10678,this hot chocolate is pretty blah not very chocolatey and certainly not very strong it is not the fault of the keurig the cafe escapes dark chocolate is way better,weak hot chocolate
10679,yuck worst chocolate i have ever had save your money on this brand and find another does not even taste taste like chocolate we threw the rest away,horrible chocolate
10680,i have been through two cup boxes of this hot chocolate and it is not great it is not badly priced and the first few sips are fine but after it sits for five minutes cooling in your cup it separates it ends up being watery for the most part with a bunch of chocolate mix on the bottom,not hot
10681,of course the keurig green mtn hot cocoa is the ultimate in convenience but frankly the flavor is not so hot best description is slightly chocolate flavored cardboard everything else about it is fine consistency ease of use but g m should ramp up the flavor with way more chocolate,not so hot cocoa
10682,i recommend this instead for the same price a href http www amazon com gp product b hd peq swiss miss hot cocoa mix milk chocolate count envelopes pack of a br br this thing falls short i found myself adding some milk or my non dairy creamers to my cup of this to make it taste somewhat creamy it more or less tastes horrible otherwise after i hated it i decided to make it with a cup of hot milk i just decided to pour it into a hot cup of milk and it tastes so much better in my opinion they need to up the powdered milk in them or the non dairy creamer in them it would improve this product so greatly br br they are thieves nonetheless you usually get envelopes of hot cocoa that tastes better than this in the supermarket for less than five bucks buy two for less than ten and still be spending less than what i spent with these i really thought i was buying quality this is definitely not unless i use milk which is like cheating myself and spending extra money i have drank common hot cocoa from supermarket straight with water that tasted way better than this br br avoid,it is ok but certainly not worth the cost
10683,the hot chocolate is fine but the price here is crazy you can get the same thing on the keurig site for under,cost too much
10684,definitely use the smallest amount of water and be sure to shake the cup before brewing the kids got a kick out of making their own kid coffee but this was only after we tweaked it with less water and brewed it with marshmallows on top the hot cocoa hitting the marshmallows releases added sugar as well as turns the marshmallows nice and mushy br br the rest of us do not care to waste our daily calories on something that was in our opinion chocolatey water still it was worth the price for the simple fact that the kiddos can come in from sledding and brew their own hot cocoa without much mess,kids will be satisfied adults will not want to waste their calories
10685,i enjoy a good cup of hot chocolate on a cold day this is okay you cannot expect much when when all you use is water i would say it is a bit better than the instant hot chocolate packets but not by much what i like the best is the easy factor i can let my yo make her own cup without worrying about pulling hot water out of the micro and spilling it all over while trying to mix it like you do in the packets so for that alone its a great deal price is not the best but again the convienience is key,my yo loves them
10686,of all the cups i have used this has the most rich flavorful on the large setting for my size machine absolutely no chocolate left in cup came out clean looking and no mess left in the machine my machine directions recommended doing a hot water cycle through after brewing chocolate but no need with this one yummmm,most rich cup yet on keurig
10687,i like my hot chocolate to have alot of chocolatey flavor even when i use the smallest size brewing cup the green mountain hot cocoa k cups tastes watered down i have to add my own powdered hot chocolate to give it enough flavor,not as good as i would hoped
10688,i had high hopes for the convenience of this product my daughter loves hot chocolate this really was a total disappointment i threw these kcups out if you use the smallest setting on your keurig you get oz of watery hot chocolate larger settings are not drinkable br br save your money and get cocoa packets or a good tin of hot cocoa and take advantage of the instant hot water the keurig provides,really bad hot chocolate
10689,i was expecting a bit better after reading other reviews this is about the same as any other hot chocolate made with water i prefer making it with milk as the flavor and texture is much better adding milk did not help much i guess mom spoiled me good,not great
10690,my year old loves to make a cup of this before school every morning the cocoa tastes wonderful and brews up nice we add a splash of milk to cool it off and it is so good i do not taste anything artificial in fact the quality is great we will bring this camping for the younger kids with the powders we always had clumps this brews a great cup every time and tastes like the expensive coffee shop stuff,tastes great
10691,the hot chocolate was very tasty but pretty expensive for hot chocolate you can buy hot chocolate k cups in most retail stores and some grocery chains and it is the same thing for less money than advertised on here,hot chocolate k cups
10692,i recently bought a keurig coffee maker because my husband and i love our coffee and tea but sometimes want different drinks on certain days and this coffee maker fit the bill we both enjoy this hot cocoa as much as do our grandchildren likely the best hot cocoa k cup that we have tried so far they arrived sooner than expected and arrived as described happy with the service and the product br comment comment permalink,great product
10693,one of the best tasting cocoa mix i have found so easy to make just one cup for myself and the cup is br easy to clean with no grounds invovlved use with k cup lids,cocoa cups
10694,this is a great product to put in your keurig machine i use is with a cup of coffee and make a mocha,hot chochlate for the coffe machin
10695,such good hot chocolate for the k cup brewers out there do not pass this one up is not too sweet and very chocolatey,delicioso
10696,this product wad very weak i could not even make out that it was supposed to be hot chocolate will never buy again a waste of money,okay hot chocolate
10697,these are very good tasting and very fast making drinks the convene e of having a cup of hot chocolate in seconds and have it taste good is such a plus,excellent product
10698,the local auto shop offers this free to it customers i have tried it twice and liked it both times perhaps if i had to pay for it i might not love the price but i would still enjoy the flavor,quick easy and tasty
10699,this product was not very good at all it did not have the taste or consistency of the wanted beverage,hot cocoa
10700,i thought that getting hot cocoa would be a nice change but after having my machine get clogged up needing to clean the needles and then putting a rinse brew after each cup is made i have found it faster to stick with the packet of instant mix and heat water in the microwave,expensive
10701,this cocoa is very good i love it so does my son i actually like to mix half coffee with this cocoa very tasty and my son likes the flavor and the fact that it is low in carbs,wilco
10702,whole family loves this hot chocolate we went through the entire box in less than a week it is smooth creamy chocolate delight and if you combine it with a k cup of coffee it makes a perfect cafe mocha must buy more more more,chocolate delight
10703,when i got my coffee maker there were only two cocoa cups in the mix of coffee how delighted i was for amazon to offer br cup purchases really great idea,i love cocoawhen i
10704,very disappointed in this heed the bad reviews i am now at the lowest amount of brewing and it still tastes watered down need to dump some swiss miss hot chocolate in there to give it flavor and that point what was the purpose with the product already being overpriced shop elsewhere as it was and tasting watered down it just was not worth it skip it maybe a different brand will be better,agree watered down overpriced hot chocolate
10705,this is some of the worst stuff i have ever tried to drink it is even worse than that awful stuff that comes out of those machines where the cup drops down and fills it i tried it on the various cup size settings with my keurig machine and it just goes from bad to horrible when going from the larger size to the smallest br br it a complete waste of money br br i just tried another brand that is similar and it is no good either if you like chocolate water buy these if you have it in mind that you are buying hot chocolate with a milky or creamy flavor that is not what this stuff is br br yuck,yuck chocolate flavored water is what you get not good at all
10706,even though the little ones liked this product i thought it was bland and not much flavor to it i will not buy more of these,not much flavor
10707,this time forget ordering through amazon you can get the same product k cups for at big cat or for at keurig these prices are a rip off,
10708,i used the small cup setting and even opened up the cap and scraped the excess mix out of the cup and it is still very weak tasting,too weak
10709,i am diabetic and i do not like artificial sugar but i really like this hot chocolate sweet enough and also has enough chocolate flavor i love it,yummy
10710,i love this cocoa i place it in my kurig with c of water make the cocoa and add another hot milk so creamy great taste it is still good with water but the milk adds a creamy texture yum,alternate use
10711,i would not order these k cups again maybe i am spoiled with godiva hot chocolate but i think swiss miss hot chocolate has more chocolately flavor than these k cups and i would not waste my money on these it comes out a pinkish color that is not appetizing at all,not so chocolately
10712,the green mountain hot cocoa is a good choice for a nice quick cup hot chocolate from our a href http www amazon com gp product b aqpmha keurig b b elite gourmet single cup home brewing system a here are my observations br br good on small cup size a little weak on the large cup setting br shakeup the k cup before using a good tip from another reviewer br my wife and kids really enjoy it with peppermint coffeemate flavoring added br br recommended br br cfh,good hot cocoa recommended
10713,i love green mountain coffee i use it all the time for my k cups i got a sample of the green mountain hot cocoa and thought it would be the best i actually threw it out i tried several times to drink it it tasted bitter and like chemicals i have tried samples of the other brands of hot cocoa and this by far was the worst i was so surprised because i adore their coffee i personally would not recommend this maybe it is the soy i do not know it just tasted very very odd i still would recommend their coffees though just to be fair i did add chocolate redi whip but i add that to all of my hot cocoa and it always tastes good,not so good
10714,even after shaking the cup and only using ounces of water this hot cocoa pretty sure there is not a lick of real chocolate in it still tastes horrible,these are horrible
10715,received a keurig brewer for christmas and also received a pack of this hot chocolate with it we made some after sledding one day for myself my husband and kids and all thought it was terrible we almost returned the keurig brewer because of it i have found that i am enjoying black coffee with my keurig but we will never buy any type of hot chocolate k cups again,watered down hot chocolate
10716,i have tried times to make cocoa with this product twice it appeared to plug the coffee maker and would only provide about one once of cocoa the other two times the product worked correctly i do not think it is the coffee maker problem because it has made dozens of cups of coffee with no problems so i can not recommend this product,problem with making the cocoa
10717,i received my product in a timely fashion and was exactly what i expected i would recommend this to anyone,great product service
10718,i remember going with my mother to payless drug store which has turned into cvs pharmacy here on the west coast payless used to sell these in the s and while the packaging is different now the candy is still the same boy are these good my mom got me hooked on them and on the milk and honey ones too and i just love them now just as much as when i was i am so glad to find these the honey inside is very good and the outside tastes like lovely solid honey i love ordering this larger pack since i can just grab a bar and tuck it into my purse and and eat these as a light snack or to freshen my breath if you love putting honey on toast or just eating it out of the jar you will probably like these the honey inside is a light honey not dark just in case that matters to you,just like from when i was a kid
10719,i remembered these honey candies from when i was a child and ordered a box they were exactly like i remembered great honey flavor and liquid center i shared them with friends and family and am ordering my second box i also like them for when i have a cold or allergies and have that throat tickle this is the hard candy you will find in my purse,just like i remembered
10720,i have been looking for these great candies for years every now and then i would come across them in a candy store it is so nice to know i can now order them on line at amazon and always have honees on hand to enjoy and share with others i love the honey filling try them jane,great candy treats
10721,i had not seen these candies in my neighborhood for a long time i developed a cough and nothing was working i tried to find these because i just had a feeling they would work i could not find them anywhere so i searched amazon and viola here they are they are a great candy and the drop of honey inside really soothes the throat my whole family loves them and everyone i offer them to try like them a lot i think amazon will get a lot of new orders for these,glad i found these again
10722,i first found these at a local deli but they freqently were out of stock so i was thrilled to find them on amazon these are very satisfying and i have great fun introducing friends and co workers to them br br i also frequently recommend them to people with sore throats or coughs honey is an antibacterial agent and very soothing so these make an excellent lozenge in addition to being a wonderful candy br br i bought a case so i can hand them out to people having a bad day,cannot get enough
10723,if you miss and crave the honey pine brothers cough drops you are going to love the honees honey candy i also love that they are imported from italy it is nice to see something other that made in china,rich honey goodness
10724,been looking for these for years so glad i finally found them just like i remembered from my childhood,just like i remembered
10725,i love these they are just the right amount of sweetness and i really enjoy the fact that each piece is individually wrapped,great candy
10726,love them br it took me forever to find these br everyone who i have given them to to try has loved them want more br shipping is on the high side though,sweet as honey
10727,just a perfect transaction i cannot buy this candy anywhere in my town so this was a great find,perfect
10728,all tom douglas rubs are great but i have no idea why they are listed for here you can buy them for about in seattle grocery stores or at tom douglas website,very good rub but do not buy it at
10729,this cereal is awesome and our very favorite of all of the nature path cereals we love it and buy it in multiple boxes,the best cereal we every had please keep up the good work
10730,i just bought a oz box of this at sam club yesterday for and the reason i looked it up on the internet today is because it is not good i checked and the expiration date on the box says best if used by feb i bought it jan wth the raisins in it are so hard they could break your teeth the flavor is unimpressive the packaging was so hard to open i had to get scissors and then use a zip lock bag because my attempts at opening it no matter how carefully i tried caused me to rip the bag i doubt i will need to worry about keeping it fresh as i will probably not eat it again and i do not think it is very fresh to begin with yeeeuuukkkkk and what is with this price is it a joke,the price are you kidding
10731,i really enjoyed this product it tastes good and is very close to the russian or iranian versions also the service and quick delivery were an added bonus i would highly recommend this product,excellent quality and value
10732,guys do you know what malossol means in russian br lightly salted br this particular caviar was actually over salted quite a bit br other than that its a very good tasting caviar i guess you can blame a puddlefish for that very close to russian sturgeon caviar,malossol
10733,received this item as expected if anyone has had peanut porridge this is as close as it gets to jamaica,so nice to get a piece of home
10734,good deal better than buying at the local craft store and even better than the online cake supply stores item arrived as promised and will be useful when making spider and turkey cupckaes during the fall baking season,good deal
10735,this product does not smell very well to me in fact i have to use a fork to tenderized the pieces for my old kitty cat,sliced hard chicken hot dogs for cats
10736,my cat loves this first time i have found a cat food that he will eat and every time i go in the kitchen he thinks br its time to eat,cat lover
10737,what self respecting cat is not a picky eater i have never met any my cat likes whiskas choice cut foods mainly for the gravy and sometimes for the meat omar the magnificent and wonderful likes both the beef in gravy or tuna truth be told his dry crunchie is really his go to choice but he is that way with all prepared moist foods if you ask him his true five star preference is meat caught fresh in the garden let us skip the details you do not want to know let us just say that omar m w is on the job br br i personally prefer whiskas foods in pouches because omar is ok with allowing any remaining food to be left in pouch when stored in fridge rather than having to transfer it from a can to a glass container come on you all have cats that expect you to do this pouches are easy to dispose of too just rinse and trash you are not messing with storing smelling cans and trips to the recycling center,good cat food without smelly cans
10738,this cat food is very delicious that my cat loves the product every time i open the pouch my cat will come wanting to eat it please try this product with your cat if you have not done so yet it is good for cats that are picky eaters,good cat food
10739,my cat will only eat the whiskas choice cuts with beef my local stores quit carrying this product and i bought any cat food similar to it regardles of price my cat ate only dry food for two months or more he lost weight that he cannot afford to lose i am so happy that i found this whiskas item on amazon,happy cat
10740,it is hard to get just one falvor of this product i was very happy to order pouches however when they arrived the out side of the box label was turkey in gravy but they contained mixed grill instead i could not return but amazon gave me a total refund if you are ordering this wait about days after so you do not receive mixed grill like i did it was labeled wrong from the factory so it will take them a while to get new shippments,my cat favorite flavor
10741,another popular seafood flavor that sophie and samson will not share when i bend down to place their bowls in front of them they are on their back legs trying to get to it before i can put the bowl on the floor they act like they have not been fed in days nothing will disturb them not even their favorite ups man who brings them treats cannot beat amazon prices,they run me over to get their cod and shrimp
10742,every day is thanksgiving at sophie and sam dinner mat when they receive their whiskas turkey and giblets in gravy they are quick to devour it and clean each other right after eating i know they hope to pick up a piece hidden in the fur i only buy from amazon because of their awesome prices,cats love it
10743,both my cats love whiskas in any flavor my female cat sophie is usually the one that takes little bits until it is gone when she hears me tearing the whiskas pouches she flys into the kitchen and waits patiently for her food she never lifts her head up from the bowl until every piece is gone she will then sit by her brother samson to get more food if he leaves after he gulps his food down and see his sissy waiting for some of his he will tease her by taking one piece of his food out with his paw look at her and when she trys to take it away he puts his paw on it and scoops it into his mouth i can always count on empty bowls when i buy whiskas the price at amazon is more reasonable than the grocery store,my cats go crazy
10744,cats love this stuff one pouch does not go far so it is more of a treat than a meal unless you feed according to recommendations on box br br pouches are easy to open and a little messy always seems to get on my fingers br br my cats come running if they see me reach for the pouch or they hear the sound of flicking it back and forth before opening br br all the yucky stuff think fast food for cats must be addicting because they seem to listen for the very quiet sound of the rustling pouch we give pouches as a treat,cats love it
10745,they love it i give my kitties silki and tuffy half a pouch each as a mid day snack to keep thier bird terrorizing energy level up i gave it stars only because it is a little messy to tear open sometimes and i do not use scissors because you have to clean them afterwards oh well they do love it,they lovbe it
10746,our beloved bengal kitty isabel is years old and suffering from kidney stones which are inoperable in felines for years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she would eat she might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years br br so we offered her one soft food after another she turned up her nose at the expensive vet sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another finally to her gustatory delight and our great relief she made her choice this particular wiskas version is the only kind she will eat day in and day out it must be whiskas with the turkey and giblets in gravy the gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she cannot resist br br we surmise that like humans our pets have food preferences linked to palate pleasing aroma and taste this whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our izzy no it is not the best choice for managing kidney stones but she is got to eat so you will not worry that we are ignoring her renal problems she is on daily medication and is doing quite well br br it not an inexpensive cat food but its packaging is very convenient and space saving the amazon auto ship program is a life saver the cartons always arrive on time and the per package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities also our local target was the only place we could find this exact variety and now the store no longer carries it remember our cat demands giblets and gravy and accepts no substitutes br br give autoship a try the price is better and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether,tasty food for a picky cat
10747,my finicky cats are difficult to please particularly when it comes to their food br boy was i finally relieved when they chowed down on these,they like em they like em
10748,my cat will eat nothing but whiskas beef in gravy cat food being able to order and receive it through the mail has been a blessing i get it for my mom because she cannot drive to the store because of her health issues its great not to have the extra burden of getting cat food her cat is her companion through hard times,my cat loves whiskas beef in gravy
10749,i have two big cats that are over lbs each for breakfast i give them each a packet of whiskas choice cuts they inhale the food in about minutes this food does not have that catfood smell that most canned foods have there is a lot of gravy so the price is pretty high considering the amount of liquid a href http www amazon com gp product b kib k friskies cat food favorites flavor variety pack ounce pouches pack of a are more expensive and very similar br br i have these on subscribe and save so the price is pretty good based upon my cats reaction they really like this food,my cats come running
10750,i bought this product because my older cat stopped eating the wellness dry and wet food i usually fed her she likes this food and she begs for it every morning and evening when it is time for her meal the ingredients are not quality ingredients but this food is keeping my kitty satisfied,poor quality ingredients but my cat loves it
10751,i adopted a yo cat from a woman who had a premature baby with a lung condition she is skinny and will eat very little besides wiskas i think it is soilent green for cats i would never feed this to her if she would eat anything else i do not think she is long for this world,horrible stuff but it is all the cat will eat
10752,my mom had gotten some of the dollar store knockoffs they were not bad and they certainly were cheap but the look on her face when i gave her these was worth every penny br br although i think she is managed to eat most of them in a couple of weeks and still stays lbs lol,bought for my wonderful mother
10753,as you can see by the pic i posted you get your moneys worth i am very happy with my purchase they are exactly as described and delivered fast i have already purchased another one,pumpkins lots of pumpkins
10754,great cheese wonderful flavor made my spaghetti meatballs better than it is ever been made the lasagna even better fast delivery,fantastic cheese
10755,i use this low sodium seasoning blend all of the time i just add it to a dish at the end of preparation for a punch of flavor the roasted garlic is milder than fresh so you do not have to worry about the usual raw garlic flavor which makes it perfect to sprinkle over soups salads baked potatoes dips etc it has it onion red and green peppers and additional ingredients in it br br still an excellent product but not worth the new price i will not be reordering,adds a great punch of flavor
10756,this product is the absolute best for bar b queing meat the roasted garlic turns the trick it is a little pricey about twice as much but amazon did have a nice discount that makes it more palatable,great
10757,my husband has used this seasoning for years we bought it through sam then could never find it again i thought why not look on amazon and as usual there it was i love this site the bottles are large and well worth the money it is just the best seasoning,best seasoning
10758,this is a great spice for almost anything we use it on meats in soups and it makes a spicey garlic bread we have been using it for some time and will continue to use it,great spice
10759,a href http www amazon com gp product b eq durkee roasted garlic seasoning blend ounce containers pack of a br this seasoning turns any meat or vegetable into a tasty treat,great stuff
10760,i use this on steamed simmered vegetables greens peas and beans roasted meat and poultry and in cold meat salads chicken ham turkey and tuna br it adds just the right combo of flavor with or without other spices you may want to add very glad amazon offers this pack on the subscribe and save program,excellent flavor enhancer
10761,i have been looking for this i had one from sam sometimes ago when i returned to sam they do not have it anymore sam is always a hit or miss br br i search the web and found it in amazon i am so glad to find it i used this every where from stir fried vegitable to bake fish grill steak chicken and shrimp it taste great it is just the right amount of simple spice with low sodium,great mixture of spice
10762,wonderful product thank goodness amazon has this as it is hard to find in my area a little goes a long way,just glorious
10763,this was the first time i had quail it was done for passover the quail was a great addition the to lamb,great things comes in small packages
10764,i am writing this review on behalf of my husband who is the actual starbucks via decaf italian roast coffee drinker because of some health concerns he has been drinking only decaf coffee for well over a year he recently had problems after having a couple cups of what was supposed to be decaf at a restaurant we believe regular coffee was brewed in what was supposed to be the decaf pot at a recent visit to our local starbucks which is miles away i discovered the via decaf italian roast and bought a three pack for him to try he likes strong good coffee and was impressed after his first cup he took two packages to a meeting last night so he could have coffee too when the rest of the group was having real coffee and drank both of them and came home wishing he had more of the via i have placed a pre order for the pack available through amazon and from now on when we travel he will be carrying a supply of decaf italian roast via with him so he will know for sure the coffee he is drinking is decaf it seems expensive until you look at what you would pay for a cup of mediocre coffee at any restaurant,great cup of coffee
10765,i love this stuff there is not an instant coffee out there that is anywhere near this good this is not even in the same category as any other instant it actually tastes like real coffee shocking but true it is no lie almost as good as freshly brewed starbucks it is also great for iced coffee and for adding to smoothies and other recipes that call for a coffee kick however the stuff is so darned expensive that i feel foolish buying it unfortunately it has to be a special splurge when my budget allows,love it but pricey
10766,i would rate starbucks ready brew coffee quite high they are very easy to use and i like the flavor a lot i use them at work where i only want one cup of coffee and hate to have to use and wash my whole coffee pot,great flavor and so easy to prepare
10767,i am a major coffee drinker i love this coffee it is my favorite instant coffee you cannot even tell it is instant i recommend this to anyone who likes coffee and would enjoy the conveinence of having it ready in an instant,awesome instant coffee
10768,i love starbucks via nice to have around when you do not want to make a pot of coffee and you do not want to spend to get a k cup machine there is a slight amount of grit to the coffee from the micro ground beans mixed in with the instant crystals however the taste is worth it and not really bothersome i wished starbucks would make more decaf varieties and more local grocery stores carried it,delicious starbucks decaf
10769,i am nursing and miss having coffee so much br br i heat up skim milk in the microwave pour some agave and a pack of starbucks via decaf br it tastes soooo good like a latte,delicious great for breastfeeding mommies
10770,if starbucks had a decaf tassimo i would pass this up howeever they do not so i use it to make ice coffee pretty good although i would have preferred another drak roast over italian roast,starbucks decaf instant
10771,love this via product after a pregnancy filled with morning sickness i was not sure i would ever get my taste back for coffee but my baby was not too old before that old craving came back but i did not want to drink high octane stuff as a nursing mom so was mainly drinking decaf hot tea when i found these on sale i decided to give it a try i am glad i did i have moved on to making pots of dunkin decaf at home for everyday drinking but i love these via for travel or just an afternoon cuppa i do wish there were more options in decaf flavors,wish there were more decaf options
10772,i wanted to drink coffee again but cannot take caffeine i am very pleased with the a href http www amazon com gp product b qbcur starbucks via ready brew decaf italian roast coffee by starbucks coffee a good taste no noticeable caffeine and lots easier to make than brewing and its fairly easy to make iced coffee as well,better than a lot of brewed coffees
10773,we live out of the country and if you can believe it there are no starbucks anywhere near us when friends come to visit us we ask them to bring us a supply of via ready brews it is almost as good as the freshly brewed it has a great aroma and big taste we love it,just like home
10774,i recommend using half water and half skim milk i usually mix oz water with oz skim milk and heat in the micro for two minutes add the packet and sugar or sweetener great for a quick cup of coffee without the hassle of cleaning the machine,actually tasty
10775,i bought this to keep in my desk at work as our coffee is pretty bad as long as you do not use too much water anything over oz this makes a fast flavorful cup i much prefer this to sanka the other instant alternative offered at work,very flavorful for instant coffee
10776,great and simple product is replacing my k cups and goes with me everywhere simple fast convenient affordable and so much better than most products out there you wonder how long before there is some serious competition,via starbucks
10777,i was a huge skeptic when this first came out but no longer i cannot get over how good this instant coffee tastes it is better than what i can grind and brew myself i have these on my desk at work now for making decaf ice coffee in the afternoons it costs of what they would charge me at the store and i can get decaf awesome i am truly shocked how good this coffee is br br i just wish they sold it in large containers for making full pots,surprisingly awesome
10778,do not waste your money buy the real cup of coffee and spend the time and money at a coffee shop,nothing like the real cup of coffee at starbucks
10779,despite the other review this is the best bbq sauce i have ever had it is a mustard based sauce so if that is not your thing move on it is not really that spicy used to be called habanero sauce in fact that would be my only complaint as much i love shopping amazon buy this direct from their website if you are going to order bottles or more it is cheaper it is great on pulled pork and burgers try it,to each their own but my favorite
10780,this is the very worse bbq suace i have ever tasted and bought i saw the man v food show which featured the stomach bile tasting thin sauce and then bought it wow texas really does not know bbq sauce,bile juice
10781,we fed this to our bulldog when she was a puppy and at first she did wonderful then the corn and preservatives took their toll she was itching and had a chronic ear infection and her face had a terrible yeasty smell all the time she licked her paws constantly and scratched her face raw on any surface she could find then she started vomiting we had to change her food now she eats a fully carnivorous raw diet and is thriving no more itching no more ear infections no more yeast no more paw licking,has corn in it
10782,great food my lab puppy loves it veterinarian recommended br br free shipping with amazon prime no tax less than petco priceless,great
10783,my dogs love this food do well on it the quality price are decent for the royal canin brand the kibble is small enough for smaller breeds i recommend this if you cannot afford the pricier breed specific formulas i hope amazon can keep this size on hand for the price with free shipping i will definately keep buying it,great product
10784,i have two australian cattle dogs very high energy breeds i have tried all foods from solid gold to canidae and have had mixed results with both of those foods i have tried the regular royal canin medium breed and both of my medium sized dogs lbs seem to like the puppy food there waste deposits seem to have gone down and there coats and behaviors have never been better both on royal canin for years no vet bills beautiful coats and best of all the dogs attitudes have never been better,nothing but the best dry food
10785,royal canine is a great product jake loves it he is now months br br a href http www amazon com gp product b viy kw royal canin dry dog food medium puppy formula pound bag a old and pounds boxer puppy,great puppy food
10786,great food we have a english bulldog and he loves his food healthy for him it was suggested by the breeder we bought him from,love this dog food and so does our puppy
10787,i was very pleased with the shipping of this item when i thought it was going to arrive after my food was empty it had actually come days prior my dog could not be happier,good quality dogfood w fast delivery
10788,like another reviewer here i use this granulated honey for my tea and i use it for my coffee it is oh so much better than white sugar i had been in the habit of using the unprocessed sugar which was good but this is so much better br br this product does indeed give backed goods a bit of a different in a positive way flavor and i use it with cookies i buy my granulate honey at a local health food shop and the price here even if you consider the shipping is quite competitive the other advantage is that this stuff is becoming more and more popular in my area and our local shops are forever running out of it it is nice to know i have a reliable source br br highly recommend this product,a wonderful product
10789,i love this stuff i keep it next to the brown white sugar in the cupboard i use it in home made bread br br my kids like it mixed with milk although it does not easily dissolve i let them make a little honey milk on the nights they have trouble falling asleep because i heard that both milk honey have something in them that makes you sleepy anyway it seems to get them back into bed pretty well br br best use is for tea i drink tea at work it is very easy to take this to work with me in a little container and it is a whole lot better than white sugar,great for tea
10790,this is wonderful if i could have given the honey granules a i would have it tastes great no sticky mess my grandkids say that the taste is magic in their hot cereals,omg i will be buying more
10791,the one big problem being that they do not always send you the right product and when that happens there is no way to return it for the right product i ordered lbs of the honey and received brown sugar instead when i tried to return it for the right product the honey i got absolutely no response none i sent countless emails but nothing it is a great product with a great taste but the company is a little dodgy so be careful,there is only one big problem
10792,product was shipped ultra quick usps priority packaged in no tamper bag this granulated honey is great in oatmeal cooking coffee tea on cereal etc it is sweeter than sugar i give seller an a,great product
10793,i use this as a replacement in recipes that call for sugar makes wonderful cakes and cookies i have never had any problem with my orders,love this stuff
10794,sky is the limit with this stuff i have used it in rubs marinades baked goods salads it is a permanent addition to my spice rack,excellent product
10795,i wanted to give this product a try as the liquid honey crystallized in a few weeks during the winter months this small oz packet does clump together a lot more than other sweeteners so there is less of an advantage over using honey in a jar and spooning out the crystallized honey br br for the price i consider it a poor value taste is ok but nothing to rave about and not as good as with regular unprocessed honey,expensive considering the tiny amount provided
10796,this honey granules is tasty and a welcome alternative to cane sugar i use it in my morning oats steel cut oats bird custard and tea one or two teaspoonfuls go a long way it is better stored in the refrigerator consider it in place of over processed store bought cane sugar,tasty alternative to cane sugar
10797,i wanted to try this type of powered honey for my tea it is very good and a great alternative to sugar works very well in tea,good stuff
10798,this honey was very good used it in cookie recipe like brown sugar and the cookies came out delicious thank you,loved it
10799,i like to use honey a lot but sometimes it is difficult to use liquid gooey honey honey does not produce the negative effects in my system that sugar does i use this granulated honey in many foods that need sweetened and even in my coffee it is great tasting and works great,fabulous unique product
10800,this is a wonderful product use it in eggs meatloaf spaghetti sauce everythng i have eaten them out of the jar o,horray for peppers
10801,when i need to cook some onions and peppers without having to saut eacute them first this is perfect they taste great and add so much delicious flavour to food,love this product
10802,i cannot find this product in my local stores but did find them on amazon price is what i expected from my last grocery store purchase only thing i wished they used the usps flat rate shipping otherwise i am completely satisfied and will purchase again in the future,as expected
10803,although i am a little embarrassed touting something so processed maybe it is a reaction to a childhood eating peanut butter my parents hand ground at their local health food store i have to say i really like this stuff it is also the only peanut butter my year old daughter will eat can t get any other brands past her the reduced fat aspect of it may not save calories but it gives the product a slightly sweet taste and for some reason only the skippy brand maintains its smooth texture every other brand i have tried gets tough or grainy patches in it this product is getting harder to find in supermarkets and when i do find it it is at a premium price so the availability on amazon is great,a family favorite
10804,give yourself the gift of buying the regular skippy although this gives you less fat there is a distinct taste difference we will eat what we purchased but i am still in disbelief that such a minimial amount of fat reduction in a product really makes a great pb turn into a yuckky pb,we will eat it however
10805,this is my favorite pb it is really full of peanut taste and i feel that it is reduced fat because there is less oil added,peanutty licious
10806,this is just like the smooth reduced fat skippy peanut butter you would buy in stores br br these are the small ounce size but the price is a good deal or at least it was when i bought it br br sure even reduced fat peanut butter is not the healthiest thing on earth but it is certainly healthier than some of the alternatives,what can i say it is good creamy peanut butter
10807,me and family love this brand of peanut butter cant stand the tast of others and enjoy the free sjhipping from amazon,the best pb ever
10808,i like creamy peanut butter however this is hard to spread because part of the oils are kept out to make it reduced fat kinda makes for a messy sandwich,yummy but hard to spread
10809,this peanut butter is the best and only peanut butter i will eat i refuse any other kind i particularly enjoy the skippy reduced fat because a it is a tad healthier and b it has a sweeter taste to it my local grocery store no longer carries it so i was ecstatic to see it available on amazon and in bulk d,the best
10810,i am a peanut butter fanatic and i get excited every time amazon offers a bulk order of peanut butter at a low price i use peanut butter as a mid day energy boosting snack straight off the spoon and without any other food to supplement it it is just that good to me br br i was more than happy with skippy reduced fat creamy i like the smooth texture it has and it has a great mouth feel that is not the thick stick to the roof of my mouth kind that requires a glass of milk to be able to eat i do not feel that skippy reduced the flavor from its original peanut butter along with the fat to make this product it tastes delicious and satisfying br br if you are a peanut butter lover like me please look out for the fantastic prices amazon has on skippy reduced fat creamy you will not regret buying it and the reduced fat intake is a bonus,tasty and with reduced fat awesome
10811,i started buying skippy several years ago after reading a number of consumer reviews that gave it a top ranking the one that stuck with me the most was a polling of year olds who gave skippy peanut butter a resounding recommendation for its tastes and texture in writing this review i went back and checked to see what more adult reviewers think i am taking the liberty of quoting from the cookinglightly website so far as its review of creamy br br the roasted peanuts on the ingredient list are evident in the heady aroma and balanced flavor testers thought this sample was a touch oily but spread the best makes the perfect peanut butter sandwich but can turn into a savory dressing when mixed with soy vinegar and crushed red pepper to serve over sugar snap peas broccoli or a stir fry for a sweet version mix with honey and mayonnaise and use as a fruit salad dressing mix with chile paste with garlic sambal oelek or sriracha for an easy sauce for roast meats br br this is my opinion too and while the above review was for the regular creamy it applies in my opinion to the reduced fat version just as well i love this peanut butter i know that jif and peter pan are also often ranked highly but skippy is by far my preference br br while i use it on sandwiches i often just eat a tablespoon or two as a quick snack and source of protein it is so good in this role that i gave it to a diabetic friend she uses it in lieu of orange juice if she is starting to feel hypoglycemic the peanut butter stays with her longer and has a smoother effect br br i will note that some nutritionists are now raising questions abou he value of reduced fat peanut butter they have two asic points br br the process of removing fat is n fact removing monounsaturated oils which are healthy for us br br to compensate for any loss of taste manufacturers are putting back in sugars and oils which may not e so healthy br br my rating is based on taste and texture i am not taking a position in nutritional debates but do suggest that you check these matters out separately if you are concerned about this kind of issue,top of the line so far as reduced fat peanut butters
10812,i have always been a fan of skippy peanut butter and i love that amazon is offering buying in bulk at a great price it is cheaper here than what i find in the store i highly recommend it as long as you have a place you can store the extra cans,great bargain
10813,i bought this by accident then decided to give it a chance not worth it i would rather have less real peanut butter than eat this it has a gritty consistency because of the sugar and tastes too sweet and not pea nutty it was more sugary sweet than tasting like peanut butter and the gritty texture just turned me off maybe because it was creamy br i would like to find a pb with less fat but still enjoy it this was not it for me,not worth it
10814,this is the best reduced fat creamy peanut butter i have tasted my whole family loves it we it by the case great food,great skippy reduced fat peanut butter
10815,this is the first redued fat peanut butter that i have thought was a good peanut butter i will buy it again when this is gone,tasty reduced fat
10816,i do not buy this because of the fat content i honestly find that it tastes better than the skippy full fat and does not get those oily collections that the full fat gets highly recommend this product if you love peanut butter,great flavor
10817,this is the only peanut butter that i eat i love the low fat skippy,yummy
10818,this pb tastes good and is goood for you it makes good sandwiches i only wish it were in stock more often,tasty
10819,this oatmeal is extremely filling and has a hearty consistency impressive for an instant oatmeal i know br br the flavor is somewhat bland which allows one to be creative with add ins i prefer to add raisins dried cranberries and or cinnamon to mine br br the nutritional information is great especially the plant derived omega and added whole flax seeds but i wish there was less added sugar in it though br br all in all i am happy this is my breakfast every morning as i get myself off to a healthy start each day,favorite oatmeal
10820,for the uninitiated evaporated cane juice is just sugar by another name another product that tries to present itself as healthy but is not really eating something that lists sugar as the second ingredient is not what i would consider to be a healthy start for the day,sugar is the second ingedient
10821,it is true if he does not get his delicious breakfast oatmeal he freaks out so we buy it by the case and everyone stays happy it is a better price than our local grocery br br this is a great easy hot cereal with plenty of fiber and other good stuff despite all the added seeds the flavor is still basic enough to support add ins like dried fruit brown sugar honey etc it is also good plain and will keep you satisfied all morning i also like this brand cold cereals,my sweetheart is addicted to this
10822,almost every morning i reach for the organic hot oatmeal hemp plus it has more body than the typical grocery store instant oatmeal it is rich in whole grains and full of fiber it is not too sweet i usally add a teaspoon of my favorite sweetener i highly recommend this product,wonderful breakfast cereal
10823,i like it a lot great taste not too sweet perfect way to start the day,good stuff
10824,hemp foods are great the slightly nutty taste is always something i enjoy i almost rated this item four stars because it does not have a strong hemp seed taste but after some thought it is probably best that way br br i add a bit of brown sugar and one packet will fill me up not true with most other oatmeals,very tasty
10825,very yummy i used to eat the variety pack from this same brand but i love this flavor so much i eat it every day it is especially yummy with coconut oil added in love nature path,delicious and filling
10826,so somehow diamond captured the perfect flavor of french toast without all the calories such a great flavor after tasting only a few for the first time i immediately orderd three more these do not even have that almond aftertaste it finishes very nice with a hint of a butter maple flavor wow br br now to diamond please rename to buttery french toast as this would be much better fitting,great breakfast flavor
10827,the flavor of these nuts is similar to cinnamon toast cereal yet they are filling and healthy containing little sugar and almost no salt i would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket but blue diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost br br the other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose the ingredients br almonds evaporated cane juice brown sugar corn maltodextrin cinnamon natural flavors and salt peanut free may contain other tree nuts unless other tree nuts comes from cows i do not think this is true,unique product well executed
10828,i ordered these nuts off a whim because of the flavor i just got into eating more nuts because i do not get enough omega everybody that i shared these with loved them i went through containers in a week because of sharing this will be a staple in my house from now on,great snack
10829,these have more net carbs than the emerald cocoa roast almonds g vs g but if you are not worried about that these are absolutely delicious if you like flavored nuts you have got to try these,absolutely delicious
10830,i discovered these nuts by accident they were on clearance ay my local cvs for i wish i had bought them all br the cinnamon and brown sugar flavor is perfect together with the roasted almond flavor it is not candy coated like other cinnamon almonds making it a much healthier treat everyone that i have shared them with think that they are br phenomenal i highly recommend this product it is one of the most tasty and healthy snacks you can find i only wish amazon would put them on their subscribe and save program,simply the best
10831,at the time of purchase the production description stated br br blue diamond natural cinnamon brown sugar oven roasted almonds oz br by blue diamond br be the first to review this item like br list price br price oz br you save br br product description br blue diamond almonds oven roasted cinnamon brown sugar pack br br both the list price and description suggests that it is a pack br br i ordered and received packs br this is a single oz container,incorrect information
10832,i got these at my local publix they are the best tasting almonds of the bunch the butter toffee tastes natural and the almonds are of good quality they also make dark chocolate covered almonds they taste like cocoa puffs but are still pretty good if you are looking for a cocoa kick instead,best snack ever

10834,at first i thought these tasted a little artificial after a few handfuls i realized i like them regardless br br i am a big fan of this company products and have even gone so far as to speak with one of their growers about the integrated pest management systems they employ using the smallest amount of pesticides possible i will keep buying all their other flavors the bold line especially the habanero is also excellent as are the dark chocolate variety,a great little snack
10835,these almonds are nothing short of incredible they are so delicious if you are trying to follow a low carb lifestyle for dietary reasons or weight loss and need a sweet fix after meals then this is a wonderful option only g net carbs and the taste is so yummy they are just sweet enough i am so glad that amazon sells them in bulk because i could easily go through one container in a week,incredible
10836,if you want a truly healthy filling snack you must give these a try as well as their sisters the vanilla bean almonds they are both just lightly sweetened and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla depending on which you choose the container is marvelous there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand like in the car and they are not roasted in more oil so the almonds are meaty and sweet and almonds are sooo good for you i would recommend that you try them and then get an amazon subscribe and save if you can it is well worth it and all natural lovely,healthy and delicious
10837,i expected that these canisters of blue diamond roasted almonds honey would be the same product as the little cans of blue diamond honey roasted almonds a href http www amazon com gp product b zsz pw blue diamond almonds honey roast ounce tins pack of a but they are surprisingly not the same and have a very off taste what a disappointment blue diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and other natural flavors which i suspect cause the odd taste thus ruining a fabulous product br br i ve been having a hard time finding the small cans of blue diamond honey roasted almonds at the supermarkets despite all the other flavors being carried it is as if blue diamond just for some reason wants this product to fail first they make it hard to get the canned version then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words but without a hint that it is not the same product br br i d contact blue diamond and complain but i already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website in the past i wrote to them when they test marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds not slivered but silvered as in almonds with a very light sugary coating when i wrote to ask instead of appreciating my interest as a customer they simply ignored me br br so i am offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake and think that these almonds will be like the similarly named canned honey roasted almonds from the same company the ones in the can are great these are just plain awful and i will be throwing out canisters of purchased,not the same as the canned version
10838,ok i like a little richness these nuts have a flavorful salt taste but are almost too dry to get down your throat,nice salt on a very dry nut
10839,i love these almonds they are my favorite to date and i would definitely buy again the taste is crunchy they are well toasted and the salt that has been added is just perfect not too little not too much best i have ever eaten,the taste is crunchy
10840,this is basically candy masquerading as a healthy snack they taste good because they have three different kinds of sugar in them blue diamond wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack c mon br br i purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia yeah there is a miniscule amount of stevia very last ingredient but sugars are the nd rd and th ingredient listed these have corn maltodextrin the worst thing there is on the glycemic index can you say fat formation now i am stuck with containers of this sugar snack,too much sugar
10841,these are the best tasting almonds i buy them in bulk to share at work any time someone finds cheaper almonds they always come back to these because they cannot be beat,always fresh
10842,i love these almonds they taste just like a snickerdoodle cookie but make for a much healthier snack one of my favorites of the blue diamond oven roasted varieties buying them in a pack is more cost effective for me especially now that i cannot find them in my grocery store i wish they came in the large resealable bag like some of the other flavors but for now i will stick with the container pack,like snickerdoodle cookies
10843,i would not call these almonds sweet but they do have just the right hint of sweet flavor that the almond is elevated and feels like a treat the taste and texture of almonds does not particularly appeal to me but they are such a healthy snack that i am glad to find this delicious option also the small container is the perfect size to have on your desk or keep in the car or use as stocking stuffers like i plan to do for a couple of my healthy eating conscious friends,delicious and healthy treat
10844,i purchased other types of blue diamond almonds on the same day and they were both around for a pack of t his one was only one oz container and i assumed it was at least containers since the cost was over,you are only getting one container
10845,nice sweet treat with some nutritional value these are fantastic the only thing is i can find them in more local store at a lower cost,yummy
10846,i love the blue diamond butter toffee and the chocolate this is my first try with the cinnamon and they are fabulous i eat and live low carb and eat a lot of nuts the flavored blue diamond almonds are hard to find so i am happy to find them on amazon even better to have them delivered to my door fast free thanks amazon and blue diamond,yum
10847,i love salted and smoked almonds i had never even heard of butter toffee almonds before but wow i am glad i tried them they are just sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth without overwhelming you with a sugar taste br another reviewer was right they taste a lot like french toast i am definately buying these again,amazing
10848,ive had some tasty nuts before but these are exceptionaly good try them im very happy with this product,boy these are some tasty nuts
10849,butter toffee is not a flavor i thought i would like for some reason the name makes me think of an icky flavor however i became hooked at first bite this flavor is much sweeter than the honey roasted it certainly becomes my top dessert almonds when in need of that sweet replacement br br absolutely great for those on a low carb or keto diet only net carbs per serving the bold sweet flavor keeps you satisfied after only a small amount br br highly recommended,should almost be labelled a bold flavor
10850,these almonds are my favorite almonds wal mart used to carry them but now i have to order online they are the perfect balance of cinnamon and sugar without being overpoweringly sweet,best almonds ever
10851,the almonds are very very fresh tasting the cinnamon adds an extra bonus of goodness to the almonds with a great flavor we keep them in the fridge we also mix them with all the other nuts we have making our own nut mixture excellent snack with protein br br just ordered some more of them,if you like almonds and you like cinnamon you will like these
10852,i love these for a snack i get a nice taste of chocolate and mint in addition to the almond of course but it is not super sweet i hope blue diamond keeps coming out with more flavors the butter toffee is great too,love the new flavor
10853,great taste the blue diamond flavors are way better than the emerald flavors great between meals snack that we all eat also grab to put in baggies for lunches,a heathly snack we all love
10854,after trying every kind of almond out there over the years i will take these flavorful blue diamond almonds any day they are fresh salted just right and not greasy oily i try to eat a handful a day usually as a mid afternoon snack for optimum health benefits the handy container is easy to use and even indicates portion size unfortunately this type of almonds is getting more and more difficult to find in my local stores so i was happy to be able to order a pack from amazon to have in my pantry,best almonds hands down
10855,these are our absolute favorite almonds and love that there is not any fake sugars in them i will take more calories with real sweeteners any day over sucralose in the other brands and this flavor is delicious yum,our favorite
10856,i ordered these lovely almonds a few weeks ago as i often find myself jonesing for junk food and i thought that if i had something that was good for me around i would be less likely to grab something terrible these nuts are packed with nutrition and they taste amazing they have just enough flavor to make me want more but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting i am satiated with two handfuls i go through one little container every week or so they are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle they pack grams of protein in oz i will definitely be re purchasing these nuts i was not so keen on the idea of the canisters as i do not like producing so much waste but i have purchased nuts peanuts etc in the past in bulk and they did go bad before i finished eating them br these nuts have kept me out of the icecream chocolate chips and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content these nuts taste like they should be bad for you but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food read the back for the nutritional content vitamin e phosphorus magnesium manganese the list goes on br br update i ordered my second shipment of these i love these and i eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins,yummy in my tummy

10861,these are a good thing for you and sometimes hard to find in a larger container at the store so these make it much easier and there a good price here,great value
10862,these are incredible eating these makes me not want to eat candy i love these the price is not that great though i think blue diamond should save money by packaging them in something cheaper than plastic i did notice it on amazon in a box but the price looks odd over too bad amazon does not stock this so no free shipping,awesome
10863,the almonds tastes all right since it is too dry the salt can hardly stay on surface therefore it is not salty enough on the whole it is a healthy snack i hope this type of almonds can have subscription service and discount,ideal healthy snack
10864,i have tried several of the blue diamond jar almonds and the butter toffee almonds are the best they would probably be my favorite almond but they are high carb i guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time we can all do that right br br i agree with the other reviewer who said that the blue diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars my favorite are the vinegar salt but the butter toffee almonds are the exception,butter toffee almonds are sooo good but hi carb

10879,great taste almonds are high in overall fat but low in saturated fats that most contribute to weight gain buy a case they stay pretty fresh when sealed for months,best tasting almonds
10880,so the hottest hot off the press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away and for good reason they are full of b and other vitamins fiber not cholesterol not sodium not empty calories and not tasteless wallpaper paste br br but these these new blue diamond almonds i ve so far tried both the brown sugar cinnamon and the vanilla are soooooo good that it is hard to stop at an ounce this has become my after dinner treat br br to help fight the sodium bugaboo they have instead coated them with a velvet dairy whey based powder take note lactose intolerant folks that is loaded with flavor they are not sweet except the sweetness of the lactose and they are not the least bit salty they taste like a great dessert in both flavor and texture br br thumbs way up licking my fingers kind of up,wow really

10882,these taste exactly like cinnamon toast crunch but with the nutritional composition of almonds they are pretty mind blowing do not be afraid of buying a pack you will need it,cinnamon nom nom noms
10883,sugar coated almonds why do you even need a review if you like almonds and sugar you will like these if you don t you won t,delish
10884,all the star reviews convinced me to buy these i wish i had not it is been two months since i purchased them and i still have four out of the six containers unopened they are just blah now the chili lime flavored almonds from blue diamond on the other hand are mmm mmm good,not a big fan of these
10885,these taste good and are edible but i am only giving star to let people know that this product tastes like pistachios to me not almonds i do not know why if i wanted pistachios i would have bought them i had a craving for almonds and these just do not do the trick they also contain a weird ingredient corn malodextrin why they are almonds all you need is almonds and salt maybe oil so much for being all natural,tastes like pistachios
10886,local retailers stopped carrying the blue diamond honey roasted almonds in the small tins for some time now not planning ahead enough to buy another case i picked up these in hope that oven roasted honey that same goodness not true these almonds are cloyingly sweet they also taste a bit milky but there are no milk products listed which just makes the flavor even stranger they do not have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones however my year old really likes them and while i do not have a container to compare i am thinking that the lack of crusty goodness might make these a somewhat healthier choice for her so i give the product stars an average of from her and from me,not as good as the ones in the tins
10887,the delivery was extremely quick the packaging was fine and if you suck off all the honey the almonds even taste pretty good but i for one do not like this flavor mind you i could eat honey roasted peanuts,not my favorite
10888,so far this is the best cola flavoring i have found for those wanting to make their own cola it is got stevia in it so it still does not taste like coca cola but it is so much better than the nasty cola flavor that sodastream makes and hey no artificial sweeteners is always good br br it does not taste quite like cola but it is close enough to make me happy and i liek it for it is own flavor,best so far
10889,i am looking for a replacement for coca cola and i read the positive reviews here and decided to purchase at my local whole foods there is a gross stevia aftertaste and it tastes nothing like commercial cola it is not good and it is misnamed,no good
10890,i have been a flavrz fan for about a year but all that time i pretty much stuck to the tropical flavored version which was excellent recently i decided to order a couple new flavrz flavors through amazon this cola i think is excellent i have been drinking it just with filtered water really good taste i just wish it was easier to get the stuff,excellent
10891,i am sitting here watching the olympics enjoying my latte and in the national spirit of giving praise this espresso ground is great we moved from california and have been dissapointed with the affordable coffee here in nyc i missed my peet they re tops in flavor and body it is just a godsend to have it arrive fresh and ready to go thanks,a great taste of home
10892,during my recent visit to new orleans in june of i fell in love with etouffee sauce on redfish oh my goodness delicious i picked up a few packages of the louisiana cajun etouffee mix for per package and made it at home it was fantastic i ordered the product on amazon from a particular seller and for the price of more than dollars was delivered one package the product description on the website did not clarify the number of packages to be delivered for this amount i assumed three packages for that price i received one package and returned it to them immediately you can purchase this product on line from the retailer for less than two dollars per package with free shipping so avoid purchasing this via this seller great product however,item is delicious price is ridiculous
10893,this is a rip off found out that you can buy this product for under just about anywhere not the they charge in fact you can go directly to the manufacture and order do not get rip off,stay away from this company
10894,delicious br ideal to eat with fruit and if you want to eat with some chips is not too spicy i like this very much,delicious
10895,i really love my keurig brewer but after my third purchase of highly priced tea and coffee k cups i knew i needed a more cost efficient solution i purchased a my k cup for the unit which allowed me to use regular canned coffee but what was i going to do about the tea i tried opening tea bags and using that tea but it was weak and flat next i tried using this tea and it worked perfect but a word of caution remove the tea leaves from the filter while moist to make removal easier no more brewing an entire teapot for just a quick morning cup and no waiting for tea bags to brew and it tastes great not weak and off taste but perfect my tea consumption has increased to the point that i now use the amazon auto ship to receive boxes at a time so that i never run out if you have a keurig and love tea this product is the perfect solution you will not be disappointed,works great with a keurig brewer
10896,this loose tea is hard to find in stores i had to order it online and discovered it is a better tea than i usually get with an added bonus of being less expensive so i am very pleased i use it only for iced tea so cannot say how it is when hot it is a stronger tea so i use less i hope you continue to carry it because i plan on buying more in the future,lipton loose tea
10897,okay i did not read the description very well i ordered loose tea on accident by loose tea i just thought it still meant it would be in a tea bag i know do not make fun of me i just did not read it well and i am not an expert on tea being frugal like i am i was forced to use the tea anyway i would still like directions on how to make it without a fancy strainer it just went straight through my colander hee hee i put the recommended amount in the coffee maker and brewed it that way it was way too strong i was able to get three gallons of iced tea from the recommended amount for one anyway after a lot of trial and error i now have drinkable tea lipton has always been my favorite tea and after i drink all of this that i purchased i will probably stick with the loose tea frugality wins always,it just takes practice
10898,my family and i have been using this tea for over years i make the best unsweetened tea i have ever had with this tea and get many many compliments on it if you use good water this tea will last for a day or two without refrigeration which changes it is flavor i am in south texas and we take our tea very seriously down here this strong brisk hearty brew is just the thing on a hot summer afteroon i have not experienced stained teeth or other ill effects either using a drip coffee maker to brew it keeps it from overheating and getting bitter it is healthy too with plenty of antioxidants in it is orange black pekoe blend if you try it and it is too strong tinker with your recipe once you get the ratio right you will find it is delicious,great iced tea
10899,i love this tea i am a long time tea drinker and purchased tea bags for longer than i want to count or think about a couple of years ago i decided to go for it make loose tea and deal with mess of leaves and yes i did know about strainers and tea balls but i live in no man s land if it is not prepackaged it is unfit to ingest according to the natives good utensils are hard to find br br i finally found a wonderful big mesh tea ball ahhh a tea drinker best friend right after a good english teapot br br the mesh ball in question is like the one sold here as a rule by the way br br tea is now a breeze to make and absolutely delicious br br the loose packaged tea put out by lipton is wonderful it has a beautiful taste unlike their teabags which can be very iffy i have had some that tasted like floor sweepings br br this loose tea seems amazingly consistent in flavor i recommend it without reservation and is not amazon just lovely they will bring it right to your door how much more could you ask br br earlier i mentioned an english teapot i favor sadler because of the excellent glaze and the good material they use in the functional brown teapots they make br br a good teapot matters get yourself one a nice tea ball and some lipton loose tea and you will likely never use teabags again if the tea is too strong do it the way it is done in england keep a very lightly boiling kettle going and dilute with boiling water to your taste,better tea
10900,lipton loose tea is great for brewing iced tea or hot tea mellow yet intensely flavorful this tea works very well with iced tea makers or coffee brewers i would not use a coffee maker that is been used for coffee though as the coffee effervescence will overpower the tea flavor my only gripe is i would like to see loose tea available in larger packages lipton used to sell it in one pound boxes but now it is only available in pound boxes this six pack helps make up for the problem somewhat we drink iced tea like some people drink their coffee all the time so loose tea works great for us tbsp makes about a gallon it is much easier than messing with a dozen or more tea bags per gallon with the free shipping the price per box is equal to or less than the purchase price in our local grocery stores and wal mart stores and that is with delivery to my front door,delicious flavor loose brew tea
10901,my italian grandmother got me hooked on lipton loose tea as a child tea is important to me i never have gotten into coffee it has been increasingly more difficult to find lipton loose in supermarkets so i have tried to find something to replace it more expensive fancier teas just are not as good this is a great product sooo much better than tea bags we like it hot or iced people always ask me what kind of tea is this and then are so surprised to find out that it is good old reliable lipton tea lovers do not be snobs give lipton loose tea a try thanks amazon for carrying this product,hooray
10902,despite its reputation as the old standby variety of tea lipton compares favorably with other much more expensive brands its loose tea packages are convenient to use and well packaged for maintaining freshness during storage shipment and in the home even after being opened all in all a very superior product,good tea for the tea lover
10903,this is a great product and the only problem we have is the unreliability of finding it on the grocery store shelf with amazon com it is just a mouse click and three days away we keep a supply on hand and reorder from amazon com on a regular basis thanks amazon hank c,lipton loose tea
10904,the product was received on schedule and in perfect condition i have been buying this product and brewing it for years and it is still a great product it is much better tasting than using tea bags,lipton loose tea
10905,i have used lipton loose tea for almost years now and will never change to another brand unless lipton goes out of business the loose tea consistently makes absolutely the best glass of iced tea tea bags any brand are no comparison not even close to the same great flavor of lipton loose leaf tea i have a large extended family with many friends my iced tea is famous among them for being the best thanks lipton and thanks amazon for the wonderful subscription service love it,best iced tea ever
10906,i actually bought a box in walmart it was needless to say inexpensive so i thought it was worth a taste test one cup was barry classic blend loose one cup tetley bag and the other was lipton loose tetley came in a distant distant nd while barry and lipton were tied for first both were very similar in body richness and strength a word of warning don t ever buy cheap in quality loose or bagged tea it will be stems and bits of leaves swept up from the floor at least that is what it looks and tastes like the tea should be just leaves as dark brown as semi sweet chocolate all good and some bad tea is grown in africa india and sri lanka ceylon,comparable to irish breakfast
10907,if you like their teabags this is really worth a try the leaves in the teabags seem to be the tea that is rejected when they package the loose tea this tea has a brighter taste than the tea bag lipton,much better than their teabags
10908,anyone looking for a good tea bargain and excellent quality taste this is the deal i could not find lipton loose tea in the grocery store and longer i found this at amazon on line the price freshness and quality is great i will be buying my lipton tea here from now on everyone wants teabags they really do not know what quaility is thank you very much,best tea in the world
10909,i grew up drinking lipton loose leaf tea and did not even realize there was any other for iced tea until i grew up and left home it is still the best i almost panicked when the stores quit carrying it and was so relieved to find it here i hope amazon reads these reviews and realizes that we need them to keep carrying it and that lipton keeps on making it everyone likes my iced tea and says so and that is because this is the only tea i use,the only tea for iced tea
10910,lipton loose leaf tea beats any other tea i have tried hands down when the local groceries stopped stocking lipton loose leaf tea i assumed lipton had stopped selling it because tea bags were more profitable and people found it easier to use tea bags wrong we have been sold on the idea of convenience and taste took the back seat this tea is packaged in a foil lined package is fresher tasting and very consistant in quailty make it sweet or unsweet it does not matter if you make it too strong just add water the flavor is there you will be amazed as to how many gallons of tea you can make with one box you will need to brew it a few times to figure out your formula it is worth the time i live in an area that has very soft water so i do not need as much product to brew a gallon it definitely takes more if you have hard water br this is how i brew mine this may help you get started using a mr coffee cup measure tablespoons slightly rounded and place in the filter just as you would coffee fill you crafte to the max and brew for sweet tea i use one and cup sugar per gallon it is easier to put the sugar in a gallon pitcher then add the hot liquid the sugar will dissolve completely and you will not need as much sugar when the sugar has dissolved add water or ice to bring it up to a gallon if you are not pleased with the outcome try making some adjustments once you figure it out it becomes routine and is probably one of the the most economial drinks you can make br enjoy br br ps i keep mine in the freezer in a ziplock after i have opened the box,best tea ever grocery stores are crazy for not stocking it
10911,i love the loose tea the bag tea has a harsh taste compared to the loose tea if you drink more than cup a day use a clean never used for coffee coffee pot small cup pots only need tea spoon for weaker a little more for stronger tea,lipton loose tea
10912,we have been using this product for many years of enjoyment in summer my wife uses it for iced tea almost every evening for our supper there is some usually left over so it can be used either hot or cold at a later time even early the following day we read that tea is good for the body too,lipton black tea loose pound boxes pack of six
10913,its hard to beat this for making iced tea it makes a strong tea that manages to quench a thirst on a hot day just dont steep is too long or it will get bitter i find that mins is about perfect,great for iced tea
10914,this is a great product shipping was fast as usual and i plan to keep on getting tea from amazon as long as possible,lipton loose tea
10915,i live way out in the boondocks and even the closest little town stores do not carry liptons loose tea i do not want tea bags for both ecological and economical reasons so the convenience of subscribing to a scheduled shipment at a reasonable price is wonderful for me thank you,convenience and ecology
10916,as others have said lipton loose tea is very difficult br to find in stores i prefer the loose tea to the tea br bags for iced tea i hope amazon continues to offer the br loose tea as i try and stock up when i can,loose tea makes great iced tea
10917,i was so disappointed to find that the two stores i shop in had stopped carrying the loose lipton tea this is the only tea i use there is a difference between it and tea bags and i am thrilled that i can buy it on line and as an added bonus it is cheaper thanks so much,the greatest tea in my opinion
10918,it is very hard to find this product in local grocery stores loose tea is something my wife and i enjoy,tea
10919,great tea if anyone has not tried loose tea they need to because they do not know what they are missing i was very glad to find this product again many thanks for keeping this wonderful beverage fast shipment and great service,great tea
10920,initially i purchased this in good faith for brewing it as iced tea as it is quite difficult to find loose tea leaves in stores here is my initial report and impressions br br the tea leaves came loose of course but the packaging is terrible the bag is not sealed and the flap is just folded so tea leaves came out of the bag while in transport so a lot of your tea leaves will be inside the box which is not good i would hope that in the future lipton chooses a better packaging alternative to seal the bag so you do not have tea leaves all over the place br br and as another reviewer mentioned it is true that this particular brand has little bits and pieces of tea leaves and is not as good quality compared to other brands and as always you pay for what you get i did not expect this to be better than my jasmine tea in a tin can which costs about and taste fantastic my goal was to buy cheap black tea leaves which are loose to make lemon iced tea which i was able to do well with that br br here is my lemon iced tea recipe after a lot of trial and error and taste testing br br gallon of lemon iced tea br br gallon of water br tablespoons of lipton black tea br empty teabags br cup of sugar br cup of lemon juice br br lipton direction call for tablespoons of lipton black tea to make quarts of black tea to drink we know that quarts is equal to gallon if we used tablespoons of black tea we would only end up with quarts of tea which is short of one gallon if tablespoons makes quarts then tablespoon would make about of a quart so you would need at least a minimum of tablespoons or even about tablespoons of tea leaves to get your gallons i would not recommend using more than tablespoons as it would make the tea too strong some people have said that the tea is too strong for the little amount that you use to brew your tea but i would have to disagree with that i thought the tea was not strong enough br br so go ahead and boil your water till you hit the boiling point use between tablespoons depending on how strong you want your tea to be and fill up those empty teabags the directions call for brewing your tea for about minutes being a tea drinker i knew that if i brew it too long that tannins would be released and make the tea bitter yes tannins are what make your tea bitter if your water is too hot or you brew your tea too long the tannins will be released in the leaves making your tea bitter initially i only brewed my tea for about minutes because i was scared that the tea would be bitter if i brewed it too long but i found that minutes time was not enough time and increased my time to about to minutes that is enough time to brew the tea without releasing the tannins so lipton brewing time was about spot on after you finish brewing your tea add your cup of sugar and then your lemon juice i used cane sugar and hy top reconstituted lemon juice but you can use whatever brand you like or you can even use fresh squeezed lemon juice if you want i did try real lemon juice while at another supermarket but i did not like it compared to my generic brand of lemon juice by hy top br br you probably wanted to know if i actually drank the tea without it being lemon iced tea and i did i did not like it nor would i recommend you drink this tea this way i just did not feel that this tea was up to quality compared to many other brands maybe i have just been spoiled by other brands but i just feel that this tea was not up to par against other black teas nor do i recommend drinking it as just plain black tea i particularly like the english breakfast black tea by stash better than this tea i just felt that the quality difference was a lot but i did not feel like buying every bag for each every time i went to the supermarket just to brew lemon iced tea if you want to make lemon iced tea with the stash brand you need english breakfast black tea bags and the same amount of sugar lemon juice and water economical wise i would get more tea buying lipton but if taste matters i would choose another tea brand to make lemon iced tea br br i have not tried making raspberry iced tea with this yet but we will save that for another adventure,great for lemon iced tea
10921,i have always loved lipton teas it is a daily habit i just bought a automatic tea brewer and loose tea for the first time almost immediately i started getting an upset stomach it never occured to me that it could be the tea i have never had a problem like this after a week of stomach problems and tring different solutions i finally stopped drinking the tea immediately my stomach was better a few days later i started drinking the lipton loose tea again and immediately my stomach was upset i looked on the internet and a few suggested i add a bit of honey and a bit of salt i tried that with no success does anyone else have any ideas i hate to throw out six boxes of tea,help my stomach gets upset with this tea
10922,i love this tea i drink it every day of the year my grandma made her tea from this and its the only tea my family drinks,lipton loose tea
10923,as i said loose tea is cheaper than tea bags and the taste is much better and this country boy sure loves his southern sweet iced tea packed well received quickly and rapidly made a pitcher in my mr co ee iced tea maker i keep my tea leaves in an airtight bag in the fridge and use one cc scoop of tea to make quarts of tea you convert it i am tired,loose tea is cheaper than tea bags
10924,my family makes a lot of ice tea during the summer we are not able to find affordable quality loose tea in our community br br lipton loose tea is the best,top quality product for hard to find loose tea
10925,this is the only way to make good good iced tea you will never taste iced tea as good as homemade and it is cheaper on amazon than in the supermarket,loose tea
10926,being married to a person from england as most people know they are known for their custom of having tea in the afternoon and always being made in a tea pot with loose tea it is getting harder too find this in the stores and we are ever so grateful that we can buy it through amazon this is our favorite brewing tea and it tastes great would not get any other and the price is fantastic so if you are a tea lover like we are give it a try br thanks for letting us keep up with tradition,english tradition goes on
10927,i use a little plastic shot glass to brew liters perfectly at the office we love it that is only a few dry grams makes liters of hot tea cannot find this in my local supermarket glad amazon has it,a few dry grams makes liters of hot tea
10928,if you want the best iced tea and most economical tea around make it from this fabulous lipton tea add cups of boiling water to tablespoons of tea seep minutes and pour into cups very cold water serve over generous glass of ice cubes sugarless tea that needs nothing but maybe some lemon wedges you can drink for a month on one box of tea all bottled teas have too much sugar or substitute this is healthy and i have been drinking it for years,best iced tea around
10929,i am very happy that i brought this lipton loose tea as this loose tea is what we had when i was a child and its is still as good as i remember it was then are better tea than any of the other tea that are already in a tea bag the flavor of this tea is what a glass of tea was supposed to be likes i will always buy the loose tea now that i found a supplier i have looked in all of the big name brand super markets and never found any loose tea i got mine order to come in every three month now but may have to get mine order up from one box too two boxes,the best of the rest
10930,i chose to have this tea sent to me automatically thereby saving even more money it is cheaper this way than i can buy at my local store loose tea made with filtered water makes the absolute best tasting iced tea,delicious tea

10935,we use loose tea all the time and regular loose tea has become hard to find in our local grocery stores this subscription is great,love this service
10936,cannot start the day without a pot of this tea loose tea brewed in a coffeemaker has been my morning mainstay for decades start with cold filtered water and a scoop rounded tablespoon of loose tea per cup into the paper basket filter adjust per taste if you use a machine where coffee had been brewed it may affect the taste so use any new machine and keep it just for tea this makes wonderful iced tea br br loose tea is a broader cut leaf unlike teabags where the leaf is chopped fine the flavor is much fuller and crisper like the difference between fresh ground coffee and instant no messy teabags to contend with i like glass mugs as they let the gorgeous color of the tea show through br br some areas may not stock lipton loose tea in stores but buying online turned out to be cheaper six half pound boxes arrived in two days a box will last me about two weeks but i drink tea exclusively there are many good imported teas that are much more expensive and a lovely addition but for my daily enjoyment lipton is a delicious necessity this is the preferred tea when using french presses or a traditional teapot,morning mainstay
10937,fewer and fewer stores carry loose leaf tea and i was so glad to find it on amazon who knew i have become an avid fan of amazon over the last few months it is wonderful to have someone else do the shopping for me and allows me to find products in one place,lipton loose leaf tea
10938,i make my loose tea in a coffeemaker that has never been used for coffee and i use unbleached filters to hold the tea the tea is fresh and so flavorful you wont believe it there is no dust in this tea as in teabags just real tea i dont understand why loose tea is not available everywhere but i am glad to have found this source for it the price is very reasonable especially when compared to other loose teas do a google search for loose tea and you will found out for yourself,the very best way to drink tea
10939,this is a great tea i use a french press to make my tea a lot of people use a coffee maker and i have too in the past br i have found that if you use a french press and hot water from your water dispenser and let it steep as per the instructions this will be the best tea you have had in a long time do not take my word for it try it,great tea
10940,tea tastes great overflows my ice tea maker but worth it i guess tazo is better but much more expensive,love the tea
10941,this is my third order of lipton loose tea it is not easy to find in our local stores so i really like to be able to depend on amazon to provide this product for me excellent product and service and recommend this all,satisfied customer
10942,lipton loose tea a href http www amazon com gp product b em pc lipton loose tea ounce boxes pack of a is a reminder of the way things were when i was a little child my mother all her sisters my grandmother and all our friends considered lipton loose tea to be tea there was no other for them i grew up thinking anything else was an off brand lipton tea is america favorite tea br br in the south most people make it sweet they add the sugar while it is hot so less sugar is required now i prefer to use splenda splenda no calorie sweetener granular ounce resealable bags pack of and lemon juice this tea has a strong black tea taste it is robust and pure br br when i moved across the mississippi river i was shocked to discover that people in louisiana drink their tea three times as strong as they do in mississippi i think one reason my people liked lipton loose tea so much was that we had very little money and we had to make things go as far as possible it was always a good bargain almost any kind of tea is an excellent bargain br br nutritonally it is outstanding it is a means of hydrating which is considered important always hydrate responsibly do not drink too much you would not want to drown also it is an excellent source of flavonoids which provide antioxidants a glass of tea has about half as much caffeine as a cup of coffee since the ingredients vary with different practices it is difficult to estimate the amount of caffeine br some caffeine can help many people br br on my blog which you can find at flavored with love mary lou family and friends can cook i talked about my mother tea and all the spread she used to make when she took food to church for dinner on the grounds the name of the blog entry is myrtle stuffed eggs br br about stains it is helpful to brush and polish your teeth immediately after enjoying this wonderful tea also you can clean glasses pitchers etc with baking soda one more tip is to drink with a straw to try to avoid getting so much of the liquid on your front teeth i do this but i do not think it helps much br br i hope you found this review helpful,boxed nostalgia
10943,lipton tea is around in the local gorcery store if you cand find it,what a deal
10944,the best tea for ice tea a little harder to use than bags but the taste is so much better i make mine in an ice tea pot and it is always perfect i have been drinking it all my life and the quality is always wonderful,great tea
10945,i have been drinking loose leaf tea for a while now and this has to be the worst stuff i have tried yet i believe by fine tea they mean small particle size my box is about the consistency of a box of dirt instead of nice leaf parts following the directions did not produce a pleasant cup of tea there is too much bitterness in this tea i would definitely suggest checking out the adagio teas my mother in law gave me a sampler for christmas and it had some excellent teas,not very good tea
10946,i am a little dis appointed with this tea this was my first experience with loose tea initially this was good loose tea after having tried for several months i am dis appointed first it is a weak tea i have tried brewing it for long time changing my water settings and brew times and i keep getting same result a weak tea the amt of tea i just never seem to get the right mix,tea is a little on weak side
10947,save your money and buy a better quality tea than lipton loose tea tea is better than the bagged version but you will want to pour it through a fine filter before drinking because the leaves are broken and some are just very small particles,save your and buy a better quality tea
10948,there are several types of teas in the world indian ceylon scented teas like jasmine there is oolong black green but one thing binds all these teas together they taste like tea br br this substance has no flavor only an astringent quality it is not drinkable plain which i suppose is why people require all sorts of recipes adding sugar or spices anything to give this tea some flavor and take away the horrid bitterness br br i think it is even worse than the bagged lipton tea if that is possible in the bagged tea they do not put dust in the teabags because it would fall right out of the bag but since this is loose tea lipton saw fit to add dust twigs anything but the actual leaves br br what should you drink anything you like i suggest browsing this site called the english tea store no affiliation just to get an idea about what types of teas it is possible to purchase br br i astounds me that anyone could drink this substance and call it tea it is not tea it is particles of bitterness dust pieces of twigs black and tasteless leavings of what used to be a tea plant br br what the hell is wrong with you people to drink this stuff by the way i have nothing against some lipton tea but when you drink this stuff you need to add lemon sugar or cream something because it is awful stuff trying to drink it on its own br br if you have to buy tea at a supermarket try the twinings darjeeling that is a decent blend you can drink,foul tasting substance
10949,lipton does taste good but it is not a good quality tea if you open the tea bag you will see their not tea leaves but tea dust cheep even the loos lipton tea is described as being broken down so you need a fine filter to strain it when you steep good tea it should unfurl and look like spinach br br they say this tea comes to an oz lets do the math devided by oz br i buy my tea from set to a tea it is really good tea with flavoring and dried fruit pices it comes to an oz for a tin or for a refill weather you buy it loose or in bags you get the same quality tea i went to a tea party last year like a tupperware party but more fun where the chick told us all about the different kinds of tea and gave us samples,get better quality tea for less
10950,this tea was supposed to be loose tea i purchase loose tea all the time instead of packaging the tea in bags they left it loose gave a very couldy tea with a bitter taste,not real loose tea
10951,celestial seasonings is one of my favorites if not my favorite brands of tea fruit herbal teas are my favorite type i love this sampler box of herbal teas the five types of tea in order of my favorite flavors are country peach passion black cherry berry true blueberry raspberry zinger and wild berry zinger br br i love tea especially when eating certain foods but also i love it all by itself i love tea with most all kinds of foods especially cornbread or country foods it also goes good with most all other ethnic foods br br i usually drink my tea plain no sugar very very seldom do i add sugar and when i do it is a very small amount where i grew up sugar in tea is an option however i was stationed in the deep south and they drink thick sugar water with a drop of tea in it when my daughter was in elementary school her teacher had the audacity to bring me a glass of that thick sugar water i gagged i could not get past the first sip she might have gotten her feelings hurt they think you are crazy if you prefer tea with no sugar br br highly recommended if you like fruit herbal teas,herbal tea fruit flavors
10952,i love this tea served as chai latte served with milk and honey in fact i use evaporated milk instead of regular milk and it gives it a lovely creamy taste i am no expert on chai tea but then i go by what i like and i find this particular blend very pleasing i would recommend it to anyone who like spicy teas,lovely spicy chai tea
10953,so far this is the closest thing to the thai restaurant i have tried and though it is close it is still not exactly the same it does have that one spice that other thai teas are missing it is really outstanding,best thai tea so far
10954,these truffles melt slowly in your mouth with a wonderful flavor and smoothness and you want just one the most satisfying chocolate i have ever had i want some now,unbelievably delicious
10955,if you are looking for a way to get someone that thinks they can eat anything hot this is it i purchased kick your ass sauce which was rated sc put a bunch on a chip and eat it nothing no reaction the next day da bomb showed up at my door thinking that it is not much worse than the other i put a bunch on a chip wow pain no joke pain instantly the first thing in my mind was why did i do that this product is something that you can add to a soup or something but do not put anymore than a drop in your mouth at a time it is a neat experience to put a drop in your mouth serious pain for about minutes but any more rips your insides this even from a person that heats habaneros by themselves with his food br br if you are going to play a joke on someone just a drop is good the braveheart yesterday had to leave work and did not return to normal for about hours i told him only a drop his quoto is below when i told him what some other people reactions were when they took a drop br br tell them my insides are still on fuego i tried on occasions to puke it all up and nothing i was sitting on the can and decided i would better pull up my pants in case i passed out on the bathroom floor that way the person that found me would not have to see me with my pants around my ankles i took a piss and it felt like razor blades were coming out i hope you are happy br br trust me some fun stuff and the price is much better than the other stuff that pushes the limit,serious stuff
10956,india is weaponizing the ghost pepper true story and in my opinion the idea probably stemmed from the pain and submission that this sauce inflicts upon people be very careful with this stuff just one drop causes myself and all the other insane hot sauce fanatics i know to beg for mercy it will cause avid tough guy hot sauce lovers to go into retirement,hotter than hot
10957,i bought this hot sauce as my gift for a white elephant party i had watched several videos of people tasting it and watched them all writhe in pain and many go to the ground i knew that this stuff was potent and could potentially be used in nuclear weapons someone ended up picking it and brought it out to try i wanted no part of this while she was attempting to dole out her punishment some of it got on the kitchen table i went to wipe it up with a rag and accidentally got a small drop on my finger i instantly washed if off as i did not want any of its pain to somehow seep into my skin minutes later i found out the power that this beast holds i was talking to some people when all of a sudden it felt like someone had lit my junk on fire this was not a when you go raw dogg with some shady club chick type of burning this was more like pouring napal down my pants type of burning apparently water and soap are not enough to get a drop of this stuff off of your skin i did not know that i had to wear gloves to go take a leak after being in the presence of this hot suace safe to say for the next minutes i was in more pain than having to watch the notebook twice in a row,hotter than heidi klum and more powerful than a gorilla on acid
10958,title says it all i took a dollop of this on a cracker there is an odd mild and nondescript flavor that i doubt would taint anything then the burn begins to build it just continues to build up until ridiculous levels the mouth is the easy part anyone can conquer that and sit mildly while waiting for the minutes to go by its the other hours of intense gut pain that makes a man out of you you do not see that in the videos its worse if you eat it later after a previously eaten meal because it just sits in your stomach burning the hell out of you until all that food goes down the tubes sucked both times i did it used properly it puts a mean heat in anything you eat br br don t bother trying to be an hero and eating a spoonful you cannot handle it,perfect
10959,lets get this out of the way i regularly pop whole habanero peppers in my mouth and douse my food with dave ghost pepper insanity sauce that being said i was looking for the next taste bud hot challenge and figured i would give this a shot br br they do not lie when they say it is hot i put a single drop on a tortilla chip and although i was not in pain i was in moderate discomfort for about minutes i think the thing that got to me the most was that the taste was just not very good i am no culinary expert and i am sure it is extremely difficult to make something that hot taste good but compared to dave ghost pepper sauce it was bottom shelf in that department that being said i will be giving it another chance soon trying to incorporate it into a hot chili experiment br br bottom line if you are after a sauce to spice up a dish and leave it mostly edible for everyone but the diehard hot lovers i would recommend sticking with that sauce if you are reading these reviews though it is clear that you want hot and this sauce does not disappoint br br heat stars br overall product stars for taste br br scoville scale reference br habanero k br dave ghost pepper sauce k br da bomb hot sauce k,hot yes tasty no
10960,well yeah the sauce is awesome i had a lot of fun with it especially with friends who say it cant be that hot seariously everyone i know said its the hottest thing they ever had since im kinda used to it it has a great taste at all but pay attention dont drop it on your hands or your hands will start burning and its getting worse when you put them under water,spicy and a decent taste
10961,one drop of this stuff will make almost anyone cry for mercy it has million scoville units which measure heat in food fyi your average jalape ntilde o pepper has s u a habanero chili can have upwards of k s u a bhut jolokia ghost chili is the hottest known naturally occurring chili and that has around upwards of million s u the final answer is hotter than the hottest grown chili if you want something to break out at parties this is it i have yet to give it to someone who has not shown physical signs of pain even people who eat hot foods on a regular basis will still find this stuff extremely hot i have had lots of fun with the stuff and would recommend it to anyone,great stuff
10962,a drop at a time in a bowl or pot of chili will give you the heat level you want i will save a lot of money on peppers for my chili a little on a toothpick brought a fellow heat lover to tears,excellent hot sauce a good fruity taste and great heat
10963,i have tried many sauces from habanero to pod and trinidad scorpion to the ghost chilli and to those not too tasty extracts and this is the hottest one i have hard to believe the hottest pepper in this sauce is the habanero how can this be hotter than the ghost chilli and others i have because of the killer pepper extracts in there if you cannot even handle ground zero then do not even look at the final answer it is ground zero knocked up a million notches do not believe me try one drop one drop will leave you drooling and in a lot of pain it taste pretty bad it is only meant to taste hot and hurt you i do not suggest one drop straight on the tongue like i did put it in chilli or on cheese but if you gotten up the nerve to try it straight then props to you enjoy the pain br br worth the money this small bottle will last you years it is that hot and cool for any hotsauce collection,hottest sauce i own unbelievable
10964,yes the final answer is yes it is hot why even ask the question it is million svu if you are looking add a little heat this is not for you if you want to cry yourself to sleep wondering why why why then you are looking at the right product it is hot,mother lovin hot
10965,this review ended up a little long for those who want something quick if you have any taste buds remaining this will easily provide a satisfying burn at least when directly applied to your own food but also works very well when used as an additive br br the flavor starts a little smoky sweet and after seconds it begins to creep in with the heat br br that covers my quick verdict and how it satisfies the reasons i got it now here is what was going to be my original review and some personal accounts br br i had read about various hot sauces for several weeks to find something i could be sure would satisfy while well beyond the realm of a sauce with a rating of million scovilles about times hotter than an habanero and nearly twice that of the bhut jolokia is as others have said hot enough to give anything a satisfying burn with a few drops br br my applications so far include on a ritz bits sandwich on a brownie tacos hot chocolate and my sleeping brother br br for those of you that have thoughts of pranking others with something like this i would at least recommend great care in choosing victims woke my brother within seconds and had him chugging milk withing br br my personal favorite application is one drop on the ritz bits i nice strong burn for about half an hour and the small endorphin rush that follows is a good pickmeup but by no means recommended i am abit of an idiot at times and have been told in other scenarios that i have no taste buds br br lastly so far as i can figure one drop of this in fluid ounces of liquid will raise it about scovilles so i assumed drops in a cup of hot chocolate would give me about half a jalapeno well i could hardly taste the chocolate and my stomach threatened to chew it is way out alien style br br and i just reminded myself that i got some sauce on my finger nearly hours ago because after all that time and various hand washings my eye still burned after scratching it br br sorry if that is a little long but i wanted to add more input to this highly underrated product br br and very lastly if indeed the dropper releases microliters at a time the best description of the measurement of a drop i could find then there are well over a thousand drops in this bottle though i am not that great at math so you do not have to take my word for the numbers i give here br br happy eating br daniel,practical for hotheads
10966,let me preface this by saying that i dont even like hot sauce but after marrying a mexican woman and meeting friends who like spicy food i had to try a few things i first bought some of dave insanity sauces the ghost pepper and the hottest sauce in the universe and when i first tried them i did not think it would be possible to try anything worse then i found this bottle of terror let me tell you those sauces taste like kethcup compared to this i put about half the amount on those sauces than i did with this sauce and it was so hot after about minutes i ended up throwing up lol i would not recommend under any circumstances to try it straight out of the bottle i dont think there is a human being alive that could handle it but if you have a friend who thinks they can handle anything they will meet their match with this sauce i can guarantee that,try and and see for yourself
10967,let us be honest most of us buy this for the heat itself out of curiosity or stupidity br after trying blair ultra death i think it was at million scoville i can tell you that this is much hotter as advertised br million is not a joke so use one drop per serving br br i would give it a because of the lack of flavor and taste there is barely anything to enjoy or to look forward to when you use this hot sauce but that is expected i simply use it to make things hot not to enhance taste or for flavor and it never fails me br being that hot it can last you a long time worth the dollars,ever wanted to breath fire
10968,excellent product i use a drop on everything suprisingly this hot sauce actually tastes good i expected it to just be hot because it includes a pepper extract but it actually enhances the flavor food if you like hot,hot as hell
10969,warning this stuff is hot just adding a drop into some pho was too much but if u like and can handle spice then this is for u be warned thou enjoy,hot
10970,not for the faint hearted this is really really hot stuff i tasted drop on a toothpick and it burnt badly for minutes but it is all good,damn this is a hot sauce
10971,i started with tabasco sauce at age worked my way to jalapenos in my teens then habaneros and finally the ghost chili in my s i am always on the hunt for the next hottest sauce as i keep killing my taste buds on this stuff the last sauce i rolled the dice on was the dave ghost pepper sauce and it was fantastic i thought ghost peppers would be the hottest thing until i got my hands on this little tiny bottle called da bomb the final answer hmmmm made from habaneros and pepper extract it could not be too bad i thought like a champ i put a dime sized blob on a chip and tossed it in my mouth after a few chews my parents asked me well how is it i tried to talk and realized once this bad boy goes aerosol or you breathe it you are done it is goo cough cough my eyes began to water and the heat took over this stuff is not a joke not a game over the past year my mouth and tongue has become desensitized to it and i can eat it no problem but the intestines never lie it feels like the devil himself is laughing while he crawls through your colon clawing you from within do not attempt to eat this on an empty stomach in a pathetic attempt to show off to co workers i brought it to work and we all tried some before lunch after a few minutes i felt as if a fiery ulcer had erupted and had to chug about sodas before it subsided this is the hottest stuff i have found to date yet i am still on the hunt use at your own misguided risk,definitely the final answer for now
10972,i am extremely happy with this product i used it to add a little fire to my salsa and was not disappointed be careful if you get any of the undiluted extract on your skin as it does not easily wash off the oils are persistent and if you rub your eyes etc you will likely feel the burn if you want a brutally hot sauce this is the one to use,the final answer indeed
10973,the ingredients are habanero peppers hot pepper extract apricot nectar mustard flour garlic and allspice i wrote a review after trying da bomb the first time but now that i have had it for a few days i have to revise my statement i really like this stuff but it is intense i started small and thought i was a hot sauce champ so i got cocky and put idk how much on a bbq sandwich i got dizzy and confused and was like uh oh lucky my wife was not there to see it because she is always lecturing me about spicy food around hours later i was pissing razors i will continue to eat it though as much as i can stand anyway,the other reviews are right
10974,this sauce is most definitely hot not intolerable but definitely hot the hottest i own and i have sauces made from the ghost pepper i put a drop about the diameter of a pea on a tortilla chip immediately you have the flavor which is not too bad to be honest kind of a dark smoky pepper fruit flavor then the heat shows up and keeps building from a tinge until your mouth feels like its glowing maybe its because i was not an idiot who took a spoonful of the stuff but there was no minute burn the real burn lasted maybe minutes the gut bomb that everyone talks about nonexistent and i am not one of these people who claim to eat habaneros plain on their own because i don t personally i have to call bs on the people that say that its a bit expensive for a oz bottle but when all it takes to give something a pleasant heat is a drop or two without changing flavor its worth the price this sauce will last you for a while br br final thought dont be a hero and try to take a whole spoonful of this not only is it too expensive to use it like that but take that much and you will regret it,da bomb the final answer yes
10975,this is the hottest sauce i have ever had just drop in a soup makes my mouth burn for minutes and i start crying this sauce is not for the faint of heart,hottest sauce ever
10976,like most other sauces in this heat range this sauce adds heat to a dish without significantly affecting the flavor when you want to control the flavor of a dish with its other ingredients and just add pure heat this is ideal the bottle has a dropper attached to the lid so it is easy to meter out just the right amount although the price seems a bit high for such a small bottle it really is a good deal since it only takes a small amount to add a lot of heat,excellent food additive
10977,adds flavor and heat to food hot but not intolerable for those who can handle spicy foods purchased as a gift and would buy again,heat with flavor
10978,this is one hot extract i use drop in a bowl of soup and it makes it plenty hot i also use it to heat up my chili if you like it hot but not so over the top you cannot taste the food then this is the final answer you have been looking for,the final answer oh yeah
10979,aside from the obvious benefits of using this product to spice up your food it also works wonders with multiple other regular household problems rusted bolts do not stand a chance against the metal disintegrating power of this product it works better and faster then wd it also does wonders for pest control as i had a few ants constantly in my garage so i put this stuff in a dish with some syrup in the middle all the ants died crossing this sauce i also successfully removed a small grease stain from my garage floor which is not as practical as it is possible because you have to use a majority of the hot sauce br br the sauce itself is unbelievably hot i am talking pain inducing i am too sick to move spicey i put a squirt on a chip and thought my nose started bleeding i would recommend you only use this product in large batches of food large pot of chili if you want to experience about as much pain as possible without any long term effects at least i hope not take a swig of this stuff i would also recommend a comfortable toilet seat and possibly a magazine subscription and some kleenex if you start crying amazon really knows what to sell if they are trying to increase product sales in other departments,very handy
10980,i really liked this hot sauce it is incredibly hot it is perfect for pranking friends with if you are looking for something like that my only complaint is that it is a bit hard when cooking with it to find a good balance of the hot and flavor other than that the heat and flavor are both there and are almost perfect,insanely hot
10981,this stuff is pretty dang hot it does not have the best flavor but that is understandable for sauce that comes with a dropper best used for spicing up a pot of beans and rice or chili so if you want to try this stuff on a chip or something you better have a half hour or so to deal with the burn its intense,hot stuff
10982,the bottle is tiny but it will go a long way all you need is a tiny drop on a toothpick to spice up your plate,final answer
10983,this is just one for the shelf it looks pretty interesting if you hold a flashlight to it but the fact it is not an actual extract and has other ingredients habanero being the first is why i put this one off for years before finally ordering the source from original juan same company that produces this million scovilles is a much better purchase buy two one bottle of the source will last a life better yet grab a ml vial of million scoville capsaicin crystal from,for the collection
10984,i bought this sauce with very high expectations for heat i was disappointed i know something is wrong this is supposed to be very very spicy but when i tried it it was not too bad at all i got a bad batch or something the taste is pretty bad it is really earthy dirt flavor but i was not expecting good taste just heat which did not deliver very well i kept this at a high rating because it is really spicy but i just got a bad batch,da bomb the final answer
10985,i love the litter dropper in the lid to add just the right number of drops it is spicy but not too bad for some fun try adding drops in your next batch of brownies it is actually really good,excellent for spicing up dishes
10986,the dark chocolates were great and the packaging was great for christmas br the tin was something you dont see in america anymore br perfect to reuse for candy or other things at christmas,great gift ideas at christmas
10987,my mother in law loves this product i looked at several sites and could not find it without havig to in some cases pay over and was so happy to find this on amazon,wonderful at amazon
10988,there are only a few candies in this tiny box not worth spending over,nice but too expensive for such a small size
10989,a friend introduced me to lavazza a few years ago and i have to say it is one of the nicest coffees i have had i use it in my stove top espresso maker and it brews a perfect cup every time i also use the decaf version which is also really good for decaf my only gripe would be that it is neither fair trade or organic,great coffee
10990,this espresso coffee is an excellent coffee it has a wonderful head on it and a great flavor i only wish it were a little stronger it is a mellow espresso flavor and i prefer bold rich flavors to my espresso coffee my wife who likes a milder coffee thinks that this is the best espresso she has ever had,very good espresso
10991,just used this product in my delonghi ec best cup of espresso i have gotten from it so far possibly best cup ever,best espresso ever
10992,my daughter living and working in dc this summer introduced me to this product while home for a visit she encouraged me to give the plain version just pure coconut water a chance first and by the second container i understood the amazing qualities of this drink i felt so refreshed hydrated and healthy i later tried the kind with pineapple which is also delicious but i think the plain is more effective and purely refreshing when really hot tired and thirsty while the sweeter fruit infused version will be amazing as part of a cocktail cannot wait for,ambrosia
10993,this has been my favorite brand of coconut water of the ones i have tried they use real fruit juice for flavoring as well as it tastes good br br we tried the smaller size and they just are not large enough to get enough water at the gym and are not resealable br br things i like about this br br perfect size for an hour long gym routine br resealable cap smaller one lacks this br tasty like a pina colada br br negative br br box makes it hard to get the last drops usually end up squishing it up to get the last bit br br so great coconut water perfect size and cheaper than buying locally at sprouts with the amazon subscribe and save,great coconut water in just the right size
10994,i like the slight pineapple flavor in this better than the plain coconut water good well chilled coconut water is supposed to be a healthy drink,good taste
10995,love this juice scheduled shipment is convenient and economical this is a very expensive beverage and any way to save some money on it is worth it,a great product and convenient shipment
10996,i have tried every brand of coconut water that health food stores carry and this is by far my favorite the pineapple flavor does not overwhelm the coconut or vice versa i also like the tetra pack with the screw on top it is much more convenient than the smaller oz size which you cannot reseal this has been a great gatorade substitute for me and helps a lot when i am sick or dehydrated or need to hydrate quickly great stuff,best tasting coconut water i have found
10997,shipping great and loved product the boxes are a little tough because there is not a lid if you do not finish i suggest buy only little ones this way,like it
10998,i discovered vita coco a few months ago of the flavors i have tried i like the pineapple best it tastes like a mild pina colada without the alcohol i love the idea of an all natural hydrating drink that is low in sugar and high in potassium whenever i am hot thirsty or a little run down i find that vita coco coconut water with pineapple really quenches my thirst refreshes me and gives me a little energy boost without added sugar or any artificial ingredients like the ones in gatorade and other drinks aimed at balancing electrolytes an ounce serving has only calories and mg of sodium less than fat free milk with mg of potassium and of the rda of vitamin c it is a little pricey but if you can buy it on sale with free shipping it is a great value although i have previously purchased it on amazon i more recently bought it at gnc during gold card week when there was a free shipping offer and a buy get free offer with a deal like that it breaks down to less than cents per oz serving,hydrating refreshing great tasting drink
10999,pineapple is hands down my favorite flavor of vita coco it not only serves a great electrolyte replenishing beverage aka the perfect hangover cure but it can also be made into a pinacolada if you just add some rum,my favorite flavor
11000,i really like this coconut water but i was surprised that per oz box it is the same price at wegman probably will not be ordering again unless there is some sort of discount,just as advertised
11001,heard about this drink from a friend and had to try it had one while traveling and loved it i sat on the plane enjoying it i was thinking i should bought another one,awesome tasting
11002,i subscribe to this monthly but just got an email stating that it is changing from oz to oz but no price change wow that is a really lame cut to increase their profit margins whatever i will not miss the oz obviously but how about messaging and acknowledging your devoted consumers,um package change from oz to oz
11003,i tasted the pineapple flavor yesterday at a friend cocktail party she used it to mix with rum to make pina coladas it complimented the drink so well the bottles are really pretty to set up and hand out at a party as well br br i have been drinking vita coco for a while now and usually drink the pure but i find the flavors to be such a treat yet still very healthy especially after a long workout,vita coco
11004,it is high quality and the price is right especially with subscribe and save via prime but after months of trying to keep up with my subscription i had to put it on hold i am not a big water drinker but this stuff has a distinct flavor and when you are using it as a work out beverage four or five times a weak it eventually wears on you or me at least i would still recommend it just do not od the way i did,i was addicted to this stuff for a while but wore myself out
11005,originally i was turned of by this product when i tasted the regular flavor once i had the version with pineapples i was instantly hooked i used to get a lot of stomach cramps and cramps in my feet since i have incorporated this drink daily it has aided my digestive system and obliterated all of my previous cramp problems i would recommend vita coco to all of my friends and family,the answer to all your cramping problems
11006,of all the flavors vita coco produces the pineapple combination is by far the best it has just enough flavor to keep it interesting but not overpowering,vita coco with pineapple the best yet
11007,the pineapple coconut combination is refreshing i especially like that there is no added sugar this is a welcomed change from other brands,vita coco
11008,i like this product so much i have it delivered monthly so happy to be drinking this at work while my co workers are stuck with pop it is so refreshing and revitalizing the only coconut water flavor i like is pineapple transports easily and stores easily with the screw on top,refreshing and delicious
11009,i always feel refreshed when i drink this coconut water the pineapple gives it an added extra that makes it truly irresistible it has been a firm favorite of mine now for nearly a year,my favorite
11010,i tried quite a few varieties of this brand and the pineapple is the best light but refreshing i am not sure if i think it is a miracle elixer or anything but i did purchase a case and look forward to drinking this on a regular basis thank you for the great value and convenience amazon,best flavor light but refreshing
11011,i use vita coco coconut water with pineapple to mix with my ultra meal nutritional supplement it mixes well and taste great i have it for breakfast every morning,cold and refreshing
11012,this product does not have the greatest taste i like jamba coconut water but it is hard product to find i purchased this to try out and i am not liking it but it is tolerable when it is cold really cold reason why i gave it two stars i tried the coconut water when it was warm to see if it really tastes bad like some of the reviews said and sure enough they were right,not the greatest
11013,if you have not had coconut water with pineapple juice before then you need to try this simply delicious and so healthy for you,yummy
11014,bigger is always better and that is not what she said i did i got turned on to coconut water about a year ago and since then have not been able to get enough of it i found that vita coco is the best brand around the pineapple flavor has a great sweetness that compliments the coconut water to create a refreshing thirst quenching beverage i have recently began to drink more due to the nature of my job so i do not cramp up in my hands plus with all the nutrients and benefits whats there not too like with subscribe and save i can quench my thirst any time of year thanks vita coco you surely have a lovely bunch of coconuts,same great taste just more of it
11015,i love the taste of the viva coco with pineapple if i was likening it to a common drink it is a melted virgin pina colada br the oz boxes are better for me than the other sizes because they contain the resealable lids in case you do not drink it all at once br as with all coconut waters the taste can vary slightly but the pineapple seems to keep it pretty consistant,best coconut water flavor and size
11016,good thirst quencher milky and thicker then i expected not what i would call a pineapple flavor but one can get the idea it is pineapple,unusual flavor
11017,i love the pineapple coconut water it is high in potassium i am a rural mail carrier and have to be out in the hot weather in the afternoon i get hot dry and thirsty i am trying to lose weight so i am watching my calories water is wet and cold but does not quench my thirst this stuff does the trick it quenches my thirst and gives me a little pick up for the afternoon and keeps me going this only has calories per serving so that is much less than a calorie gatorade i recommend this to those looking for a healthy alternative to the sugary sports drinks,my afternoon pick up
11018,i love the pineapple the best had a hard time finding this at the store they get ya hooked and then stop carring it i have tried the other brands of coconut water but i am just not loving them so i went online hoping to find this brand and there it was now mom happy and so is everyone else love the vita coco,thirst quenching
11019,short and brief the product has a wonderful coconut taste and the pineapple addition is light and mildly sweet i will certainly purchase this again,coconut water with pineapple yummy
11020,i have always wanted to like coconut water low in calories high in minerals but i have just never liked the taste much the pineapple juice in this really makes a difference it still needs to be well chilled to be good but it makes a healthy post workout drink,finally a coconut water i like
11021,i love buying these and drinking them after my workout you lose not just fluids but minerals vitamins and this helps replenish you water is good too for you too but i just love these post workout they are also good for anytime when you could use a sweet but natural drink like you do not want milk or soda or water but want something tasty and refreshing,delicious
11022,after reading about the benefits of coconut water i decided to give this brand a try i have tried a few other brands with a juice added but they all have lot of extra sodium be sure to read the labels some have less potassium in them than the via coco brand i felt like this was better for my husband to drink than gatorade he works on a c during the summer and is out in the heat all day long,coconut water
11023,love the pineapple flavor makes me feel like i am on vacation drinking a pina colada you probably could add a little rum and really tastes better than other pineapple coconut waters i have tried,yummy
11024,this product is a good addition to fruit smoothies it thins it out while adding good taste and electrolytes which are good during the very hot weather,good for use in smoothies
11025,i love this water i started buying it after my bikram yoga classes to rehydrate and now drink it whenever i feel a little dehydrated living in az i tend to not drink enough water so these help tremendously and are delicious too try them you will be hooked,awesome
11026,vita coco water is taste great by itself or mixed up in a smoothie it is great for re hydration after a workout and has more potassium than a banana,vita coco water is awsome
11027,it says on the box each drink contains the potasium of bananas more electrolites than a sports drink they might seem a little high priced but go to groecery store buy bananas sports drinks and you will pay more to get the same nutrition you get from juice box of this coconut water,excellent
11028,great before during and after a workout great natural electrolytes very high in potassium amazing drink this is my favorite flavor tangerine is nd,delicious and rejuvenating
11029,great real coconut young coconut taste not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks good on the environment made in brazil even better you can really taste the fruit labelled on the product besides the coconut water taste,great taste nice fruit flavor serve chilled
11030,not only does vita coco have the best taste much better than one br and slightly better than zito but now they have the best package br also br br this new screw top is great to take to the gym hiking and biking br br coc water is the best re hyrator and imo vita coco is the best br i also noticed when i searched coconut water on amazon com that br vita coco comes up number one so others seem to think that vita br coco is number one also because they are voting with thier purchases,vita coco is best
11031,according to an article on cnn com on the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the lable br researchers at consumerlab com tested the sodium potassium magnesium and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water and they found that only one zico natural contained the stated amount for all four ingredients br br the sugar and potassium content in the other two brands vita coco and o n e also matched the label but the amounts of sodium and magnesium two nutrients key to hydration were as much as and lower respectively than the listed amount,nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the label
11032,i bought this at a local gas station near my house and was excited to try it because i see it everywhere it was nasty i will never drink this crap again i do not care how good it is for you the taste is disgusting and i would rather just drink regular water blah,gross
11033,i am so addicted to these you know the movie when harry met sally when i drink one of these it just feels like that famous scene in the movie orgasmic,so addicted
11034,this stuff is pretty disgusting i do not care if madonna tom cruise or whatever celebrity invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo opps it tastes bad and as far as rehydrating better than water umm do not think so it might replenish potassium although unless you are participating in the olympics you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity,well
11035,i had hoped that this would taste like pina coladas but it doesn t it is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue i wanted something to drink after a work out or to give to my kids when we are traveling but it is to hard for me to swallow the reason i gave it stars is because it is good in mixed drinks i have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol if you are going to drink this straight it helps if it is really cold almost frozen if you really like the taste of coconut milk you might like this because that is the only thing i can taste in it,yuck
11036,my year old horse little joe loves these and they are helping him i wish they come in bigger bags,these are great
11037,i am leasing a year old mare who is extremely stiff and quite out of shape i started her on these weeks ago and have noticed a big improvement with her movement i do not know if it is mainly because she is getting into shape or if the glucosamine is helping she loves them so i plan on continuing to give these to her for the remainder of the lease and to my next horse if he she is in the older category it can only be good for them,hip joint w glucosamine
11038,i got this for my year old gelding he loves it and it seems to be helping him his appetite and joints appear to be improving i wish they sold this in lb or lb sizes then all of our horses could have this everyday,great treat with benefits
11039,i purchased this for christmas i love peppermint bark and like to try a new kind every year its a very special yearly treat for me so i expect a lot from the product br br pros for scott cakes version good organization and logistics the package arrived quickly the candy was well wrapped in the shipping box and shrink wrapped in a box of its own candy was in good condition i e no broken pieces and fresh br br this seller peppermint bark achieves a nice mix of peppermint and white chocolate flavor white chocolate gives off a nice mellow tone it is good quality there is no dark chocolate layer to upset the balance of peppermint and white chocolate flavors in one mouth this attracted me to scott cakes br br cons the quality of the peppermint pieces in the chocolate was very disappointing the ad mentions that the buyer should expect to see pieces of candy cane peppermint starlight mints mixed with white chocolate the photo seems to support this claim showing robustly sized pieces of candy cane in the bark i expected a very crunchy chewing experience which i think is the hallmark of the best types of peppermint bark however the pieces of peppermint candy are in reality very small there is no sensation of crispness when taking a bite the peppermint candy has a chewy consistency making it seem more like taffy thus there is no auditory pleasure in consuming this version of peppermint bark,christmas treat
11040,i was first reading reviews the starbucks website for this coffee and it had great reviews so i though i might give it a try i went to downtown and bought a bag of whole bean caffe verona and boy i am glad i made that decision br br out of the bag the rich dark brown colors and the aroma punished me of the years i lived without this a blend of yukon blend an array of latin american and indonesian coffees and italian roast a blend of latin american coffees br br in the cup the flavor was weak bold as it smelled it did not seem to have the same score in taste light bodyweight with a woody feel to it the light acidity is topped off with a fruity overtone and bittersweetness br br let me be as bold as to recommend peet arabian mocha java if you are looking for a multiblend similar to this peet fixes whatever lacked in starbuck verona this mocha java is balanced nutty and smooth it has excellent acidity with a slight bite br br if you want a closer mix to this than i would mix the arabian mocha java with sumatra and you will be very satisfied with its resemblance br br there are many coffee drinkers who hate starbucks because of their corporate culture and popularity i just like to try anything which looks interesting to me and this caffe verona is one of the better speciality blends starbucks has offered br br i almost forgot to mention whole beans always rule even if you ground your beans at your nearest cafe or supermarket the moment the ground coffee comes in contact with the air the aroma starts to leak grind your beans moments before you put it to use you will see notice the change in taste and aroma when you are drinking it,very interesting blend
11041,first of all in response to the query of why you would order this online posed by the reviewer below not everyone lives near a starbucks hard to believe i know considering they seem to be on every street corner but believe it or not there are still large sections of the us w out starbucks so for those of us who want good coffee thank god for the internet amazon verona is my favorite sb blend it does not taste burnt as some of their coffee does to me it has a boldness without being too dark overwhelming and it has subtle notes of chocolate without the icky sweetness of a flavored coffee it makes a delicious cup of coffee,my favorite starbucks variety
11042,this is my favorite starbucks roast but why dont you just go to your local starbucks to purchase this its the same price if you just go there and you dont have to pay for shipping and handeling and all that stuff plus they will grind it for you there,good coffee but
11043,as a perusal of comment about verona dark will show the fans of regular verona are terribly disappointed that their favorite coffee is being discontinued it is your company and you can run it any way you please conclusion unless there is a specific reason to discontinue regular verona the decision to do so is for me terribly ill advised br br there how is that for potentially positive and useful feedback br br ps i cannot choose the product you want me to specify because you mention only dark verona,bring back verona
11044,i love this coffee i drink it black i drink it days a week a few cups a day in the morning it is bold and strong and i would not want it any other way it is delicious it may not be for everyone but i give it stars,starbucks french roast
11045,if you like a strong but smooth flavorful coffee this is it i have tried others and just keep coming back to this one my second joice would be the starbucks italian blend,best coffee i have tasted i try others but always come back
11046,the folks at starbucks are not exaggerating when they say their french roast coffee is extra bold in fact they should probably call it extremely bold or maybe even ridiculously bold the directions on the package recommend tablespoons of coffee for every ounces of filtered water the result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it but it does not taste too bad that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn if you weaken it by adding some hot water as the package suggests the bitter taste becomes more pronounced like coffee that is been left heating in the pot too long the only way to drink this coffee is with plenty of cream and sugar with enough cream and sugar french roast is pretty good but i would not recommend this particular starbucks variety if you like your coffee black unless you wanna stay awake for a week,well if this does not wake you up nothing will
11047,i sent this coffee to two friends back east they thoroughly enjoyed getting it and said it was delicious,gifts of coffee
11048,the product i received came in a different package than what is pictured but that is fine because it was a little bigger than what i expected the oil doesnt really have a smell so that is good because i intend to use it in a mixture of oils for my natural hair the delivery was fast and even arrived a day prior to the scheduled delivery date i have only used it once so far and mixed it with olive oil as a hot oil treatment it was not greasy at all and left my hair nice and soft i gave it stars because i have not had time to use it enough i will update this review after i have used it for awhile and can make a better assessment,different packaging but that is okay
11049,i would not recommend this oil it does not have a pleasant smell and does not purify the skin it is just like other oils i have bought from drug stores which were cheaper,not so good
11050,do not order this it has absolutely no taste and was completely disappointing i tried to return the unopened boxes and amazon would not let me total bummer and waste of money,tasteless
11051,these inexpensive little rewards for dogs seem to be a good quality and very palatable br br i ve had problems pleasing my dogs as far as tasty treats some snacks are just completely ignored br br i ve had no problem with my dog accepting these snacks and actually they consume it eagerly and quick so it passes the taste test br br sergean t is an established and trusted name in pet care products and this is a fine product your dog will probably love,dogs love them
11052,my month old female lab shep hound mix loves these she likes to fling them around like a cat and they keep her busy for a good ten minutes they are also a bit chewier than other treats so she takes her time finishing them and considers them an ultimate reward when she does something good they can be hard to find in stores but are readily available on amazon,best treat to keep a dog busy
11053,for those of you that have never tried spiedies which is most anyone that is not from the endicott ny area you should do yourself a favor and use salamida spiedie marinade cut up some chicken into chunks marinade for hours and bbq on skewers serve on italian bread or rolls yum so nice to be able to get this sauce shipped to the house in california,yum
11054,i love this stuff it is not your regular milk chocolate hot cocoa but if you like trying different flavors of cocoa you should give this a try to me it tastes like dark chocolate and is not as sweet as the regular stuff but it has a great taste and it is actually good for you highly recomend it,super good
11055,i put this product in my coffee it tastes fantastic coffee is kindof boring without it excellent product super good for you,gano schokolade
11056,i was so frustrated they hooked me on this product at the local walmart and then stopped carrying it i could not find it at any of the local stores so i went to amazon and there it was i have enough to last for a good while now and it was exactly as advertised and arrived in good time,go to amazon when you cannot find in locally
11057,a href http www amazon com gp product b fsk i calorie packs honey maid delight bars cheesecake count bars pack of a br br these low cal cheesecake flavored bars taste decadent without adding inches to your waist line they actually do taste like a cheesecake bar should taste which is refreshing many of the low cal foods do not live up to their description when you purchase something and it says cheesecake you should get the taste that your are expecting which is cheesecake not chemical not overwhelmingly sweet but just right i found these cheesecake delight bars to be exactly as described the taste of cheesecake was there and the bar more then adequately fulfills my craving for sweets minus that overwhelming unnatural sweet taste that is present in many low cal bars if you are a fan of cheesecake but not the very high calorie count associated with cheesecake which i have been told by those in the know is one of if not the cake that has the highest caloric count then this is for you these bars will definitely be part of my shopping list in the future,excellent low cal treat
11058,absolutely love this product it is a nice treat for those who are looking for low calorie sweet snack the name is perfect and says it all delight bars,this product is delicious
11059,i guess i am in the minority but i really did not like these much i was so excited for a cheesecake flavor when i saw it but these were disappointing the bars are super sickly sweet with a weird chemically fake vanilla ish undertaste absolutely no cheesecake or cream cheese type flavor and even the graham layer is just sweet without any real graham cracker taste the overall texture is slightly gritty and gummy not at all creamy sizewise they are smallish but pretty standard for any of the many calorie ish snack pack foods similar in price as most granola and snack bars none of which are ever much of a good value overall while they are not inedible or anything i would not buy these again and i do not even think i will bother with the rest of the box,overly sweet flavorless
11060,found these at walmart and instantly loved these cookies the taste is so good and it is a great example of a healthy choice to make without leaving out anything on the taste too bad these bars are not widely available anymore luckily amazon helps me out every time and delivers some boxes to my doorstep when my personal stock runs out would not know what to have without these it is without a doubt the best flavor in the series,best treats ever
11061,this is the perfect snack for that am drop between breakfast and lunch it is creamy without being too sweet i am so glad amazon offers this bar since all the grocery stores in my area have discontinued them give them a try,my am daily snack
11062,first had these in la no grocery store in my area sells them odd because providence ri is not a remote town anyway i was glad to find them on amazon,sweet treats
11063,hi br does anyone know what the nutritional info is on these specifically sugar content per bar carbs br br thanks,i am looking for nutritional information on these please
11064,my cat is years old and very finicky about what she eats she has never eaten dry food she will starve before touching dry food but mostly she just meows as loud as she can and gets into mischief if she does not have what she wants to eat she loves this type of cat food though i do not know whether it is the cheese she likes or the over all taste but she devours it every time i wish it was smooth instead of strips as she seems to have trouble chewing it i wish the grocery stores would stock more of it as i usually buy for a month at a time,great
11065,this is a new line for friskies and is not a treat as the title implies just another can of cat food to try my female loves this stuff cannot wait to get it in her dish and gets quite angry whenever she gets anything else but this or the tuna variety my male forget it he loves the shredded turkey and cheese but will not go near this one weirdest thing in the world to me thought he would go gaga over it like he does his turkey but he just will not touch this stuff anyway this is a bit pricey here so check around for a better price at least in ohio it is a bit high highly recommend,loved by one hated by the other
11066,this may seem like a treat to my cats but it really is food my two youngest cats prefer tasty treasures over all the friskies flavors they sit and and eat until every last bit is gone i have never had a cat do that with any cat food i have been waiting for amazon to carry all the flavors at a reasonable price so i can stop hauling them from my local petstore i highly recommend this especially if you have a picky eater,not treats cat food
11067,i purchased these chips for my mobile vending cart because i have amazon prime the cost per bag is really good as far as a reseller goes each flavor is really good in its own right these chips the asian sweet and spicy are just so tasty its just the right amount of sweet and the slightest bit of spice that makes these a fantastic tasting chip br br lets talk about details br br chip thickness br these are gourmet chips and the quality is there from the moment you open the bag each one is crunchy and not too thick but just enough to let you know you did not buy a bag of lays br br grease br these are not greasy chips depending on the flavor they are just mildy seasoned and not coated in a heavy grease or oil br br flavor br each flavor stands completely on its own you could do a blind taste test of each one of these flavors sold by deep river and i bet you could tell what it was none of the flavors are overpowering except maybe the jalapeno flavor which is honestly too hot and i love hot food br br resale br you may not resell these but at the current price and using prime shipping the cost per bag allows you to make a decent profit br br overall br these are great tasting unique flavored chips that are hands down better than the ones you can get in bulk at a sams or bj do yourself a favor and try a bag or two i bet you will love em like we do br br thanks for reading my review,fantastic gourmet chip this flavor is one of the best
11068,they are delicious not salty you can sit and eat ounce bags at a time i give these stars plus i have to stop myself from eating them they are delicious,deep river potato chips
11069,i like these chips even though they are a little different than chips i am used to i love that they are reduced fat but be warned they are extremely crunchy so crunchy that i have to turn the volume up on the tv to hear it when i am chewing them the taste is quite good though and i like crunchy salty food i will probably order them again,good chips
11070,these chips are the best i have tried some of the other flavors and they are ok nothing special but the mesquite bbq is hands down the best bbq chips i have ever had if you like bbq chips and are not concerned with the calories most chips bring then you will not be disappointed in these,mesquite bbq
11071,addictive and totally unexpected i first tasted these at the fancy food show in new york a couple of years ago was amazed to find them on amazon and bought immediately for our lunch clients what you want in a potato chip the crunch is fantastic and the flavor gives off both rosemary and olive oil ending in a surprisingly smoky note,superior chips wow
11072,i took a chance on these and they are awesome they are crisp and not at all greasy i like the lay kettle chips but these are really much better less greasy maybe a bit more crisp too the rosemary is good it is not overpowering and it tastes like rosemary no msg hits the salty snack craving just right i like the size too it is enough to satisfy a craving but keeps me from eating a whole big bag which i would probably do with these if that is what i had i will definitely order them again my husband and year old both really like them too,love these
11073,these are delicious lower sodium fat chips convenient lunch snack size bag is enough for sharing halloween is two months away and the kids will be getting these for trick or treating at our house by the case means they are always on hand,do not have to eat just one
11074,the chips are deliciously spicy and super crispy it takes a second for the heat to hit but br when it does it is awesome love these chips and will continue to buy for a long time,spicy hot chips
11075,just to keep it simple more of a comparison than a total review i love jalapeno chips look mostly for the level of spice then pepper flavor good crunch and not loaded down with salt br br with that said these deep river snacks chips jalapeno flavor are br better than the lays jalapeno deep river have the same spice level which is lacking neither have a lot of pepper flavor br about the same as the jalapeno chips that the world market branded chips world market has a little more spice but also a lot more salt br not nearly as good as tim cascade jalapeno chips tims has more pepper flavor more spice a little bit better crunch but also have msg br br it not to say these chips are bad but just what the stars says it is ok there are better there are worse to me these are right in the middle of the pack,keep it simple
11076,deep river snacks are the best chips ever i am addicted to the zesty jalapeno and have not tried other flavors i recommend this brand to everyone,yummy
11077,these are everything i want in a potato chip flavor that jumps out at you and they stay crunchy br do yourself a favor and flavor and try these chips,flavor and crunch
11078,whole family loved em hard enough to break your teeth in a good way they are kettle chips after all for we will definitely buy again,great flavor
11079,these are very good chips the asian sweet spicy not too sweet not too spicy or salty perfectly balanced seasoning we received very fresh packages i just like thicker cut potato chips especially being kettle cooked but that will not deter me from ordering again,great tasting just wish they were thicker cut
11080,i really like these chips and so do my customers tangy and spicy chips with a sweet finish i look for oz bags like these,great taste great price
11081,my husband was just diagnosed as gluten intolerant and he thought his life was over surprize he loved these chips and could not believe it i did too and am not allergic to foods cannot say enough good things about this chip,great tasting
11082,i find deep river snacks everywhere but hardly ever find the cracked pepper and sea salt glad that amazon carries it if you like spicy and peppery these are the chips for you,hard to find item
11083,deep river salt vinegar chips are thick and crunchy very tart so tart that i cannot eat them alone they are perfect with a sandwich though these chips are well coated with the seasonings maybe too much seasonings for some folks tastes i suggest buying a small bag before purchasing a large quantity of these they are not for everyone enjoy,crispy and tart
11084,i was very skeptical about buying a brand of chips i had never tasted before much less buying it in bulk br however i had not regretted it br these chips are one of the best i had tried and certainly exceeded my expectations br they re reasonably priced too so that is a big plus,exceeded my expectations one of the best chips i have had
11085,before you turn to other name brands out there give these a try although the maui onion can be a bit salty at times i can still say these are amongst the crunchiest and tastiest chips i have ever had now i have tried both the barbeque and asian style flavor but still i must say these are the best if you are looking for something to snack on that tastes good these are the ones for you its better than the pringle commercial since these are harder to put down once you start,awesome goodness deep river kettle chips swt maui onion pack of
11086,i was expecting some serious flavor as it was advertised on the bag but compared to other jalapeno chips i have had it is pretty bland the ingredients list is short which is a plus and it is fairly low in sodium mg per oz serving which is probably why i prefer this less as i like saltier chips overall i would say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip but if you like strong flavor like i do stick with kettle brand jalapeno chips,pretty good but prefer other jalapeno chips
11087,i purchased the salt and vinegar chips and have been very pleased there is the right amount of vinegar virtually every single chip i have tasted is done just right no burned chips and they have an excellent thickness to impart just the correct amount of potato taste br br they go great with lunches or as a snack they are very economical beats the heck in terms of quality taste and price to buying these at work or out and about i bought the ounce bags i will be trying some of the other intriguing flavors recommended,excellent chips full of flavor and just the right thickness and doneness
11088,this is a heavy kettle style chip that is not as heavy as kettle brand chips but bas good flavor i will reorder,good chips
11089,i recently bought these chips came home and only three bags were left in the box my whole family loves them they have great flavor and better and healthier than more chips i am ordering a few more boxes today,great chips
11090,these are not the same old chips by far and the asian sweet spicy sparked my imagination too makes you appreciate the new and improved variety of potatoe chips this flavor is easily an on the ten scale,very good taste twist chips
11091,i love rosemary chips but cannot find any at my location i was glad i came across these at such a great price,chips
11092,the potato chips are wonderfully tasty my sons and i both like the rosemary and olive oil because it is not as spicy we also got the jalapeno it is not so much i do not like the jalapeno it is spicy hot for me i still love the potato chips,great tasting potato chips
11093,being what you would call a chip connoisseur was looking forward to trying these great chips,best jalapeno chips
11094,very nice chips just the right size to serve with a sandwich and watch my calories,just the right size package great chips
11095,my order was carried out in a fast and effective manner i received my shipment of chips within two days and had no problems with the retailer br br the chips sweet onion variety are flavorful and particularly crunchy the only negative a subjective one is that the chips may be too salty other than that i would recommend buying these chips again,flavorful but salty
11096,this is a re post of the review i left for the oz bags addictive and totally unexpected i first tasted these at the fancy food show in new york a couple of years ago was amazed to find them on amazon and bought immediately for our lunch clients what you want in a potato chip the crunch is fantastic and the flavor gives off both rosemary and olive oil ending in a surprisingly smoky note,superior chips wow
11097,ingredients on deep river snacks website are potatoes sunflower oil and or corn oil whey sea salt onion powder sugar garlic powder torula yeast dried parsley maltodextrix canola oil soybean oil rosemary extract and natural flavors br br false adversing much,according to the manufacturer own website these have no olive oil
11098,these chips are very spicy to say the least my tongue burned too much to finish the small individual serving bag they have an overpowering amount of some asian spice perhaps ginger but it is way too strong and you are left with a very unpleasant taste i bought of the small size bags but could not bring myself to like the flavor it all ended up in the trash this is definitely a chip that will appeal to only certain palates i do like the sweet onion flavor of this brand but this asian flavor was too much of a good thing,too much of a good thing
11099,i loved kettle chips from the moment i tried them but i felt absolutely disgusting every time i had the kettle brand though very tasty and crunchy they were also very oily with deep river snacks they have got the crunch and taste without that repulsive burst of oil in your mouth with each crunch that kettle brand had i love the sweet onion maui and mesquite bbq the jalapeno flavor does spicy justice and the rosemary olive oil is very unique for a chip i wish they had a sour cream and onion flavor but i love them regardless,yum
11100,i did a search on amazon for kettle reduced fat chips hoping to find a good deal on kettle brand chips i stumbled upon these deep river reduced fat kettle chips and liked the per bag price works out to about per bag about half the price of a similarly sized bag of kettle brand chips at my local grocery store i am so glad i ordered these i love the taste and i love the texture and never would have guessed they were reduced fat i particularly like the short list of ingredients potatoes sunflower or corn oil and salt that is it br br i do wish amazon would make it easy to find the nutritional information so here are the basics chip serving g is calories g fat g fiber br br i will definitely order these again,delicious great texture ingredients
11101,they are a healthier chip with less salt and fat which i like better than the over salted regular chips on the market the flavor is great and they are nice and crunchy absolutely worth a try,good product
11102,love these chips good for a quick snack and i do not fee too guilty eating them since they have less fat and salt than regular chips highly recommended,excellent chips
11103,you know you have a great salt vinegar chip when after one individual bag your mouth is all puckered up br deep river makes a great chip and comes in packages just the right size for one person to enjoy and being kettle chips just makes each bite a great taste and texture combination you are sure to enjoy br try some now br http www amazon com gp product b c xa ref cm cr rev prod title,deep river salt vinegar chips
11104,the sweet maui onion tastes like sour cream and onion i was hoping to get the delicious chips that i enjoyed in maui do not wast your time,yuk
11105,olive oil in large bold print on the front of the bag is misleading olive oil is not the main oil the chips are cooked in the product has more sunflower corn and canola oils than it does olive oil the ingredients are not listed in the description i should have known better br there are other much better olive oil potato chips on the market that use only olive oil i was quite disappointed in this brand,disappointed
11106,i love salt vinegar kettle chips so i decided to try these after reading good reviews when i received them i noticed from the very first bag that over half of the chips were inedible due to rotten potatoes i know how kettle chips should look and i know what normal marks look like on chips these were rotten after waiting over a month for a response from the company i finally found a phone number and called them only to be told there was nothing they could do the sad thing is the chips that were edible were actually flavorful and tasty obviously they just do not care about consistent quality so stay away from these chips,too many rotten chips
11107,the kettle chip itself is crisp crunchy and good although somewhat greasy over coated with the flavoring causing mouth burn when it was not expected in a chip with rosemary flavoring leaves greasy gritty residue on fingers after two or three chips,flavor too strong coating too messy
11108,i ordered these because i had purchased a bag of sweet maui onion chips from the supermarket they were so good that i had to get another br br the order came and i popped open a bag they are very crunchy so if you are into that these are the chips for you however they do tend to get really salty i found myself having quite a few sips of beer when eating these,crunchy but a bit on the salty side
11109,i bought these potato chips because they sounded tasty and because of the natural sounding ingredients but also specifically because they are gluten free i have a son with food allergies and he cannot gluten or milk i was so upset when i received these to find out that they contain milk i do not see this information anywhere on the product page,misleading allergen info
11110,i have got to believe these other reviewers have not actually looked at the list of ingredients that make up these chips here they are br br ingredients sugar partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil coconut oil lactose whey natural and artificial flavors including barley protein non fat milk buttermilk solids sodium caseinate soy lecithin an emulsifier salt artificial colors yellow lake yellow lake blue lake br br now i must admit that i did not look at the label either i have been using nestle chocolate chips for years and i thought it was a name i could trust apparently not br br so let me tell you how i discovered what the ingredients were i was making brownies for the kids for a semi special occasion so i bought the premium white morsels thinking they were white chocolate and these butterscotch ones i dumped them in my batter and noticed when i took the brownies out that the chips did not seem to have melted i did not think anything of it until i sampled some of the white morsels for a snack very waxy on the tongue not nice like good chocolate would be so i tried the butterscotch ones where the heck was the flavor br br well i was shocked when i read the label i had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be chocolate free and i assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings br br i mean look at the ingredients there is more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk and there is a whopping grams of sugar in teaspoon of these things which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it was not for the grams of trans fats laden goo that was also in them br br in any case i have thrown out the rest of these two bags if the health concerns were not bad enough they do not taste good really sweet more than flavorful and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel br br pam t br mom blogger brownie baker,nice and waxy
11111,i love nestle chips but the top of the box bags and the bottoms were half way melted and i could not find anyone in amazon to complain to i really wish i could figure out where you complain to amazon i know how to complain to the stores but not to amazon itself,melted
11112,i was wondering how my cookies which were a spin on the america test kitchen perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe could have come out tasting like crud well it was the butterscotch chips i basically took atk recipe and adjusted it for oatmeal insead of the chocolate chip by using their base and adding oats raisins chopped mac nuts cinnamon and these chips it would have been just as amazing as the chocolate chip cookie recipe if i would have ommitted these chips now as another reviewer said the cookies with the chips in it are destined for the trash,yuck
11113,this was great coffee and i would order this again my husband loves this particular one because it is mild and has a great flavor as well,wonderful coffee
11114,this lemon salt is ok but the salt is not infused with the lemon the lemon is mixed with salt granuals so might as well use lemon,passable
11115,these are great treats in fact they are the only thing i use for my dog but this price seem way wrong so far off as to possibly be incorrect in my local petsmart they are,seems expensive
11116,i saw the price on amazon and i jumped at it it was a great deal compared to others that i found on the internet bought the box of jelly belly tangerine jelly beans as wedding favors great steal,satisfied
11117,my fiance loves fortune cookies so i figured this would be a great creative way to pop the question well she loved the idea when i finally did it last friday although somehow she had me figured out from the beginning lol br br anyway i was not particularly thrilled about the quality of these cookies the seams were not completely shut i could see the word will through the backside of the cookie br br also a huge warning for someone looking for an authentic cookie to give the wrapper is just that a plain plastic wrapper i was expecting some chinese lettering or some kind of design to make it a little more believeable br br and last but not least the price for the quality you are getting i would be more inclined to try the trick tutorials online of opening up a cookie and placing the message inside myself at least then i could put exactly what i wanted they are way overpriced for what you are getting br br buy only out of desperation,gets the job done
11118,i bought this olive oil because of the testing done by university california davis in early the results showed that this product passed for being extra virgin olive oil for all samples and it was the only imported oil to the united states of tested that passed all samples it seems to be more potent because it is spicier than the trader joe organic brand which cost less you do know that about of all extra virgin olive oil products are not extra virgin olive oil five stars because it is a decent price and i trust this product for being extra virgin more than other name brands br this oil is from italy which means this oil is milled in october or november or december as with all northern hemisphere olive oils the southern hemisphere olive oils are milled in june and july,really is extra virgin olive oil
11119,i have been using canola sunflower and peanut oil my entire life but after reading about the health benefits of extra virgin olive oil or evoo anti cancer anti inflammatory good for digestive system bones etc i decided to change to evoo and according to the uc davis study this brand was one of the imported oils that was actually evoo and not a mixture of different kinds of olive oil and unbelievably this is even better than whole foods brand evoo and the best part is this is the cheapest of the that passed this test and i would recommend you to buy this at costco where you can buy l for and i have been told that if you do not have a membership you can buy a costco gift card and use it to shop for things like this br br the below information is taken from br br the other approved brands are br corto olive br california olive ranch br mcevoy ranch organic br br and the brands found to have be fraudulently labeled as extra virgin br whole foods br rachel ray br safeway br newman own br colavita br bertolli br filippo berio br pompeian br star br carapelli br mezzetta br mazzola br br this is the best evoo out there and i would recommend this to my friends,the best olive oil
11120,i have purchased this at costco several times and the quality seemed to be lacking this purchase through amazon was superior i am not certain why there is a quality difference i would definitely check this out,great olive oil
11121,stuff inside is good but olive oil containers should be dark to block sunlight and i prefer glass containers to plastic,good product lousy container
11122,i decided to purchase kirkland organic evoo based on other reviews and on a university of california study that lists kirkland as the least likely to be adulterated with non evoo oils i was surprised and delighted with the flavor and adaptability of kirkland organic extra virgin olive oil and will purchase it again it is a great bargain compared to the other two or three certified oils and the taste is wonderful a general note the plastic container kirkland organic extra virgin olive oil is sold in is sturdy and solid but i choose to re bottle the oil in glass when i receive it as i do not to store cooking or salad oils in plastic bottles i would gladly pay the extra dollar it might cost to purchase the item packaged in glass,a real surprise
11123,i have been consuming olives and olive oil for years and years for its nutritional value i cook with olive oil or use it as dressing or add few spoons into my dish since i need the good unsaturated fat contained in olives in in my diet all vegetable oils are processed and diluted including light or extra light olive oil which is a highly refined oil without the nutritional value i use much more expensive extra virgin olive oils which taste very fruity and sharp from eu but i have been to their farms and know the product real well and trust the producer as well unfortunately olive oil being the gold standard of the cooking oil is produced and mixed with other oils and adulterated by many for financial gain but not this one since it is pure olive oil only extra virgin the first round of olives that have been pressed have the antioxidants not refined or mixed with other oils i keep the oils in the freezer away from heat and light all the time bravo,organic
11124,i use this in cooking and also as a skin care product first time that i have tried olive oil as a moisturizer and i absolutely love it this is one brand that i will buy again it is great and gentle on the skin,great
11125,this is a must have in my home i use olive oil for everything my skin hair cooking taking off makeup this is great quality organic virgin olive oil and i am in heaven,great size great product and great price
11126,asin b ik qzo kirkland organic extra virgin olive oil br i purchased this olive oil based on testing performed by university california davis back in early i ve found of no new testing since then the results rated kirkland brand extra virgin olive oil samples provided for testing and it was the only imported oil to the united states of tested that passed not sure what the test were the oil tastes very complex like fine wine very fruity and sharp to me only extra virgin is made from the first cold pressing first pressing olives and offers they say up to antioxidants great taste and all the nutrients that olives have to offer that is why it is cloudy unfiltered after i open the main container which i keep it in freezer and place a small container in refrigerator and refill as necessary keeping it away from light heat at all times enjoy it is worth the extra,kirkland organic extra virgin olive oil
11127,shucks i have ordered the same extra virgin olive oil before however at the time i paid for liters not next time i have to pay better attention to size price not saying the oil is not worth it just have to shop for better prices br br i am editing my review b c i realized only after i have ordered used the oil for the first time that i mistakenly orderd the organic kind again kirkland extra virgin olive tastes great but for me it does not have to be the organic kind to make it special the price seems just about right if not even super for this type of quality organi label,good product great taste
11128,coffee has good flavor but i find it to be a little on the weak side so i use more than one bag per pot and thus removes the convenience of using bags in the first place,good but a little weak
11129,i do not mean good for a gluten free cookie or almost like a normal cookie no i mean that as a cookie they are good no strange textures odd flavors or smells no sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture they basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free no milk or butter either so i believe they should be casein free also according to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well br br that a mighty impressive list of good stuff you are probably wondering what the catch is right it definitely is not the taste as i said at the beginning these are very very good i only see two drawbacks br cost most gluten free foods are expensive so this one is not unexpected br quantity the ounce package contains cookies br br cookies really does not seem like that many particularly when enjoying them however that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us i know i have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much i am eating only to find i have eaten the entire bag since the package is a built in pause stop point the smaller size less overeating even so i still wish there were more in a package br br one last note just because i found it to be unusual normally all the cookies would be packed the same way i e two rows of eight these aren t instead there are two rows of seven cookies each side by side and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated degrees from the others there is not anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space it is just not how most packaged cookies are packaged nor is it symmetrical so it sticks out as unusual to me,these are good very very good
11130,i am on a gluten free diet and find most gluten free snack high in calories and fat these cookies are awesome the serving size is cookies calorie count per serving is between and and fat is between and great flavor and crunch and almost healthy,great cookies
11131,finally a cookie that taste great if you have eaten any gluten free cookies before you know they are bland these cookies are awesome the best part is i dont have to worry about my multiple food allergies i would recommend them to anyone who loves cookies like me,yeah
11132,i love dr lucy cookies all the flavors are terrific i do not eat them because they are gluten free i have no allergies but i am a vegetarian who usually eats vegan i often crumble these or the sugar cookie flavor on top of a bowl of coconut milk ice cream it spectacular,just delicious
11133,i am on a gluten free diet and find most gluten free snack high in calories and fat these cookies are awesome the serving size is cookies calorie count per serving is between and and fat is between and great flavor and crunch and almost healthy,gluten free and great tasting
11134,an acquaintance shared dr lucy cookies with me and i was just amazed at the taste i have never had a healthy cookie that was crunchy like eating a homemade cookie made with love because it took a mother love and dedication to create these amazing cookies looking forward to more flavors thanks dr lucy,cookie cravings
11135,i have been searching for a tasty gluten free cookie cookie for several years a taste that was equal to the cookies of regular eating days lucy oatmeal cookies ended the quest they are delicious they are also a perfect size for a quick snack and ever so satisfying the calorie content is also good i am anxious to try other varieties,finally
11136,these cookies are great even greater since they have no gluten no dairy no eggs and are light crispy and oh so good this is a phenomenal price too and i love the small snack pack size thanks amazon and thanks dr lucy who lives one town over from me,excellent gluten free and dairy free oatmeal
11137,are these really gluten free because they sure do not taste like it there are a few other cookies being marketed as gluten free or diet but there simply is no comparison to these nuggets of goodness frankly even given the choice between these and something like a pillsbury or toll house oven baked cookie i would take lucy cookies in a heartbeat no guilt no high glycemic index to make you feel like you just gained five pounds no impulse to hibernate just moist sweet morsels that make you wonder why the bag is not three inches deeper seriously lucy you need to make them deeper and the inspiring story behind the creation of lucy cookies will make you feel that much better knowing that you are supporting a homegrown business rather than a huge multi national i cannot recommend these enough,good grief these cookies are delicious
11138,what a wonderful surprise to find lucy on amazon com i have not enjoyed a cookie as much as i enjoy lucy since going gluten free several years ago br br they have that just right crunch br they are just sweet enough not too not not br they are just the right size br they have just the right mmmmm factor br br thank you dr lucy for sharing the lemonade you made from the dietary lemons life gave you too you have given me many appreciated mmmmmmm mmmmmm mmmmmmm moments br catsy,mmmmmmmmmm
11139,i used to love every flavor of these cokies i was the one buying out the entire shelf at wfoods i started ordering on amazon multiple packs at a time i could easily eat boxes a day by myself i eat really healthy and my sweets is the only thing i give myself what i want i am vegan and prefer to eat gluten free as i am supposed to due to healh issues but do not always because there are no other gf desserts that are vegan that i love so boy was i disappointed when i had to stop buying them very mcuh because they changed the fat and calories significantly i wonder i anyone else noticed i wrote to dr lucy and she replied i asked if i could still order some from her int he original formulation or where i could buy them like that but she said no the only reasons she gave were some type of problem with the formulation and baking f the cookie but i do not understand beacause they were perfect a better explanation would have been nice so thus i am very disappointed in this line which was the only gf vegan low fat low cal delicious line of desserts i enjoyed and now cannot eat them very often at all when i am consuming large amounts i am sorry but g of fat for a whole box vs g fat box for the old cookies cannot do it dang lucy i miss my sweet yumminess,used to own stock in the company but changed their formulation and get a much lower rating
11140,i am in the health food industry and i am gluten intolerant i have tried many different gf cookies in the last ten years i bought a box of lucy chocolate chip cookies last night at safeway i was not impressed the cookie was dry almost to the point of being stale this is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours lucy cookies remind me of pamela cookies which are also dry being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of however what i cannot stand is an after taste the base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment i had from this cookie i looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours i cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste i have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste i would suggest either udi frozen cookies or glutino cookies i find these two brands superior to lucy thanks for reading,dry with after taste
11141,these cookies are very similar to garden variety wheat based chocolate chip cookies they have similar texture and snap but these are both vegan and gluten free which matches my requirements my celiac disease makes me very sensitive to wheat and these cookies do not trigger any reaction br br the cookies are if anything a little more crisp than most but not at all hard or difficult to chew they certainly contain sugar i do not eat these everyday because they are so sweet but i do like them and may very well subscribe to them br br if i were rating these only on flavor and texture i would give them stars but lucy annoyed me by creating a bizzarre nutrition panel each package contains cookies they state it is servings then go on to say one serving has calories so each package seems to contain calories possibly over some people limit for a snack but let us be honest these cookies with lots of organic cane sugar have a lot of calories each cookie must weigh in at a bit over calories br br for years we have known that is the answer to life the universe and everything now we know it is a cookie worth of calories too tasty calories will buy again,ecellent vegan gluten free cookies no tummy aches
11142,i bought these cookies after reading all the rave reviews but they were very dry did not have much chocolate and left an unpleasant aftertaste i do not understand what all the fuss is about if these were the only gf cookies available i still would not buy them again,nothing special
11143,while i am not gluten intolerant i am trying to reduce my gluten intake for health reasons and snacks seem to be the best way to to try and curb my intake since snacks of this type are not a dietary requirement much as i would wish they were i have the ability to chose any cookie gluten free or not i am lucky in that i can afford to be a little picky i had tried a few other weird bland gluten free options and wow these cookies really surprised me the are actually very good crispy no weird off tastes just like a real cookie nice size for dunking in a cold cup of lactose free milk without getting lost or soggy i deducted one star because they could use a few more chips sprinkled in there br br they are a little expensive but i do not mind the price point considering that the factory goes to great lengths to protect against cross contamination from allergens and gluten plus being a little pricey i am less likely to eat more than one pack at a time i am looking forward to trying the four flavor combo pack next time,nom nom nom stars from a non gluten free mom
11144,the cookies are great tasting especially for gluten free i will definitely buy them again and again the consistency is like a regular chip ahoy,tasty cookies
11145,i absolutely love dr lucy gluten free chocolate chip cookies they are a delight to everyone whether you are on a gluten free diet or not the best part is they are only calories for cookies and for a college student trying to look good in a bikini that is very important for me i highly recommend everyone try these delicious cookies they will not disappoint,better than chips ahoy and better for you too
11146,i have three children and seven nieces nephews ages to months lucy cookies are the staple snack dessert treat in our household b c of the allergies a few of us have the cookies the taste flavor the packaging and the crunch are loved by all of us we always have them on hand and glad to have them ready for us to order on amazon lucy cookies a p s during the school year they are great to pack in my daughter lunch box b c they follow the school rules,lucy cookies a
11147,these are very very good tasting crispy cookies especially delicious when dipped in milk they say gluten free and i totally believe they are because i did not have a wheat type reaction but i have to say i always feel miserable after eating these cookies br someone else mentions how they are too sweet etc etc i do not think they taste too sweet and they have g of sugar per serving which does not seem like it is that much considering most other sweets have more sugars per serving take a look at gatorade for example br that said it does seem to be some kind of a reaction to the sugar because immediately after eating them i feel like my body is dumping into some kind of sugar coma i start to feel like lead and lightheaded they also mess up my tummy maybe it is the type of sugar they use evaporated cane juice is the st ingredient and they also contain kinds of cellulose which i think are sugars also but i could be wrong br anyhow i gave stars for taste because they are that good but keep in mind you may feel like you need a lengthy nap to recover from eating them br br i agree with the previous poster they should do something about this i do not want stevia or artificial sweeteners in them but maybe try using less sugar or a different kind of sugar like organic brown i have no idea but i would never let a kid eat more than of these at a time for fear it would make them just pass out br i eat other sweet stuff and nothing makes me feel this bizarrely over sugared br br i m not even totally sure it is the sugar that makes you feel this way any ideas it is a shame because they are so delicious i have tried them several times and may keep them on hand for a once in a blue moon craving but i definitely will not be eating them often,delicious but something is awry
11148,these cookies are small grainy and very crunchy with an awful aftertaste and very expensive for such a small package of cookies might be great for multiple allergies but i was very disappointed,not that great
11149,for what is is this cookie is pretty good does it taste like the soft under baked buttery kind you get from a bakery or your favorite shoppe no however it does satisfy a sweet tooth in my opinion these taste just like a less sweet version of the chips ahoy brand i ate as a kid,pretty good for what is is
11150,i love a crisp cookie that you can dip in milk these are crisp delicious and light and they travel well for my peanut allergic grandaughter she is four and its a great thing when we can find things she loves and can eat without worry,cookies that taste good
11151,these are some of the best cookies i have found without allergens in them i love that they come individually packed so i can grab them to go or put them in my lunch,lucys chocolate chip cookies
11152,my son is on a restricted diet due to allergies and he is very picky it was hard to find things that he would even try after tasting one of these cookies he was hooked now this is a favorite snack of his,my sons is on a gfcf diet
11153,terrific flavor good crisp texture and just the right amount of sugar sprinkles make this a winner lucy cookies are my go to br dessert,gluten free tastes great
11154,i bought the chocolate chip and they are delicious regardless of the fact that they are gluten free these cookies are good enough to stand on their own br br i gave my father one to try and he loved it he had no idea they are gluten free,chocolate chip
11155,i bought lucy cookies because i saw them on dr oz as a guilt free cookie i bought the oatmeal and i love them i am on weight watchers and i calculated them at point plus each wow a point cookie needless to say i am eating them but i am eating cookies and losing weight my husband is not on weight watchers and loves them too i want to try the other flavors so i will order them but i will definitely re order the oatmeal this week,yummy crunchy sweet and boxes almost gone already
11156,great seller fast shipping i love these cookies i have many allergies and i have no problems when eating these i will be ordering more,lucy sugar cookies
11157,these are the best gfcf cookies ever even better than i can make at home and they are awesome for quick lunch packing,best gfcf cookies
11158,lucy cinnamon thin cookies while a little pricy are quite tasty i like to let them get slightly stale so that they are chewy although that does not happen often because they are usually gone too quickly,they are great
11159,i bought these on a whim at my local gluten free store these cookies taste amazing br to me they taste like cinnamon toast crunch cereal br br unfortunately i have a sweet tooth and need to refrain from buying every week br they are just too tasty i want to eat the whole box,o m g these cookies are delicious
11160,this cookies are really tasty and i will definitely be reordering i ordered the package of small bags to be able to have a snack to carry with me to places unlikely to have anything gluten free and i am glad i ordered this product if one is signed up for the autodelivery program the price is pretty reasonable the little bag of cookies helps me with portion control because if i had the whole box i would probably plow right through them they are very flavorful and taste just like cinnamony snickerdoodles there is no weird aftertaste as with many gf foods i have also had the oatmeal cookies and found them crispy too but much more bland they would be good with coffee i have even considered crushing the cinnamon thins to make a crust for cheesecake but have not tried that yet would buy a box to do so to avoid the need to open multiple bags the cookies are very crispy so if that is an issue for you take note i know my false toothed father would have to soak these in milk to be able to eat them but i believe he would think they were worth it,just like snickerdoodles
11161,i bought these after having them at starbucks and i loved them im always looking for a weight watcher friendly snack and these fit the bill they are four weight watcher plus points and are delicious,really good
11162,this is a very flavorful cookie with a nice texture it is also low in carb i have used the crumbs from these cookes to replace a grahmcracker crust and was extreemly pleased with the results it is my only must have in stock cookee,lucy cinnamon thins
11163,glad i gave them a try they are expensive but all gluten free foods i purchase are they taste the closest to the best cookies i used to purchase before having to go gluten free will purchase again,best ever
11164,i went on a search for dairy free chocolate and found these great cookies we believed my breastfed son was sensitive to milk and having to avoid dairy when you are a chocoholic is very difficult these cookies helped to feed my chocolate cravings and helped keep my sanity in those difficult first weeks with a newborn at first i thought they tasted just a bit different they are a lot crunchier than regular chocolate chip cookies and they do not taste exactly the same however after being off of dairy and munching on these cookies i began to not notice a difference my picky husband also said they were good,chocolate chip cookies
11165,lucy is one of the very few baked goods available that omits all the major sources of food intollerances gluten dairy and eggs more importantly they are delicious when we cannot find a local source for lucy cookies we always ordered them on line,only cookie that considers all intollerances tastes good
11166,i love crisp sugar cookies these were perfect tasted like regular gluten cookies will buy over and over,love these cookies
11167,these cookies have no milk no egss no nuts no gluten and no cholesterol or trans fat which common sense says should make them taste like cardboard if not even worse i do not know how they did it but these chocolate chip cookies are delicious they actual taste like chocolate chip cookies should taste if you have got allergies try these cookies you will love them,they are amazing
11168,these are the only glutten free cookies i eat they are crunchy and go great with coffee and tea,great glutten free cookies
11169,my daughter loves these we both have gluten sensitivities so we were so happy to find these,lucy gluten free chocolate chip cookies
11170,these are so great for a gf kid or adult and for the whole family we are hooked on the chocolate chip but we like the oatmeal and cinnamon a lot too and its great that they come in individual packs or full sized cookies pretty healthy and all natural ingredients what could be wrong they are great we recommend them,thank you dr lucy
11171,these cinnamon thin cookies looked appealing in the package so i bought some i did not buy them because they were gluten free i just like anything that tastes good whether it is low fat fattening gluten free low carb etc and they are really good and surprisingly satisfying for being gluten free make sure that if you eat them while having coffee that you dunk quick if you like to dunk your cookies i order or boxes at a time and will continue to in the future because now they are a favorite that i eat practically every day,very tasty cinnamon thins
11172,my review is for the cinnamon cookie in the small bag i love them i do not have gluten issues but i like the fact that the cookies are gluten free they are crunchy and satisfy my desire for something sweet only caloriesand g of fat in three cookies each pack has cookies g of saturated fat trans fat cholesterol mg sodium g fiber g of carbs and g of protein yummy every bite starbucks carries them sporadically and i am so glad to be able to buy them from amazon,delicious and healthy
11173,to all of you gluten free people out there who thought that you could not eat chocolate chip cookies anymore think again these are so delicisious taht you will not miss the wheat they are the best wheat free cookies i have found i could eat half a box at a time but i try not to,gluten free yumminess
11174,a fabulous compilation of cinnamon and crunch sweet and glulten free pricey but worth it,great cookies
11175,if you have serious food allergies or gluten intolerance you probably bake your own and are not reading this review but what a joy to find dr lucy cookies in starbucks recently yes these are boxed cookies not to be confused with homemade which is the sterling standard for me but given that they are lovely the body of the cookie is slightly bean flavored since that is what the flour blend relies on but it is not an obtrusive flavor just a bit tangy the milk free chips are great nicely rounded flavor not burnt or sharp the texture is pleasantly crisp sandy not tough not hard not chewy great with coffee or tea our favorite is the chocolate chip variety but the cinnamon and sugar cookies versions are delicious also if you are not allergic yourself but considering buying some for guests or grandchildren who are then i would encourage you to go for it you will find you munch on them too because they are just yummy little crunchy cookies,yummy little crunchy cookies
11176,i discovered these at my local starbucks and loved them the sugar cookies are wonderful have a nice crunch and leave no aftertaste the easiest way for me to explain the taste of the sugar cookie is to tell you they taste remind me of christmas sugar cookies the chocolate chip are good and the cinnamon are too but the sugar is my favorite it is so hard to find gluten free snacks that taste great and do not leave you yearning for a real snack buy them,very good
11177,after being diagnosed as a celiac recently finding products that are tasty and gluten free really challenged me i traded off tasty for decent tasting after a while but finally i have found something that actually tastes good the crunchy texture makes me feel satisfied after finishing the bag these cookies are truly delicious and well worth the journey to find them since god has not healed me yet i am so thankful that he let me find these,wow
11178,i have documented food allergies and it is very difficult to find decent goodies these are the best allergy friendly cookies i have tasted yet i tried them for the first time today i needed to use up a starbucks gift certificate and found these cookies in a basket in the front of the store boy was i pleased when i discovered they were as good as any cookie made with wheat and eggs not the bland dry grainy taste of most gf cookies also the price is much better than many of the other allergy friendly products i have tried you will not be disapointed in these,best allergy friendly cookies i ever had
11179,i am not gf but my year old daughter is and i like to try everything with her she almost did not get to eat any of them because they were soooo good i am normally not a crispy cookie kind of girl but the flavor of these cookies was better than even most nongf cookies i have had we bought a small package from starbucks and will definitely be purchasing many more from whole foods,yum
11180,these are delicious discovered them while i was at starbucks last week i ve tried the cinnamon thins and the sugar cookies and they are both great a nice healthier option even for people without food allergies now i am just waiting for my local grocery stores to get in the game would love to be able to purchase these in stores,yummy
11181,these cookies have a great flavor and no aftertaste that i can detect i do not find them gritty at all they are quite crispy but i like that i think they are as good as any regular sugar cookie i have ever had and my non gf friends agree,wonderful
11182,i am very pleased with the light crispy texture and sweet taste so far the best gf oatmeal cookie i have found it does not have a traditional chewy oatmeal texture but still great and even better available through amazon,light and crispy cookie
11183,these are fabulous i saw in an online review of dr lucy cookies someone complaining about broken cookies when they arrived yes some of the cookies will be broken though not a lot i think they break because of their unusual texture i wish i knew the trick of making a cookie like this they taste great but a big part of what i just love about these cookies is their texture it is that airyness and crispness personally they are addictive i finished my first two boxes i had bought as a test one of the pack boxes in cinnamon and one in sugar and sadly after a month or so i had eaten them all i tried baking something simliar and could not do it though when i have mroe time i will give it many more tries so just a couple days ago i ordered a pack box or cinnamon sugar and now i am trying for the first time the oatmeal i do recommend these cookies they are my afternoon treat one pack of cookies only calories and a good cup of decaf coffee and i am fine till dinner,crispy airy
11184,these were wonderful i do not know how they make these so crunchy and airy at the same time i bought a pack box of these and got in the habit of having a bag only calories for good sized cookies of these every afternoon when i got sluggish i began to look forward to their cinnamony taste and was bummed when i finally finished all of them i tried to make some like them and it was a sad failure so just a couple of days ago i ordered another box of these and the sugar cookies they are wonderful too and i even ordered the oatmeal ones so i can try those and see if they are as good as the others i highly recommend these,yummy
11185,i absolutely love these cookies i bought them when they orginally had a discount on them and at first bite i fell in love having celiacs it is really hard to find a good cookie but the oatmeal in these make them taste homemade if the price was better i would have give it stars great for lunches or to send with kids when they cannot have regular treats,great cookies
11186,i cannot thank you enough my son has autism and is an extremely picky eater having food allergies made his food choices even harder your product is healthy and so convenient when your taking a lot of your own food everywhere not to mention delicious thanks again for putting the fun joy back into eating cookies for my little guy for so many others wishing you much sweet success,dr lucy brought nothing but smilies to my picky eater
11187,lucy cinnamon thins are crispy yummy and entirely too tempting they taste like snickerdoodles and i cannot quit eating them,oh my gosh delicious
11188,my daughter tried these cookies at a celiac camp she was at and fell in love wih them in addition to her loving the cookies what is great about them is their grab bag type being gluten dairy perservative dye free often she feels different and a little embarrassed with the types of foods she eats this size is like having something most of her peers eat but it is healthy another benefit is her non gluten sensitive brother also loves them that is the real test if the gluten eating kids like it,awesome cookies and great package size
11189,when i first tried the cookie i was not expecting it to be so crispy i did not like it until after a few bites they definetly took care of my sweet tooth i would recommend these to any one with food allergies,tasty and sweet
11190,for a store bought cookie these are good very crunchy and a good flavor br br even if you do not have dietary restrictions these are worth trying,crunchy goodness
11191,these cookies are great they have a slight tapioca flour taste but i am very sensitive to that the chocolate chip ones are even better thank you dr lucy for a low calorie gluten free treat,great crunchy sweet treat
11192,i have celiac disease and have tried several brands of gluten free bought cookies as i call them i have always been disappointed and resorted to baking my own although baking my own is fine sometimes i would like the convenience of being able to have cookies on hand when the urge strikes or to grab when i am on the go i ordered a case each of the oatmeal and the sugar cookies and was very pleased with both of them although i slightly favored the oatmeal i purposely tried to detect the usual off taste that i have found in other cookies there is no off taste to either of these flavors both cookies are crisp just the way i like them i have just one word for them yummy,i was pleasantly surprised at how good these cookies are
11193,these are pretty darn good cookies i prefer a href http www amazon com gp product b iauq lucy cinnamon thins ounce boxes pack of a but these are a close second br br the cookies are crunchy not chewy they do have a lot of sugar on the top but it is only noticeable if you have several at a time seemed sweeter to me than the cinnamon thins br br not crumbly or cakey no funky taste br br only in the package not very many at all putting that in a positive light you can consider it built in portion control handy if you are like me and sometimes happen to snack without actually paying attention to how much you are eating,yummy
11194,for those of us who cannot digest gluten finally there is a cookie that tastes delicious and is easy on the stomach,delicious gluten free
11195,these cookies are the best they are very crispy and taste great with a bowl of coconut milk ice cream the reviewer who thought they had an aftertaste or grainy texture is reacting to something i cannot taste at all these are yummier than all the wheat based commercial sugar cookies i have tasted,yum
11196,we love dr lucy cookies the cookies have a delightful crisp crunch while maintaining the consistency of a regular cookie i would not have guessed they were gluten milk egg free my son is hooked as am i,delicious
11197,it is so great to have a low fat low calorie yet delicious brand of cookies available i do not feel guilty after eating a few and trust me you will eat a few i have a friend with a gluten allergy and its great to have something to offer her when she comes over that i can enjoy as well definitely worth trying,love the sugar cookies
11198,as someone who has been at this for a very long time wheat free that is i have tried dozens and dozens of gluten free cookies br a cookie a holic i have to have my morning coffee with a cookie br up until this point most of the gluten free cookies have been huge disappointments br i have thrown more practically full boxes of cookies in the trash than i care to remember they were just not worth the calories they were that bad br i do like pamela brand biscotti cookies but they are the only other cookie i have found good enough to spend the money on br and lets face it prejudice abounds in the gluten free aisle everything is outrageously expensive br but these they are lovely crunchy no grainy texture no strange after taste vegan low calorie and low fat actually a miracle of a cookie br most gluten free cookies are loaded with fat and as i limit fat content that was another big draw back br no problem here though only grams of fat per cookie serving br i have tried all flavors and each is excellent i do not think any would disappoint,truly the best
11199,these cookies are delicious and great for a sweet treat if you are on weight watchers however they are expensive so i was thrilled to find them at a much more reasonable price,yum
11200,dr lucy has created an absolute masterpiece these cookies are delicious for everyone there are so many additives in today food that it is nice to know that there is a product that is completely natural you also have the feeling that you can trust this product since you know that she created this for her own child the calorie count is less than other cookies and it also does nto affect diabetics as significantly as regular cookies do i highly recommend this product as well as her other cookies while i do love chocolate chip my absolute favorite would be the cinnamon enjoy,all natural and delicious
11201,i have a son who is allergic to milk eggs peanuts and tree nuts however he can eat wheat we have tried lots of allergy friendly products and are sometimes disappointed with the wheat free ones as the texture and taste is often very different from products made with traditional ingredients that is not the case with these cookies they are by far the best allergy friendly cookies that we have tried yet they have a nice crisp but not hard cookie texture i was also impressed with the shelf life on the cookies that we tried many allergy friendly cookies have a very short shelf life but the lucy cookies that we tried today did not expire until october way to go dr lucy on creating an excellent allergy friendly product,what a treat
11202,as a relative of a child with severe food allergies i have always struggled with what to serve when the child comes to visit until i heard of then tasted these gems not only are they super safe for children or anyone with food allergies they are delicious i find myself purchasing some just when i get a cookie craving they are hands down the best line of cookies i have ever had great flavor you would never know that these were produced with safe products rather than traditional cookie ingredients i think one of the hardest thing for parents and relatives and friends of people with allergies is finding good tasty foods especially sweets if you have a loved one with a food allergy i think you should stock these in your pantry but beware you will find yourself craving them as well,run don t walk to purchase lucy cookies
11203,absolutely delicious cookies crisp crunchy but not hard sweet but not too much so since a lot of the gluten free foods i have tried have left imho something to be desired these were a very pleasant surprise the grandkids love them too a true test of cookie goodness br br i can buy these locally for about per ounce box i offer this info so that buyers can decide if amazon current price whatever it may be is a bargain br br highly recommended,cinnamon thins yum
11204,i am on a gluten free diet and find most gluten free snack high in calories and fat these cookies are awesome the serving size is cookies calorie count per serving is between and and fat is between and great flavor and crunch and almost healthy,awesome cookies
11205,i was shopping for sugar free cookies so they suggested other sugar free cookies and i selected them unfortunately i am a diabetic and when i received the lucy chocolate chip cookies not only were they assorted flavors which i didnt order but they were not sugar free why would they suggest these i have no idea but i am very upset,item says lucy chocoalte chip
11206,as a mom with celiac disease with one son that has a tree nut allergy and another that has a soy allergy i really wanted to like these cookies we are used to cooking everything from scratch to ensure the safety of our food would not it be great to have a cookie that my tree nut allergic son and i could grab on the go i paid a visit to my local starbucks to pick up a oz pack of the sugar cookies and excitedly opened the package the smell alone was enough to immediately turn me off the bag had a synthetic odd smell inside i took a bite of the cookie and noted its crunchiness a good thing about the cookie but then was overwhelmed by an extremely unpleasant aftertaste it almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor a very odd and unpalatable taste indeed i was so disappointed i really liked the story of dr lucy and the idea of the cookie but most definitely did not like the cookie although i would classify myself as a bit of a food snob with high standards i put that aside when reviewing this cookie i do not think even the less discerning customer would enjoy this cookie,awful
11207,i bought a package of these at starbucks and thought good crispy hmmmm so i bought a case of a mix cinnamon sugar chocolate chip and oatmeal first they all tasted the same they are probably suppose to be crispy but they taste stale and then they leave an awful aftertaste they also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package br br there is nothing special about these and are not worth the price although i love the packaging br br sorry lucy i have tasted way better gf cookies,yuck
11208,these are the worst gluten free cookies i have ever tasted they were hard dry and tasted like tapioca flour avoid these at all cost,lucy chocolate chip cookies
11209,i do not have any dietary restrictions i bought these because of an price reduction i would not purchase them again they have very few chocolate chips like you have to hunt for them in the cookie that is not what chocolate chip cookies should be about br br the oatmeal version of these cookies is much better,where is the chocolate
11210,these are hands down the best roasted and salted almonds i have had addictive yet healthy,the best
11211,i could live off of these i am not kidding the regular salted almonds are good too but i prefer the smokehouse almonds,yes
11212,i love almonds in general and this particular brand is quite good they taste great with just the right amount of salt and oil for me anyway br br they re individually packaged in oz cans which makes them an easy and portable snack portion control is also easier with the small can size br br i ve ordered a few packs of these almonds and while there is some slight variation in the taste from batch to batch some are roasted a bit darker than others i have always found them fresh and tasty br br almonds are relatively healthy too high in protein a good source of magnesium calcium and manganese and full of unsaturated fats br br i have not seen organic roasted salted almonds from this company but i hope they offer them eventually at a decent price one thing i would also like to see is some kind of assurance that the can liner is free of bpa,tasty healthy good price
11213,very tasty and great for a late night snack a sitting at your desk snack and or a traveling treat if you are not a big fan of salty treats steer clear,a flavorite treat
11214,yup no stray pieces just whole brown almonds which is to say that these are not blanched blanching being the process that removes the actual skin of the almond not the husk and leaves a pale buff colored product and the description of lightly salted is accurate i can barely taste it the can says the ingredients are almonds vegetable oil canola safflower and or sunflower and salt that is it gluten free interestingly enough there is no indication on either the can or their website whether these are raw or roasted and i could not tell by eating them but blue diamond responded to my email query saying they are in fact oil roasted have to be pasteurized per a new california law you might want to know that this is a light roasting i would say that it goes part way to a roasted flavor remaining as healthy as possible while conforming to the legislation i mentioned my taste preference is actually for the flavor of a fully roasted almond bad me br br they taste fresh and almondy as they should they make a wonderful addition in both taste and appearance to my just created nonpareil trail mix which is lo carb and gluten free as i am trying even harder to follow this kind of diet i am pleased to report that these blue diamond almonds are properly dated on the bottom of the can it says best before jul that gives plenty of time to use up six little cans br br and about the cans they seem to be metal bottom and sides making them superior for storage although the plastic replaceable top with sealed metallic foil under it might be breachable by the ubiquitous rodent the little cans are nicely reusable,perfect little guys
11215,excellent flavor which we can find no where around us locally ate these as children and enjoyed them so much excellent light snack,smokehouse almonds
11216,i love all of the blue diamond almond flavors and they are my favorite snack this one is one of my favorite flavors and i eat these almonds for a snack because i view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods this flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt br br one serving of these nuts is calories and it contains grams of protein grams of carbohydrates grams of fiber and only gram of sugar and gram of saturated fat you also get calcium vitamin e and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body heart and bones i would rather eat of these almonds for calories than potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits br br this flavor has only of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food br br the only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away if you do not like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is the perfect one for you this is as good as it gets in snack foods and good for your body and diet br br i like all of the blue diamond almond products as i feel that they are healthier for you as long as you do not overdo it in eating them,one of my very favorite flavors
11217,these things taste great but the price on amazon swings wildly and widely so stock up when the prices is low,very tasty when the price is right
11218,these are perfect for traveling on the airplane when they offer you peanuts pretzels or cookies you can take out an alternate healthy snack the only thing is now i am addicted to them they are so good,tastes the best
11219,if you like snacks that are a healthier alternative to other options almonds are a great way to go these almonds are lightly salted and roasted they are absolutely delicious i could easily see getting in trouble with these since i could sit down and eat the whole can in a sitting and not even realize it i snack on them pretty much every morning to tide me over until lunch without having to eat a big meal or something very unhealthy for me,salted almonds
11220,these are the best smoked almonds i have ever had i remember getting these as a child on the airplane as a snack and have been searching for them for years finally found them and i will never eat any other smoked almond blue diamond almonds are forever,sweet memories
11221,great fresh product if you like roasted almonds no more frustrating attempt to buy some that match these in the grocery store free shipping and come to your home great for snacks,delicious perfectly salted and fresh
11222,the deal i got on these was amazing so that combined with the fact that i love this brand of almonds made ordering these no brainer i happen to love all of blue diamond different flavors for their almonds this flavor smokehouse is the best imo it is got just the right amount of smoky flavor to it without being overbearing i believe this is blue diamond best selling variety of almonds these come in ounce packages and for me each package is good for servings about a handful each serving very tasty,love these almonds
11223,i have tried a lot of almonds out there but i always seem to come back to these nicely sized can and a good deal here on amazon lasts me a while between purchases and saves me money too what can i say they are delicious,blue diamond only
11224,original review i thought i had purchased salt with almonds in it the amount of salt is ridiculous and very unhealthy almonds are a healthy snack but not if they are this salty br br update i contacted the company and they provided a replacement the new bag was perfect the almonds were tasty and not too salty it seems that i purchased a bag from a bad batch the company was prompt at correcting the problem i originally gave the product a star rating i am updating the review and giving the product stars,purchased a bag with way too much salt company provided a replacement almonds were perfect
11225,i love nuts of all kinds and eat some almonds and walnuts every day i have tried all the brands of almonds salted unsalted raw dry roasted spiced cocoa covered you name it these are by far the tastiest of all brands and types i have tried great texture a hint of salt just right the only problem with these is that they are so delicious its hard to stop eating them plus amazon beats the store price love them,the best tasting almonds lower sodium is just a bonus
11226,these are good though a bit too salty for my taste but you can get these for about less at any grocery store save your money,good almonds terrible price
11227,if you like an almond this is a good product and it is cheaper than the name brand to me this product taste the same as the name brand i like paying less and having the same taste,good taste
11228,its hard to stick to the rule of doing everything in moderation with these tasty snacks around salty smokey a wonderful and more nutritious alternative to potato chips good with cocktails good by the handful i have snacked on them before dinner watching tv having a drink or at bedtime and did i mention the price the pack is so much cheaper than buying singles at the grocerystore all round great snack,delicous salty snack
11229,i should have been more aware of the price at local stores for this product walgreens had these exact almonds for less per bag that week they are delicious though,over priced but tasty
11230,i need to watch my sodium but i am not really a fan of salty foods in the first place br br these almonds are perfect at half the salt i would prefer them over the regular salted almonds any day i have no idea why anyone would want to put more salt on these delicious nuts br br the three count ounce bags with prime shipping pop on and off of amazon buy them when they are available otherwise you must buy the six pack of small cans at a higher price per ounce,delicious blue diamond quality half the sodium
11231,what is not to like delicious smokehouse almonds in the perfect size package i keep them in my locker at the gym for a post workout snack they are very smokey don t leave an open package in your car like i did it made my car smell like cigarettes however this is unlikely to happen as it is hard to only eat part of the package as they are so good,tasty
11232,we like these almonds and were unable to get them at our local store anymore so found them on amazon and ordered them,good almonds
11233,i have tried several other brands of roasted salted almonds available via the internet and in stores the blue diamond brand is definitely the best tasting of all,best roasted almonds

11236,i love the portability and taste of this snack i wish the caloric and sodium count was less but the protein count is perfect,great snack
11237,smokehouse almonds are great but i just cannot take all of the salt so i rub some of the salt off of them and then i go to town if they sold lightly salted ones i would probably not only be addicted but broke as well from eating them so much love love love this product and will buy again,i love them after i rub some of the salt off
11238,great deal on these nuts whole family loves these nuts nuts for nuts arrived fresh and tasty great for a snack or packed in a lunch,deez nutz
11239,these almonds had an unbelievable amount of salt on them i love salt but this was over the top i have bought this brand from other stores and they have never been this salty maybe the machine went wacko when processing these br i cannot eat these unless i take the time to try and wipe off the salt which talks forever,too salty to eat
11240,but the cans were smaller than i expected for the price i paid i dunno i just expected to be saving a lot more than that when buying in bulk it is the same price about a can at the local target plus and this is a personal problem i had a hard time being conservative with em they are delicious not as good as the smoked ones though which amazon does not sell for some reason and i could not stop eating them i went through two cans in the first night i love to snack but almonds are not the best for snacking in large quantities and i will not explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system anyways the nuts are perfectly fine and it is a decent price considering you are not paying sales tax outside of ny and that there is free shipping if you are patient so i cannot not recommend them although i will never buy em again in this quantity,i love these almonds and all

11242,i bought blue diamond natural chocolate almonds before natural almonds it was good but this one made me feel sick i only eat for the day i dont know if it is the salt or something else with this but i have to throw this away i cant even move to workout im hoping i can sleep this off but i guess im the in million that this happens to,natural or chocolate covered for me
11243,purchased this item to try had to purchase the case i believe big bottles it was not what i expected but now i have big bottles to use i will share at work and with my family if i can get them to take some,soy sauce
11244,jablum jamaican coffee is jamaica itself especially the sandals resort at ocho rios if you ever make it to jamaica be sure to buy plenty of jablum in the airport duty free stores it is far less expensive but not necessarily fresher also make sure that the bean quality is not a problem with jarblum products but a concern with other jamaican blends offered in stores and on the internet thank heaven for the blue mountains the blum in jablum,the only thing better than
11245,i was not expecting this coffee to actually be shipped from jamaica so i was pleasantly surprised to find a fedex international package at my door one cannot argue that it did not come from jamaica i assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the us i guess that just proves what they say about assuming br br the coffee is real smooth and enjoyable unlike other jamaica grown products i tried during my youth this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma br br it comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside just like the picture it arrived fresh br br as with any of these boutique coffees you pay a premium like the hawaiian kona coffees so it is really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price,straight from jamaica
11246,i was not satisfied at first with this product after posting a less than glowing review i was immediately contacted by the seller distributor they graciously sent a new fresher bag of coffee this is much closer to what i remember try with sweetened condensed milk as suggested it is served that way in jamaica now if i only had some coco bread to go with it br br thank you for the prompt courteous service,conscientious seller
11247,this is the best coffee i have ever had and i may not be a coffee expert but i consider myself picky this is extremely smooth and flavorful i wish the price were lower we had to sign for our package that came directly from jamaica hey it is real but it is so worth the splurge,the best coffee ever
11248,since my first trip to jamaica i fell in love with the coffee the delivery date was right on and we had blue mountain coffee on christmas morning for a treat try drinking it with sweetened condensed milk,jamaican all the way
11249,i do not even like coffee but this is in a class by itself br br there is no bitter aftertaste and with the slightest sprinkle of chocolate creamer it is going quickly to become my drink of choice i cannot imagine how good it will taste with a shot of liquor in it br br i just wish we had more but we will soon thanks amazon br br no matter what jamaican coffee you buy make sure it is certified blue mountain jamaican coffee like this one is,i do not even like coffee but i love this
11250,i am a big juan valdez colombian fan this jamaican stuff does not have the kick that i love from coffee it is sorta flat especially for something i spent for two lbs goin back to colombian twang twang,so so
11251,when in jamaica i drink jbm coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean what i opened this morning was not what i had expected to be clear i was greatly dissapointed i found bits of husk from the bean which does not make coffee and is considered filler the flavor left something to be desired as well it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid i was hoping to leave a great review of this product but honesty forbids it,jablum leaves me nonplused
11252,believe it or not i bought this at a yard sale for cents the packaging was perfect and looked exactly like the photo it does not expire for another months i can only figure the seller received the coffee as a gift and had no idea the cost i love coffee and figured this would be very good but was so disappointed i wanted to see how much it would have cost me had i not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when i saw the going price on amazon there is no way on this earth i would pay the ridiculous amount here but i will say i like the coffee more now that i know what a great deal i got i decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer about over flowing teaspoons per cup i like sweet coffee i also used less coffee since last time i felt it was too strong i still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink jamaican coffee i too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places but not at this price needless to say unless i find another at a yard sale i will never drink this coffee again once my ounces is gone except if i take a trip to jamaica mon,nothing to write home about
11253,i bought this coffee after watching a documentary on jamaican blue mountain coffee thinking it would taste exceptional compared to regular coffee this was a gift for my boyfriend for christmas we brewed it in the drip coffee maker and also tried it in the french press and neither one of us were impressed at this point our preferred coffee is dunkin donuts original blend it much cheaper and more readily available,nothing special
11254,a co worker of mine went to jamaica for vacation in feb and bought me a lb bag of the ground it is expiration date was march i brewed it as soon as i got home to me it tasted like cheap coffee that had been left out in the open air for a week i wonder if it was due to the expiration date or does this coffee really taste like this if so i will never buy again from all the hype i was expecting much more,i did not like it
11255,its huge kilos taste is not a great as i remember but still good more strawberry taste than a lot of american jams i would buy again in other flavors too great for large families,english strawberry jam
11256,cannot miss with this when you really want to give something special product famous for quality delivered on schedule great practical packaging,a for steak lovers
11257,the steaks came well sealed and packaged and were delicious the price was right too for the size and quality of steaks that came i would recommend getting this product for the gourmet food lover in your life,excellent quality
11258,the steaks are real good for the price u cannot beat it the store you purchase this item from is very profesional i highly recomened this store,steaks r us
11259,i bought the top sirloin hoping to finally get a good steak at home br the first ones we cooked could hardly cut with a steak knife br the second time we tried them i tenderized for quite some time br they were more edible that way but still nothing better than i could have bought at the local grocery store br br except for the packaging there is nothing good i can say about these steaks br if you figure the price per pound these steaks should cut with a butter knife br br will never buy again,not worth the money
11260,i ordered a box of the omaha steaks top sirloins and it was like eating shoe leather toughest meat i have ever had there was absolutely no flavor to the steak and i did not want to waste it so i gave it to my dogs,like shoe leather
11261,great exactly as described arrived on time or at least as best as i can recall now must find another way to order this postage outrageous,freight postage outrageous
11262,i found these for the cost on the direct website with a free gift of lava cakes as well makes a great gift,buy from direct website
11263,hint pour on a bit of seafood sauce with horseradish in it and microwave a few seconds to warm up br br i just tried a can of these for breakfast this morning there were about ounces of actual sardine in there and the rest was sauce still not bad considering that is the equivalent of just over two cans of sardines for somewhere under three dollars if you buy them at a time br br the fish were not the freshest tasting i have had but they were not that bad either at least they are the medium size sardine fish and not the herring you find in the really cheap sardine cans br br here way to beat the recession and get your protein and calcium,not bad for sardines in bulk
11264,unfortunately i am completely disappointed with this product i have an above average sense of smell but this extract has hardly any detectable flavor in the bottle and none whatsoever once added to food perhaps i received part of a faulty batch the seller is letting me return the bottle but is requiring that i pay for shipping again so i would be very unlikely to order from them again,almost no detectable flavor
11265,lacks the flavor i was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level i will not be ordering this again live and learn,quite disappointing
11266,i used to use another product by another vendor but they were always running out and not replacing their product for quite a while i was glad i found this product as it is even better than the one i used to use i love it as a hawaiian i eat rice every day and i always sprinkle the nori komi on my hot steamed rice mmmmmm making me hungry i highly recommend this product also i received this product quickly and it was packed very well,great stuff
11267,this is so good in rice on sushi and miso soup br i am making miso soup all the time now just so i can use this,delish
11268,after gastric bypass surgery you have to eat or more grams of protein every day sugar free protein shakes give you most of it but you do like to get it from other sources also you have a very small cup stomach so you cannot waste your space on snacks that cannot benefit you with vitamins proteins or some nutrient of value also you cannot eat sugar but you can eat sugar substitutes so kay naturals products are great they have tons of protein and they taste great these cinnamon toast pretzel sticks are great the sweetener is low enough in the ingredient list to be able to tolerate it because there is not much of it the white cheddar kruncheeze snacks are great also they are like cheetos and you like to be able to have a snack when other people do also the thank you kays you help us take casre of ourselves while we enjoy food and make eating a little more normal lisa,protein in a snack means gastric bypass patients can enjoy with everyone else
11269,these pretzels have a good cinnamon taste and are really crunchy they are a satisfying good for you snack as you can nibble on them for quite a while also have no trans fats or artificial flavors will purchase again,good snack when dieting
11270,these are a tasty alternative to carb heavy regular pretzels i rely on kay naturals to help me in my high protein diet i would have these for breakfast every day if i could i am sad that i have to order them online however they should be available everywhere kids should be getting these in school vending machines instead of the evil crap that is now available these rock,awesome protein crunch
11271,i had already bought this product from another website before and i generally love it however the one i bought from this supplier tasted horrible and it also tasted like someone dropped ashes in it this comes with packages and i opened to make sure that it was not just a problem with the one package because this was so horrible i could not bring myself to try the rest so the rest of it will be going into the garbage,horrible
11272,these are not clearly labeled gluten free they say pretzel sticks and they do not resemble pretzel sticks very closely at all they are a weird flavor sort of costly and not worth it eew,blech
11273,you get bags for in each bag is about a handleful of pretzels the taste is ok but not worth a dollar a bag,not worth the money
11274,these pretzels have a nice crunch and a lot of nutritional value but their flavor is very bland bland with a hint of cinnamon i wish i would tried a single bag before buying an entire bag box but they are not available in stores at least where i live and the reviews seemed fairly positive on the bright side they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories a recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein dense snacking rather than flavor,nutritious but not so delicious
11275,the crunch is out of this world i always have to pre apologize to my office mates when i have these for lunch they do not mind but i do when they smack crunch too loud i digress br br these are one of my favorite items my kay they do not have an aftertaste maintain there crunch factor and are just plain good the sweetness is not overpowering and the protein content helps to fill me up br br they are a main staple as a treat and or lunch addition,the snack that i love
11276,bit size pretzel sticks are delicious small packages of these sweet and salty pretzels satisfy my cravings for foods i should not be eating they are made of nutricious ingredients that follow my weight reduction diet and can be used as one of my mini meals buying them in quantity for discount pricing is a great bonus,kay natural pretzel sticks cinnamon toast
11277,kay cinnamon pretzels have great crunch and just enough sweetness the protein carb balance is comparable to medifast i love being able to buy minnesota made,great taste great price
11278,love the kays naturals line gluten free and healthy totally delicious the cinnamon sticks are my favorite and the pizza flavored puffs for the savory treat amazing that grams of protein fits in this small serving my best find for healthy snack food,tasty treat
11279,i ordered boxes ea of the cinnamon pretzels i have had them before and knew i liked them not so concerned about gluten they sent me box of pretzels and boxes of cinnamon cookie bites i think the shipping department can do better,pretzels are good but that is not what they sent me
11280,these soy based pretzels are a little sweet and contain protein which makes them perfect for a mid afternoon snack they help cure the munchies and hold off the appetite until suppertime love them and keep a constant supply on hand,healthy tasty snack
11281,i am floored by the negative reviews i started eating these about months ago and am addicted this item is a blend between crunch and a bit of sweet yes they are a bit gritty but i never opt back to regular stick pretzels so that is not a real noticable issue for me i saw dr oz introducing new foods to some people one day and he reminded them to taste and evaluate on the item not as a comparision to what they were used too that may be why some folks do not like these i love these so much i am buying in bulk but i have changed my eating habits degrees so maybe that is why i love them i never go back to the old way i ate as comparision and have no lingering desires for the junk food flavor,i love these cinnamon toast pretzel sticks
11282,the label on the little bag says serving is calories but one serving is ounce the little single serving sized bag is ounces so there are calories in the bag this is sneaky no one is going to open their bag and measure out one ounce then save the other half ounce br br edited to add br i ordered these again because the price went down momentarily is now back up and the product is now changed although amazon still had it listed at ounce bags what i got is oz bags so now yes one bag is a serving but the nutrition facts do not add up to what was listed before now a bag has calories and g carbs another sneaky move you get less for the same price,alert these have changed smaller bags now you get less
11283,these are not real pretzel tasting pretzels but are ideal for those on hi protein low carb low fat diets because they come in one serving packages they automatically provide portion control i love cinnamon and i love crunchy foods so these do it for me as a snack or mini meal i have just ordered more and plan to continue,cinnamon yum
11284,this is a great low carb high protein snack calories for a gram oz package about like a small bag o chips from a vending machine they are tasty filling and best of all provide a real chrunch my wife and i are one of the popular low carb packaged diet plans that uses a lot of shakes and soups etc plan works great for me so far but both of us really miss the crunch of biting into something solid like chips or a taco shell well these pretzel sticks satisfy that craving and let us keep to the diet much better i will be ordering my second batch soon they are really that good,excellent snack for low carb diet great crunch
11285,i have heard people describe horrible food as tasting like cardboard before i never quite knew what they meant until now this really does taste like cardboard i do not think i could give these a way they are trash do not waste your money here is a better low carb sweet snack a href http www amazon com gp product b zt eq blue diamond almonds cinnamon brown sugar ounce jars pack of a,cardboard
11286,i try to follow a somewhat low carb diet and find that these pretzels fit the bill as far as satisfying my need for a carby crunch i really enjoy all of kay chips and pretzels but keep in mind that of course there will be textural and taste differences from the real thing,too good
11287,finding easy high protein low carb food is always a challenge and usually when you do find something it does not taste so great these are yummy i love them they are satisfying and for those of you who have done or are doing the medifast diet these have almost the exact same nutritional info as the medifast pretzels and are for a pack of while the medifast pretzels are for a box if seven these will be a regular item in my pantry now,love it
11288,that is what they taste like to me i gave them to a friend of mine who agreed they taste like french toast great high protein snack,french toast
11289,i really like the flavor and crunchiness of the cinnamon toast pretzel sticks and g of protein in a tasty convenient wheat and dairy free snack is great i was not so impressed with the butter flavor i think most of the reviewers that did not care for the sticks were referring to the butter flavor br br in response to another reviewer yes the package states that this product is made on the same production line as products containing soybeans dairy tree nuts and wheat that does not mean it is not gluten free it may or may not be an issue for you depending on just how sensitive you are,love the cinnamon toast flavor not the others
11290,the freshness is great during the initial crunch but once the chewing and swallowing takes place these pretzels are very earthy and grainey tasting i have several bags you can have for free,earthy
11291,great deal i have checked around and you have the best deal that i have found on the kay naturals pretzel sticks br these are a good source of protein crunch and great price br thanks muchly,fantastic
11292,since losing weight my snacks have become far and few with these i can have low calories and high protein i love the taste,great snack
11293,i have a yorkie who even after having her teeth cleaned at the vet use to have horrible breath and hair that matted very easily since changing her dog food she no longer has the horrid breath and her hair looks and feels fantastic i will definitely buy this repeatedly worth every penny to us,helps my dogs breath and hair
11294,really good truffle flavor used some in scrambled eggs this morning and just ate a dinner of angel hair pasta truffle oil and grated asiago cheese heaven at this rate i will be ordering this again next week,totally going to buy again
11295,this is the best truffle oil out there they infuse good olive oil beware of those who use cheap oils instead i keep buying this the seller ships quickly and packs well you can trust this delicious product,the best
11296,i purchased these for my wedding favors and they were a huge hit the candied almonds were not too sweet and the mint green color is gorgeous it was a whole lot cheaper to buy these on amazon,perfect for wedding favors and gorgeous color
11297,we needed more of these for wedding favors this was one of the best prices and we got them quick product was good thank you,great
11298,i have cats of whom live inside and is outside it is quite difficult to find one food that appeals to this myriad of tastes seems like someone has a no thank you are you kidding me not on your life or a plain yeech on any choice i see that looks just delightful but no i am the human momcat and my tastes are just not the same of those as the princes and princesses in my care br br but merrick grammys pot pie cat food has hit the rare airy quality of being one of the few foods that is eaten by everyone all the time each time it is served that is a heady rating there are only a couple of other foods which have reached that level at our house one is the white meat and chicken by pro plan a href http www amazon com gp product b odas m pro plan white meat chicken vegetable entree adult canned cat food in gravy a the second is salmon and chicken by tiki a href http www amazon com gp product b an jdk tiki cat consomme pack ounce can napili luau wild salmon and chicken in chicken a the third is tilapia by fancy feast a href http www amazon com gp product b opqddy fancy feast appetizers for cats steamed tilapia ounce tubs pack of a br br so of all the cat foods i buy only four are always eaten by everyone all the time and grammys pot pie is one of them so the kitters have asked me to try some other flavor by merrick i will try for their sake for them anything but i doubt a raging success some things always look great at the start but then do not make it to the all the time every time every one category br br but my guys give this stars and say thank you for reading what we think gabriella trinity wisdom mercy and yellow kitty it is a star meal for us and we think your kids will like it also so give it a try you know for their sake or however she says that we agree on this merrick,delighful says the group
11299,my cats who are different in almost every way totally agree on this food its healthy so i dont feel guilty spoiling them they slurp all the juices nom all the real meat chomp the nuggets and veggies and lick their lips forever after i am a huge fan of all merrick foods but the pot pie turducken thanksgiving dinner and california roll are my cats favorites,my cats favorite food
11300,miligrams of salt per serving is not a healthy amount yet the br other ingredients in this condensed soup make it so delicious even br a salt counter like myself finds it hard to resist this is not br a snack food it needs to be mixed with other preferably totally br salt free ingredients not only a soup can be made with this br condensed yumminess i have used it with salt free tuna and or br salmon instead of mayonaise and added bread crumbs for a br delicious tuna spread br br so enjoy this condensed soup just be aware of the absolutely br t r e m e n d o u s amount of dangerous sodium in it and drink br eat and cook with it accordingly br br br br note to campbell i realize that salt here is used as a preservative but vitamin e is also a good preservative perhaps br you could use less salt and more vitamin e to preserve your soups br i hope so and will be looking forward eagerly to the day when br you do thanks,s o y u m m y b u t s o m u c h s a l t
11301,i am stuck on this cans are better more lemon taste but them the price is sky high on the oz cans i switch to this,almost as good as the oz cans
11302,my year old son introduced us to this tea which is quite refreshing this powdered version has several virtues over the prepared version it is much less expensive it keeps much longer my son says the taste is equal to or better than the prepared version he makes it a bit stronger and i like being able to make it a little weaker and less sweet it mixes very easily with no powder remaining,delicious and convenient
11303,my husband loves this drink so we keep a pitcher of it in the fridge year round it is nice to be able to buy the quart size we mix it a little light scoops cup total per quarts of water,this is a great size qt
11304,i admit i am a coffee snob it is my one vice i fell in love with coffee when i went to venice i found a little coffee shop on the grand canal i knew that moment with its aromas and sights would be locked into my spirit as a rite of passage in a sense unfortunately back in the states i discovered another world most of the coffees here tasted like something that was scraped off the pavement at jiffy lube eventually after much research i found a couple of great brands bought my own espresso machine and we lived happily ever after br br one day i read an article on weaver it sounded good since i am a happy member of amazon prime i decided to give it a try it is amazing even the subtle caramel flavor and scent is rich and soothing it is like finding a new close friend to share those moments in the sun with br br let face it good coffee is like a good friend but great coffee is like a soul mate this is that coffee,try it once
11305,brew style french press espresso br smell nothing special here decent coffee smell with some earthiness no caramel notes no sweetness br taste mild earthy somewhat smokey dirty mouth feel finish is short br br i mostly brew with a french press but i tried it in my espresso maker just to see how it would fair the caffeine seemed very pronounced to me there was no sweetness to speak of it did have a very nice crema though br overall i wont be buying this again its nothing special,lot of stars but not worthy
11306,we are definately coffee addicts and have tried tons of different coffees out there on the internet over the years we go through a pound of coffee every days we have ordered from almost every specialty coffee place out there and alot of them were great ones but was always still looking for that certain taste and this one has it i am so happy we decided to try this coffee we are now monthly subscribers this is also the first review i have ever posted and i have bought quite a bit from amazon this coffee is great,best coffee ever
11307,on our summer vacation i made sure to big pounds of weavers organic coffee with us because we not only cannot live w out this excellent quality coffee but are always disappointed when we buy others at coffee stores vacation was a lot better w weavers on us,cannot leave home without it
11308,there is a reason the today show voted this coffee the best organic blend in america it really is the best i buy a lot of coffee and have tried all the mainstream brands like peets and trader joe varieties this is easily the best i have had consistent never bitter and it is fair trade organic too the organic french roast is also great,organic blend best
11309,i recently discovered buying coffee on amazon and have fallen in love with the convenience i decided to try this based on the rave reviews wish i would not have listened not nearly as good as i expected note that it does not taste bad it is just that it does not have much taste at all br br also disappointed in the packaging the companies seal on the coffee is a joke and the coffee was all over my amazon box when it showed up this could be another reason the coffee did not taste very fresh since it was not air tight will continue to search other coffees on amazon,not as good as reviews say
11310,my wife and i switched from peet to weavers about a year ago and we have never looked back the organic blend is our favorite such great flavor with incredible aroma too cannot wait until tomorrow morning when i get to brew another pot weavers is the best coffee kept secret around not for long i am sure,the best coffee on the planet
11311,weaver got it right with this one lot of body lots of depth very deep and rich in flavor and very earthy and rich in flavor yet very smooth i particularly appreciated it is caramel finish truly a fine cup of coffee one of the best,they got it right
11312,i have been drinking this coffee since i learned that it won a national televised competition for best tasting coffee in its category organic i cannot drink any other coffee now because all the others taste terrible compared to weavers try this grab a handful of whatever whole been coffee you drink in one hand hold a handful of weaver whole been coffee in the other look at the size of the beans now notice the texture and smell of the beans you do not even have to taste them to see that it is a high quality product br br i used to order this coffee directly from weaver website until i found it here on amazon i was worried that it would not be as fresh as the coffee ordered directly from weavers but amazon sells so much of it that it never sits around for long before being shipped out it also arrives much faster via amazon br br i cannot think of anything bad to say about it it is a little more expensive than standard coffee but not much after you taste it you will not mind the price br br god bless amazon ups and weavers,black gold
11313,i got this coffee based on the reviews and fair trade category my husband is a big coffee snob he used to roast his own beans and uses a burr grinder and french press only and we both enjoyed this coffee we live in europe and have been using lavazza qualita oro whole beans without complaint and i figured i would give these a try due to the reviews and origin the flavor is full bodied and rich with a chocolate depth to it that i really like when we ran out we went back to the lavazza and upon our first cup we immediately noticed the bitterness and lack of character and were sold on the weavers and i am now putting in my order,very good coffee
11314,i drink coffee black and this coffee goes down smooth br br strong enough yet not overpowering great caramel undertones works great anytime of the day br br my stomach is happy with it and everything comes out alright no seriously that is a huge plus,weaver coffee just right
11315,grind it right before you brew it and you will have the best cup of coffee possible if you use a permanent filter with a drip coffee machine you get the full flavor much like you would get from a french press bottom line its the best blend of coffee i have had on amazon,grind before brew
11316,i love weaver coffee this is one of the best gourmet coffee i have had i would recommend this coffee to any coffee lover out there,love this coffee
11317,my plan had been to order large bags to save a little money but i am so glad i ordered weavers you will notice when you open the bag how heavenly the strong sweet aroma is it does fill the room and it will waft into your bedroom all night if you grind and prepare it on a timer the night before i know you may think it a sin to grind early but that convenience does not curtail your pleasure with weaver the taste it is delightfully rich and full i cannot yet speak for consistency,perfect aroma and taste
11318,i bought this based on the other reviews and i have to say this coffee is the best i have ever had without any reservations i drink on average six to eight cups of coffee a day and i own a top of the line super automatic espresso machine so needless to say i have tried a lott of different brands and blends buy this you wont regret it,the best
11319,read the reviews and thought this coffee was stars received the coffee and proceeded to open the package what was not there was any aroma had to stick my nose inside the package to even smell if it was coffee caramel well i proceeded to brew a cup smelled like normal star coffee tasted like plain ole coffee nothing special just plain ole coffee,whats the fuss
11320,i fell for the hype and gave it a try i agree it has the caramel hints which i guess is just not for me because caramel is a tad salty and i loathe that briney taste at the back of my tongue when drinking coffee i am ok being very subtly reminded of dark chocolate but no other flavors appeal to me when it comes to coffee i am going back to my favorite cafe altura biodynamic organic french roast which is the closest i have found to the rich deep bold coffee i have had in paris i have also had good luck with the san francisco dark roast i used to find at costco other great dark roasts i have found include black swan woodinville wa and hailey coffee company hailey id,over hyped
11321,weavers coffee is what some refer to as the best coffee on earth once i had my first sip i was hooked for life this great coffee has a great taste and is far superior to pete coffee experiencing the magical taste of weavers coffee is unforgettable and will be the best decision you have ever made,spectacular coffee
11322,we ordered this after having and enjoying the blend for seemingly forever in order to have a decent our opinion cup we had to use times the amount of coffee that we need when using the blend,good coffee just not the best
11323,i found this coffee to be fairly good but by no means outstanding i did not detect any caramel finish in my opinion it cost far more than its worth,fairly good
11324,i am a coffee fanatic and drink it for the taste all natural from a french press i have tried many different kinds here on amazon and can say that weavers full bodied is truly the best with flavor that is not too bitter and not sour you do have to know how to make it right,the best
11325,this is no doubt a quality product it smells perfect it tastes perfect when brewed properly i am adding this coffee company to my subscribers list you will not be disappointed,makes an awesome pot off coffee
11326,tried this coffee while working an early morning job it was one of the best coffees i have ever tried the flavor is warm and strong and i left me wanting more than just one cup i go to starbucks all the time and i honestly thought this coffee was better definitely recommend,amazing coffee
11327,the first couple of bags were great really fresh smooth great taste i thought i would found the perfect coffee bean the next bags stale i canceled my order and went back to buying whole bean coffee from the supermarket you pay a little bit more but i have found that most of the time the supermarket coffee is fresher i prefer the taste of weaver but too many stale bags,no better than supermarket coffee
11328,camerons organic velvet moon is way better comparing the two products this product is not what it is hyped up to be,i have had better
11329,i agree with the majority of reviewers in stating that this is excellent coffee very rich but not overwhelming in the caramel flavor i was not familiar with the brand prior to finding this on sale but i know i will be ordering it again,excellent coffee
11330,i have tried many different coffees and have never experienced tasting such an excellent coffee like weaver organic blend whole bean coffee it is very full bodied and sweet there is no bitter after taste i highly recommend this coffee to anyone who loves a great cup of coffee,exceptional coffee
11331,an enjoyable cup of coffee tastes better to me through an aero press than a french press tasted better with some honey or sugar although i usually use none,smooth taste
11332,this coffee is great i ordered it as a christmas present with a new grinder and he went through a full bag of these beans in just a few short weeks and praised the quality repeatedly will definitely be purchasing again,wonderful wake up
11333,you owe it to yourself to try and buy this artisan coffee brewed by john weaver of peet coffee fame if you are going to bother drinking coffee why not go for the best not acidic or tart weaver coffee is the best tasting and most gratifying coffee you can buy be bold and different by shedding your old bad habits merey following the crowd seriously serve this boutique coffee to your friends and they will never go back to big name mediocre coffee drinks and neither will you this is a diamond in the rough of coffee beverages so do not wait any longer you will not be disappointed,stop drinking mediocre brews and buy weaver coffee and tea
11334,this is absolutely the best coffee in america anyone who makes the effort to try this coffee will be addicted i am a huge proponent of french press coffee and this stuff is by far the best that way it is beyond belief in drip as well try it and you will see what i mean,obliteration
11335,we have been trying different coffee through amazon and by far this is the best it has a wonderful taste definitely ordering this again,mmmmmmm
11336,my girlfriend can rarely have caffeine because of her heart but she cannot help but always have a little cup when i make a pot of weavers organic blend the french roast is worth a try but i must say my absolute favorite is the organic blend its taste is unchallenged by others,should not be missed
11337,its not that this coffee sucks its that it does not begin to measure up to all the hoopla br its well balanced but thats about it br even a little old tasting nothing special in the least br what sweet caramel finish br can t believe this is the same coffee the star reviews are about,huh
11338,woooowwww the organic blend is probably the best thing i have ever tasted when i opened the bag and the aroma filled the room everyone just freaked out br i would say the organic blend is the best and not just because nbc today show said so,rudy from la
11339,hmmm where to start it is a really really good cup of coffee it definitely deserves stars no doubt happy to drink it would be proud to serve it to my guests perhaps best called caramel finish not sweet caramel finish might need a little turbinado sugar to get the sweet part br br i do not think it is better than the cafe altura dark roast columbian sold by amazon in oz bags i would consider them equals but the weaver is not better and you get more coffe for less money with the cafe altura br br i m sure being called the best organic coffee on the nbc today show was a good shot in the arm for sales but i sincerely doubt that they are the new standard in artisan coffee i think of coffee like italian restaurants in new york new jersey the great ones have endured and everybody knows where to go for great italian food but when everybody is making the same stuff really well what you are left with is your personal preference weaver is lucky to have some devoted coffee drinkers but they are not a new standard by any stretch of the imagination way too many people growing roasting great coffee for that,it is good stuff but do not believe the hype
11340,this tea is an excellent herbal tea love the taste and it is not as weak as most herbal tea is i used to get it from the commissary on base but they stopped stocking it so i checked on amazon most wanted to sell by the case but anneeavon sold them in single packages and i swear it said and free shipping when ordered from this seller above the add to cart button i ordered last night and opened my e mail this afternoon to find they charged me shipping for each of the boxes i ordered and the estimated arrival time is a week away for that kind of money i would expect overnight for that kind of money i could have gotten a couple cases and had change it is probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products,buy this somewhere else not from anneeavon
11341,it is not an amazing tea it is an okay tea i buy regular green tea at asia market for way cheaper price and i get same result i look for saving money will not repurchase,will not repurchase
11342,great product at a awesome price i have been drinking this product from early may and the health benefit are great,great
11343,my dogs have been enjoying these treats for years and we have ordered this many times from amazon in the past however our last order was a big disappointment the description of exactly how much of this product you will receive is very unclear so when i saw that the product weight is lbs and the shipping weight is lbs naturally i expected to receive a minimum of three one pound bags as we have in the past not so amazon outrageously charged us for a single one pound bag of dried lamb lungs you would think i was buying caviar the treats were promptly packed back up and returned tsk tsk tsk amazon br br so stars for the product itself stars for amazon this time,amazon regular
11344,i ordered the merrick lamb lung treats on the advice of a dog agility friend who had great success with them my dog has been blowing her contacts in agility trials and my friend suggested using these special treats only when training the dog walk a frame table and see saw after just two training sessions my dog is once again racing to the contacts and sticking them my fingers are crossed that this behavior will carry over to the trials but with the help of a clicker and these apparently very appealing treats i am seeing renewed confidence and enthusiasm they are expensive but are a bargain compared to the wasted trial entry fees and travel costs i am also going to use them as i begin very basic obedience training with our new rescue dog,agility and obedience training treats
11345,best treats for anysize dog no matter how large or small we give these to our local humane society as well they dont have the option of purchasing such hi quality treats our pounder herding dog loves them and the small dogs think they are steaks nearly jump ft for a piece dry and greasless and break easily can put directlly into pocket without concerns of residue transfer my favorite and the dogs too,best treats
11346,i am the aunt to dogs and they visit me for sleepovers i always try to have treats they like and this was no exception they kept coming back for more,perfect
11347,dogs love them they are the perfect treat to put in the kennel with them when i have to leave,lamb filet squares
11348,these treats are the best for training whether its obedience or agility they were recommended to me from my dog trainer after learning she used them while conducting obedience training with my pups they can easily break down into smaller bite size pieces which is great for constantly rewarding good behavior without overindulging or making them chew during training they are also great treats to be used as a small snack for your dog i highly recommend them my dogs will listen to anything i say when i have these in my hand,amazing treats for obedience training and snacks
11349,my two dachshunds are nuts about these lamb lung treats and i must say that overall they are my favorite dog treats too because a one pound bag lasts a very long time and therefore is very economical the pieces are easy to break up into any size you need for training they are a natural lamb a href http www amazon com gp product b n ekk merrick lamb texas hold ems lb bag a product with a genuine aroma of roast lamb the dogs never get tired of them you can carry pieces in your pocket and they will not stink or fall apart but the dogs sure know they are there for my dogs they are the most motivating commercial treat i have found what is not to like,dogs say delicious
11350,my large corgi mix loves these they are great as treats and or crumbled and mixed in with his food found these to be much cheaper than at my local store,super treat product for dogs
11351,i have been giving these to my dogs for the past couple of years they love them even though it is a bit pricey the bag lasts a long time we have dogs spoiled dogs they get these treats as rewards for good behavior or really for just anything this bag lasts a couple of weeks merrick is an excellent company the dogs love them and really what else matters this was an excellent price will be ready to buy more soon,lamb treats the only treats for my dogs
11352,most dogs love these but our dog was less than pleased he is a tad persnickety it is a good product with few calories great for training purposes,lamb lungs
11353,the merrick lamb filet squares are the best treat i have found for my dogs all of my dogs love them they are hard to find on the shelf as they are so popular they are often sold out at the stores,amazing treat
11354,been looking for a treat for my rottie that she would like but would also help her reudce her out of control milkbone habit and be less caloric these fit the bill well my only complaint is that they sometimes arrive pretty broken up into small pieces however avoid purchasng from white dog bone very slow and poor customer service the provider seems to vary with amazon br br update tip from my vet frozen cauliflower has the crunchiness of milkbones that dogs love and few calories surpisingly my dog is quite satisfied but then she been eating asparagus carrots and green beans for dinner with roasted chicken msot nights for several years likes strawberries and peaches too she ll still get some milk bones and these texas hold em but if cauliflower can helpo her lose some weight we will push that more and its cheaper,my rottweiler loves these
11355,these crispy squares are lamb lung our older golden retriever does not care what they are he likes them so much he actually dances around when we get them out even the cat loves them and comes running for a few crumbs when we open the bag our dog is a somewhat picky eater so sometimes i shave bits of these treats over his dry dog food and he loves it,our dog favorite treat
11356,this was gross it lamb lund smelled bad there hard chips my dogs favorite is the texas taffy thats a winner i cut it into peices she loves them,lamb lung
11357,a friend of mine recommended these chocolate nibs and i love them they arrived promptly and undamaged and most importantly the price was great br,mmm mmm good
11358,what can i say if you love anise bears as much as i do then you understand why i buy several packages at a time i recommend you do the same,anise bears
11359,i used to buy this sugar for years i do not eat much sugar but still this sugar is called turbinado sugar but is misleading i picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar and other brands in the local food store that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something br br how did i find out i needed just a sweet water few days ago i put this sugar in the raw in the glass the water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just pure white sugar crystals what a shame on the producer u can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well br br i m just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice,fake colored crystals
11360,i order a vast quantity of this sugar about twice a year we use it on everything actually once you start using raw sugar white sugar falls short in the taste department,only sugar we use
11361,i love this sugar i have been using it packaged in envelopes for a year or two for everything gives a great homemade taste to cookies and packaged in envelopes see a href http www amazon com gp product b lkzk c sugar in the raw raw sugar ounce bags pack of a it is wonderful stuff br br but not in this packaging if you do not use the whole pounds right away the boxes of sugar turn hard as a rock have to microwave them pound them with a hammer and then pour the sugar into a plastic envelope with a sugar bear e g a href http www amazon com gp product b ukowfc jbk bear terra cotta brown sugar saver a to make it possible to use it definitely not worth it buy it packaged in bags or not at all,the product itself is great but not packaged this way
11362,i have always like sugar in the raw but it is usually too expensive amazon has this priced very reasonably and i have been buying it regularly i also try to avoid any food with hi fructose corn syrup and this sugar is what i like,great way to purchase sugar in the raw
11363,this is one of the best combination of flavors i keep thinking my family and i will get tired of having this on everything try it on every type of fish salad pot stickers and any tofu dish enjoy great delivery service by the way,try it
11364,a friend turned us on to earth and vine sake teriyaki marinade and i think we are addicted it is great on burgers but i mainly use it on steaks definitely the best teriyaki sauce i have ever used as it provides sweetness without overpowering the natural meat flavors helps the steak and burgers char up real nice too,we love this stuff
11365,i tried this special sauce on grilled salmon and grilled chicken it is simply awesome though not cheap and i cannot find anything better yummy br br rh br st louis mo,great marinade
11366,this is an excellent addition to sweet wines and champagne glasses especially if you are a newbie wine drinker trying to learn to love it this seals the deal sooooo good friends of mine that normally do not care for wine also loved this,yum love this
11367,while they are not my favorite fruits i do enjoy bananas and i keep them on hand because i love to add them to my smoothies i usually add a heaping teaspoon or two of matcha to all my smoothies too br br this matcha has a delicious banana y flavor that is not too sweet the sweetness is from the fruit flavor and the matcha itself but it does not taste candy sweet at least not to me although it does smell like banana candy when you first open the package and all the while during preparation but i do not get that sort of taste from the matcha and that is a good thing at least in my opinion br br the matcha does taste a little different with the banana flavoring the normal vegetative tones of the matcha meld with the flavor of the banana the fruity notes of the banana in such a way that the vegetal notes seem to disappear and become more fruity the lovely creamy buttery tones are still there and it still tastes like matcha but it is not veggie or grassy tasting like some matcha can taste br br i like,mmm banana
11368,this is one of those matcha that you will want to have around for the kids their friends and when you want to make smoothies or have a sweet treat its not my favorite from red leaf but its not bad at all it just reminds me of circus peanuts do you remember those things sort of like slightly hardened dried out marshmallow like candies we used to get them at the dime store remember when we had dime stores haha anyway i do enjoy this tea takes me back to the good ol days and really where they all that good oh well the point is this is some good stuff and i do like it but its more of a banana candy like flavor rather than fresh ripe banana but at the same time i just do not know how natural of a banana flavor one could possibly get i do not know if i have ever had a better banana flavor in a tea or anything else for that matter that was not a banana itself i think that banana flavored things always tend to have that slightly strange flavor to it br now this is where things get really good i mixed my banana matcha with macadamia nut matcha to make a banana nut like matcha and it was excellent made a smoothie out of it that way too it was quite yummy,do you remember circus peanuts
11369,we are lucky to have several great coffee roasters in the triangle area of nc counter culture carrboro coffee co joe van gogh and larry beans not to take anything away from the other guys they roast some wonderful coffee too but larry beans is the master of blending beans from different regions to come up with very drinkable delicious coffee wjat sets larry beans apart is that they are consistently less expensive than the other guys mentioned for this reason larry beans gets most of my business,larry beans is great coffee
11370,these are the best pumpkin pie bars ever impossible to find in my area so checked on amazon there they were we will have a very happy thanksgiving this year this is our dessert,krusteaz pumpkin pie bars
11371,krusteaz pumpkin pie bars are out of this world we first made them for a big party that we hosted and the guests just went nuts over them they were all gone before we even got a chance to try them so we had to make more to find out what all the hoopla was about well the guests were right and they are absolutely amazing we buy boxes at a time now usually from amazon since the local stores only stock it seasonally but it is definitely worth purchasing they are very easy to make and we love them right out of the oven but i think that they are even more amazing after being in the refrigerator overnight if you love pumpkin you must give this a try,pure heaven
11372,i made prunes a permanent part of my diet because a they are promoted as the best food source of antioxidants and b because they are very sweet and serve as a good sugar substitute for when you have sugar cravings they are also supposed to be good um um against constipation so be careful i usually eat a couple at a time and never more than four never a problem within these limits they are nice to add to oatmeal too along with bananas and raisins or instead of raisins raisins are also a good antioxidant in fact second best after prunes about half as strong br br i ve tried many kinds of prunes and so far sunsweet are the best i like their taste best consistency is good neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard they keep up well i do keep thim in the fridge but that is strictlyl speaking unnecessary they will be fine for a couple of weeks in the open and they taste better at room temperature and the product quality is consistent no surprises br br i buy them in stores where an oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks this page wants thirty well this must be some sort of error i expect an online price to be better not six to seven times what i can get locally so my bottomline is this sort of prunes is very good but pick them up at your local grocery store not here in fact i got them a few times on sale for like two seventy a piece in a local drugstore believe it or not be very careful with prices here first they jump around quite a bit and second if you subscribe and the price goes up they will just go ahead and charge you more w o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more avoid subscriptions cause yeah they will give you an extra discount and next month will jack up the price by it is a racket so stay clear br br ps just discovered trader joe carries pitted prunes too a resealable plastic bag holds one pound oz and costs two eighty nine that is about one tenth of what this guy above wants bemuzing to say the least,good prunes but what is with the price here error
11373,but i coulnd t get it delivered for xmas i was penalized because i did not proscratinate,great gift
11374,this line of hot sauces was found on every table during our trip to belize and i have looked at every supermarket i visit at home for marie sharp brand to no avail finally found it on amazon and ordered different types they came well packaged in a timely fashion and those in my household who use hot sauce at almost every meal are thrilled we live in an area with lots of hispanic markets and a sea of spicy sauces and foods available but not marie sharp it is wonderful heat with a little sweet made in and exported by the tiny country of belize i recommend you give it a try amazon usually has special deals when ordering several bottles at a time,some say this is the best hot sauce
11375,i loved the packs with the flavors except the chocolate covered they were horribly melted into one great big discolored glob figures with temps over in socal everyday during the summer i cannot blame anyone it is what it is,nuts great chocolate covered horribly melted
11376,these coffee beans are excellent got them within a week great considering they ship from costa rica they have the perfect chocolate to bean ratio,fantastic
11377,this tea is a nice change from my regular black tea i am not big on the taste of herbal teas so this was a good choice it is closer to black but has it is own special taste which i found myself looking forward to great in the evening as it does not contain caffeine,enjoyable
11378,if you have yet to try rooibos tea you are in for a treat this smooth delicious tea is excellent any time of the day i like that rooibos is naturally caffeine free so i can drink it late at night and not worry about staying up all night i used to drink rooibos when i lived in africa so this brings back fond memories what i like most about this tea besides the flavor is that this is organic and the company supports fair trade practices so you can really feel good about drinking a cup of tea from a company that is making the world a better place this tea is also rich in antioxidants and contains calcium some parents make this tea for their children when they have colic use it like water in baby formula it is a good natural remedy this tea does taste best with milk and i add stevia too although it is also served with lemon and honey br br the rebecca review,delicious
11379,these are tasty enough for an emergency snack lunch i keep a few in my file cabinet but our local meijer sells them for apiece even the discount price here is twice that,too expensive
11380,not sure i would call this a meal on the go the can of tuna salad is like the size of a can of fancy feast and you get ritz sized crackers do get me wrong the tuna salad itself is excellent creamy compared to the pouch style make your own stuff the carrots are a nice touch minimal packaging ready to eat and shelf stable i wish they carried them in the vending machine at work,tasty snack
11381,i saw these on sale at a local store and only bought one because i was not sure i would like them wrong they were great and i loved them could not wait to get more the portion could be small for some but for me it isn t and only calories for all of it i could not believe that the tuna salad is slightly sweet with some little veggie chunks in it really creamy too the can opens easy like a foil on top and the salad seems to match up to the crackers nicely i need to get more only have left i highly recommend these but i do know stuff like this is a taste preference but i am very happy,perfect light lunch
11382,i love this stuff i am currently deployed in afghanistan and working extremely long hours i keep these delicious little kits in the office and in my wall locker in my sleeping area they have saved me many times when i could not leave to get a complete meal in the dining facility love them,life saver
11383,we love trader joe just the clusters vanilla almond granola cereal but were very disappointed with the quantity we recived for the price charged as a result we returned same,too expensive
11384,even if you think you know italian dry mushrooms order these and find out how wrong you were unbelievably beautiful deeply fragrant terrific huge intact slices flip all the cards over these completely redefine the category not just for sauces soak a few to garnish your steak make a knockout appetizer with these porcini some stock and a shot of marsala to top it all the price is reasonable bravo,knock your socks off
11385,i have purchased many porcini mushrooms in grocery and gourmet stores these were the best quality flavor and shape the price was excellent as well i added some to a fresh mushroom soup i made and got an incredible depth of flavor have also used them in braised beef dishes,wonderful mushrooms
11386,i have been buying mushrooms from jr mushrooms for over a year now i have ordered maybe times service delivery and quality are always number i highly recommend this company and their products br trevor,phenomenal service and products
11387,i have purchased bags of dried porcini previously from a very expensive gourmet food purveyor in nyc i tried this product the price was a bit lower but the shipping was much lower the dried porcini are as good if not better than from the expensive place they arrived promptly and were packaged well i immediately put about a third of them into an airtight glass jar on my counter packaged the rest up in a doubled freezer bag and put them in the freezer they keep well for over a year the pieces are large sliced well clean and bright the aroma is beautiful tossed some into a pot of braised lamb shanks the day they arrived fabulous,great value great flavor
11388,these mushrooms are wonderful they taste rich and woodsy and add real complexity to soups stews or anyplace you would use fresh mushrooms br br dried mushrooms do not weigh much so you will find your order may be larger than you expect the supplier recommends that you store them in the refrigerator or freezer br br shipping was amazing i ordered them on friday and received them on monday standard shipping the package started in massachusetts and arrived in seattle in four days very happy with that,great mushrooms
11389,when i bought these mushrooms before they were clearly labled from italy this time the origin is not mentioned on the bag and when i checked their website i see they have written a bunch of malarky about how porcinis taste the same wherever they are from even from north america or china that is just not true porcini from europe taste better the terroir changes the mushroom flavor considerably just as it changes the flavor of grapes made into wine since jr mushrooms refuses to reveal their country of origin i must assume they are selling cheaper possibly contaminated mushrooms from china in order to make a bigger profit beware buy another brand,not italian or french
11390,excellent rich flavor and the mushrooms were freshly dried based on the spores under a microscope were these percent boletus edulis br rick,boletus edulis
11391,i was not able to find these mushrooms in any nearby stores so i decided to order on line through amazon the product came very quickly and although oz does not seem like much my recipe called for only oz so this pack will go a long way once reconstituted and added to my pot roast they were delicious they made the sauce really tasty and earthy my family loved them i will use them in stews and soups in the future well worth ordering at amazon great service great product,porcini mushrooms grade super premium aa oz
11392,these were fair i do not feel they are aa quality would not repurchase,okay tasted better
11393,i went for these when i got a free bucks to spend with a new amazon credit card and im glad i did not pay full price br br i was in the process of creating an authentic bolognese meat sauce and i wanted some very hearty mushrooms to add a bit of oomph to the sauce which is meat and onion heavy and i figured from the reviews that these are a meaty tasting mushroom i also see the price asked for these at our local giant eagle grocery stores so yeah i did get a bargain from their rip off pricing but these are basically taking up freezer space br br i ordered two grades a higher grade with bigger shroom pieces less stems etc and in retrospect should have just ordered the scraps or even the dust as i found the big pieces stayed a nasty tough chewy texture even after hours of cooking i also extracted just juice from the mushrooms but the broth was not strong enough to bother i basically just chop these in the food processor and add a lot of them to get a change in flavor in recipes the one ounce bags do not even bother with because it takes a lot to get some flavor from them br br in all honesty i have not used another poricini product so i cannot compare but i am disappointed with the results i got from these it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to for some one with a very tender palate but not for me and in no case are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe,expensive mushrooms ehhh
11394,one of my most favorite things to eat is a soft pretzel i enjoy going to the movies just so i can eat a soft pretzel these soft pretzels are awesome i will definitely order more in the future,amazing soft pretzels
11395,there are no pretzels that compare br i like putting salt on them and putting them in the toaster until crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle sometimes i will have them with mustard but that is not even needed because they taste so good,best pretzels ever
11396,purchased for lemonade diet and it was more than enough for me and my wife while on the cleanse for days excellent deal for the price paid,enough cayenne pepper for a lifetime
11397,it is the same spice that you buy in smaller quantities so it is just as good for a much better price,good buy
11398,this has got to be one of the best holiday coffee available i am so hooked but now cannot locate it anywhere if anyone has the chance to try this you will love it so definatly buy it while you can,awesome
11399,i enjoy the flavor of this very delicious soft peach candy it has definitely become one of my all time favorite candies the other flavors that this seller makes are also good but the peach flavor ranks in my book,very delicious
11400,i just put this candy out two days ago and half the tub is already gone in a small office the candy is very fresh and soft but not too soft a mild lemon flavor not overpowering at all each piece is individually wrapped and arrived unbroken and perfect i would recommend this for anyone and best of all made in the usa,everyone in the office likes it
11401,not blenheims the gold standard in apricots but i have had far worse than these the fruits are pleasantly tart sweet and have good nutritional value vitamin a compared to canned peaches which are still a favorite one or two cans were delivered with a small dent but the apricots themselves are unblemished i am sorry the other reviewer seems to have had such a bad experience but i can honestly say that mine were not salty and the can indicates that no salt has been added perhaps it was the potassium in the skins but i think they help intensify the apricot flavors of the pear juice in short these are all natural i e no added sugar or corn syrup which is a plus for me a good item to have on hand for quick healthy desserts either plain or with a sprinkling of granola and a scoop of a fav sorbet sherbet ice cream,good fruit
11402,i was looking for the old fashion in heavy syrup apricots but this as close as i have found i just add a quarter cup of sugar and cool or freeze it and enjoy yum,libby unpeeled apricot halves in pear juice concentrate
11403,i almost did not order these because of the bad review only one can was really dented and i opened that first no damage at all to the contents and the flavor was not salty the apricots are tangy the skin is a bit leathery just like fresh apricots and the cans are quite full not just juice with a few fruits floating around i was very happy with the product and would order again these are delicious for a quick dessert right out of the fridge but would make a nice cobbler too,refreshing delicious
11404,these apricots are just great they are full of flavor but not too sweet there are about to halves to a can br br there was a problem with some severely dented cans but as usual amazon made it right,apricots
11405,if you are looking for a pick me up these apricot halves br by libby are so refreshing the apricots must have been picked and canned at exactly the right time the texture is great they are so tasty and they are not heavy on your tummy they are one of my favorite items to snack on at night,libby aprocot halves in pear juice
11406,this product is a waste of money it is bitter bitter and salty salty save your money and by the peaches instead a href http www amazon com gp product b pyn libby unpeeled apricot halves in pear juice from concentrate ounce cans pack of a,yuck
11407,this mustard is called brown but it is identical to what other company label as black good quality delivered in small bags,also know as black mustard
11408,i can no longer buy this in my area so was thrilled to find it on amazon it is one of my favorite breath mints which i keep in various places around my home as well as in both of my cars,great breath enhancer
11409,upon opening the package i thought that the tea had absolutely no aroma and looked old as if it was sitting somewhere in an open container for months after brewing it revealed a bland taste at best it was like drinking brewed hay i checked the expiration date which is two years from now maybe i had a bad batch but it is going back i had a better experience with rishi organic jasmine pearl loose leaf tea i do not recommend this tea to anyone,inferior
11410,very good gum flavor does not last a long time but i still love it the peppermint is my favorite,love this gum
11411,in order for tea to be labeled decaff is must be under caffeine when residue levels are tested a tea at caffeine is not decaff non decaff tea is anywhere between caffeine so at caffeine this is a caffeinated tea with caffeine slightly less than what is naturally present in the tea leaf,caffeine is not decaff
11412,first impression the friendly folks over at exclusively dog heard about my website and sent me of their products to test br let me just start off by saying that i love how sweet all of these treats taste dad was is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies plus the ingredients are very straight forward they are probably healthier than most the stuff mom eats but there in lies the problem dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age the second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar as we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar and just like humans can develop diabetes br br conclusion your puppy is nearly guaranteed to love the taste however these should only be used as an occasional treat if you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day they would soon plump up if you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly you may want to think twice on the pro side they are all natural with no animal bi products out of paws because dad made me if we were judging on taste alone they would be a,out of paws

11423,unfortunately all package size descriptions on the product page are wrong these are not oz packages and they are also not oz packages as stated further down in the description they are oz packages very disappointed in this fact cherryheads are tasty though and the shipping was fast,misleading
11424,these are from china and nowhere as good as those from italy spend the extra money and get those from italy,not the best
11425,i am happy with my purchase the mushrooms are mostly whole and have a quality shroomy smell to them not old and dusty in other words,good quality flavor
11426,excellent size and not too many are broken but they may be raw not roasted so beware would be nice if the merchant was more explicit or offered options br br i bought these for my wife who is somewhat salt intolerant so would buy again if they were prepared or presented properly br br update contacted the vendor who apparently has a problem with english and does the run around game so beware,pretty good but
11427,the nuts arrived very quickly with reg shipping they came adequately packaged in lb thick clear double plastic bags there is no oily residue left on my fingers after handling these nuts thus i say they are dry roasted or well toasted actually too well for my taste as some have pronounced burned taste to them since there re very similar cashew offerings here on amazon that state roasted i was naively wishing for these to be un roasted still these are much less expensive less burned than those in grocery stores not covered in sugar salt oil etc,to me these are well toasted or dry roasted
11428,i did not actually order these but wrote to the seller he replied that these are indeed roasted not raw br br the raw ones cost a bit more about shipping for pounds at the time of writing or you can get the raw which are a large size at pounds for shipping both are still fairly reasonable,apparently these are roasted
11429,this cake mix can not be beat for making muffins i have purchased this locally for years and the resturant supply who carried it discontinued it i tried several different recipes and cake mixes nothing compared to ghiradelli so glad i can still get it online ar amazon wonderful stuff,the best for muffins
11430,amazon pirated my personal image for their listing it is not a stock image i created it and put my website name on it looneystuff com for use on my website i have asked them to take my image down from this listing,amazon pirated my personal photo for their listing
11431,while the flavor of jolt blue has changed due to the change to corn syrup from sugar back in the day it is still pretty much the same thing that it always was it is still tasty and where else are you going to get blue raspberry soda and it still packs the same caffeine punch that it always did tasty and in the classic bottles what more could i ask for,jolt blue again at long last
11432,i love jolt and can remember when i use to be able to get it at just about every gas station but now its harder to find so happy when i found it on amazon and its still awesome as always cannot wait until they get more in stock,love it
11433,purchased this in hopes of flavoring coffee without sweetening it i did not find the flavor to be all that amazing but it was ok if you made coffee with it then asked me to guess the flavor i wouldnt be able to maybe because i know its supposed to be macadamia nut that im looking for the flavor and can find it in the end i am still trying to find good macadamia nut flavor,just ok in flavor
11434,great product exactly as expected actually arrived in plastic containers not the bags as shown a definite and appreciated upgrade,excellent
11435,this pecan meal is more like bran flakes than pecans i had thought it was ground pecans and the name would indicate that the container it came in is very light which was my first clue it was not exactly the whole pecan nut meat the meal is flaky the price might have been a clue i suppose since the per pound price of pecans is over most places,not what it seems
11436,fresh in the barrel and that is the way they stay the screw top lid keeps them as fresh as the day they arrived a very hearty pretzle not as thin as pretzel sticks but not as thick as a pretzel rod just the right in between fresh tasting and not too much salt br br unless you are having a party one barrel will go a long way i bought two barrels to save and ended up sending one baarrel to my company office really a lot of pretzels for the money will buy them again,yum yum
11437,these are good pretzels but as another reviewer mentioned they can get broken during the shipping process br br so you end up with some of them being broken into pieces br br jeff marzano br br mccann steel cut oatmeal traditional ounce tins pack of br br a href http www amazon com gp product b lkzk c sugar in the raw raw sugar ounce bags pack of a,good but some get broken
11438,the pretzels are really good buti think the box of pretzels could be packed alittle better or the carrier who delivers could be more careful many of the pretzel rods were broken in half with some in small pieces br the two plastic barrels wre partially crushed,crushed box
11439,this is something i was looking for the office they were affordable and great taste they arrive on time too,happy
11440,we purchased the pretzels to make chocolate covered wedding favors for our guests the pretzels would not have been bad for anything else but there were way too many broken ones we would have had to buy five more barrels my only complaint now is that we shipped them back over a month ago and still have not received our refund,wedding pretzels
11441,my absolute favorite very cherry indeed this is the only jelly bean i enjoy guess i will have to order more thay lasted no time with the grandkids lol,mmmmm
11442,i love mexican food and taco kits taco bell brand soft tacos is one of my favorite ones if not my favorite taco kit you may not exactly save when subscribing i usually buy these when they are on sale for but you do get them quick and easy every month br the kit comes with soft tortilla taco shells the seasoning mix and taco sauce br i want to buy a little container of extra seasoning because sometimes i use too much meat or my meat seems like it can use a little more flavoring especially when using turkey br otherwise i love this kit and i am very happy i subscribed,awesome
11443,by far the best home taco kit you can get i tried all the other ones you can find in local stores and not only is this one better i do not like the other ones it is a combination of the mix shells having a strange taste to them most local grocery stores do not seem to be carrying this anymore so i have them delivered every months automatically depending on how often we go through them taco night is one of my year old son favorite nights as he gets to make his own taco,best home taco mix
11444,these are good i made the hamburger sauce up and froze it in three parts i only use part at a time when i am really hungry and too lazy to cook they are good,easy taco night
11445,taco bell scores on this one the flour tortillas are not too thin and not too thick just right makes it easy to put a meal on the table really fast,these are great and convenient
11446,i grew up eating pancakes with real maple syrup and the fake hfcs based syrup just does not compare maple syrup is just wonderful with breakfast or as a sweetener in cooking i had never had grade b maple syrup but recently decided to try it because it is a few dollars cheaper turns out i love it just as much if not more than the grade a syrup i was used to it is not graded by quality like some foods but rather by the color grade b is darker and has a stronger flavor if you like one you will like the other and you will like this anderson maple syrup with amazon subscribe and save it is a much better deal than buying at my grocery store,delicious
11447,i ordered this back in october through subscribe and save and it arrived promptly and in good shape i then wrapped it up and two months later drove it nine hours north to wisconsin as part of a christmas gift basket for my parents in waukesha not having noticed that it is actually made by a family owned business further north in this state not only was this a good price for pure maple syrup grade b with strong maple flavor that goes a long way on a stack of pancakes but it was a nice surprise to find that wisconsin maple syrup is just as flavorful as that from new england,good strong wisconsin maple syrup
11448,i purchased bob red mill grain pancake waffle mix and gosh dernit a small waffle iron i prefer a stronger maple syrup and this is a great buy from anderson if you do not see any reviews in the next couple of weeks it will be due to sticky maple syrup fingers and possible carb overload,me oh my oh
11449,i have heard that some grade b maple syrups are too strong maybe so but this stuff is excellent this is the second quart we have received and the flavour is perfect a bit stronger than grade a but sweet and very pleasant to my taste br br personal taste note i also like my honey straight from the hive and unfiltered honey is sometimes a bit stronger as well as it has bits of pollen and comb mixed in that being said i have friends who are more finicky and they like this batch of syrup as well,good flavour very nice
11450,it is not vermont maple syrup i am originally from upstate ny and grew up with br the vermont maple syrup and i am used to it this syrup lacks that little tang for lack of a better word that the vermont syrup has it does come in second tho,this is a good syrup but
11451,i had been buying trader joe grade b for about the same price tj is kind of a drive so i used the prime and this is far superior used alton brown recipe for buttermilk pancakes from scratch added blueberries and this syrup capped off a great breakfast,good rich flavor
11452,being a hard core all things from vermont are the best kind of guy i was a bit apprehensive about buying maple syrup from wisconsin but the low price and a visit to their fantastic user friendly website sold me and boy was i glad i purchased andersons grade b my favorite grade through amazon annd found it to be by far the best tasting grade b i have ever tasted uniqley hardy yet not too molasses like this syrup hits all the right notes i will continue to buy this syrup to satisy my grade b obession and highly reccomend it to all,andersons grade b pure maple syrup
11453,i have had quite a few different grade b maple syrups over the years and this brand is my favorite rich maple flavor and nice thick texture love this syrup on buckwheat waffles and pancakes highly recommended,excellent syrup
11454,there is nothing like real maple syrup grade b is the highest quality syrup will definately order this product again price is good too for this quality,yum
11455,we just tried the wonderful maple syrup we love it thanks to andersons and hope they keep up the good work just ordered another one excellent,lots of flavor
11456,we converted to grade b maple syrup about a year and half ago we have tried several different brands and they have all been good this is by far our favorite the flavor is excellent and it is always a joy to open the bottle and pour out this delicious treat works great on pancakes waffles french toast as well as in cookies baked goods and sauces my favorite part of the glaze i use on smoked ribs mmmmmmmmmmm amazon has an amazing price on an amazing product this is our rd bottle of anderson grade b and we will continue to purchase it as along as it is available,excellent
11457,i have tried a few different maple syrups but this is absolutely the best i have tried br br first off grade b has a much more delicious maple flavor than grade a without being overpowering this brand is not as thick as most syrups but it is a quality i happen to love it is way less sticky and you can easily get out every last drop from the jug without having to set it upside down or breaking out a knife to scrape the jug br br i love adding a spoonful into some almond or soy milk for a touch of sweetness mixing in with some peanut butter try it it is delicious or making the best tasting lemonade on earth br br even if you are not on the master cleanse or do not feel it is necessary healthy you should still try the lemonade just to drink it is way better than any refined sugar lemonade i have ever had two tablespoons each of both grade b syrup and fresh lemon juice with oz of water is the most amazingly refreshing beverage you can imagine br br my only complaint is i keep finding so many new uses for it that i have been going threw a jug every week,pure sugary heaven
11458,i buy it over and again and keep it on hand because i have never had any maple syrup that is any better for the price and even spending a lot more money has never delivered me any better product,buy it
11459,anderson pure maple syrup is wonderful so thick and oh so delicious the only problem is that i did the super savers deal and than they did not have enough kinda frusterating b c i really do love this syrup,yummy
11460,i am willing to buy every time i run out br br also found it cheaper in a store so will not purchase online anymore,i love maple
11461,every bit as good as the vermont maple syrups in my opinion as you may know grade b maple syrup has a stronger flavor than grade a and i prefer the grade b version br br looks like amazon out of stock as of this writing hopefully they will get more soon because it is quite good and also was well priced,yum
11462,i like the syrup what more can i say i like it i like it i like it i like it,maple syrup
11463,tasty syrup but i was walking the aisle at my local superstore and found the exact same product for less and i do not live anywhere near vermont ah well its still great stuff and my pancakes thank me,tasty maple syrup
11464,delicious and the best price i could find no more buying the syrup at stores for half the size and the same price,yum
11465,i do not know if they use less salt or not but all i can say is these olives were a pleasant surprise the first time i bought them in a store they have a wonderful buttery ripe olive flavor and do not seem quite as salty as most olives do i wish these were easier to find at the grocery store or that amazon would carry this as a subscribe save item so the shipping would not be so high i cannot imagine paying twice as much for shipping as the cost for one can of olives they do not weight that much,unique buttery flavor with less salt
11466,i tried ordering these from amazon for the first time i worried that getting cans at once was a little over the top but my family of three consumed them within two weeks these have a great flavor and are a great snack i will order them again and again,great taste
11467,i love ripe green olives but do not often buy them because i cannot eat less than a can at a time br br lindsay olives are what they are very distinct from typical american stuffed queen olives no vinegar only slightly salty with a mild nutty flavor to me they most closely resemble ripe black olives but milder br br if you like olives but are on a low salt diet and perhaps mostly use them in salads or even sliced on pizza lindsay olives are terrific as is the price for a delicious spread microwave cream cheese for about minute in a oz glass bowl such as a href http www amazon com gp product b mzpii marinex ounce small round casserole with lid a to soften it then mix in coarsely chopped lindsay green ripe olives to make a dip add a tablespoon of milk and mix br br for snacking or as a light meal with cheese and fruit lindsay pitted ripe green olvies are a faint shadow of the truly wonderful genre of california ripe green olives unfortunately the only brand you are likely to find outside california is grabers olives a href http www amazon com gp product b p hpci graber olives size oz can a grabers are the rolls royce of ripe green olives and are priced accordingly about per olive including shipping to the east coast perhaps per olive if you buy them by the case directly from grabers what is the difference bigger better olives to begin with pits and careful processing the pits make a huge difference in any olive they impart a nutty flavor to the flesh in the case of grabers the flaver is nutty and buttery if you want to impress your guests at a buffet serve grabers and go for the big size olives they will cost you about each i e per olive but are worth it unfortunately lindsay does not sell unpitted olives br br i also recommend a href http www amazon com gp product b fakup byzantine fresh olive antipasto pound bag a and a href http www amazon com gp product b fair byzantine pitted country olive mix pound bag a both are nice mixes of unpitted olives without hot peppers or other excessive flavoring,it is a matter of taste
11468,these are the best green olives on the planet i buy cases of these they are well over at some stores i get them here when they are avail,please keep in stock best olives on the planet
11469,these are wonderful and the previous reviewer put it perfectly br these are a delicate tender buttery flavor olive the one br grocer in our area just quit carrying these with no hope in br sight of ever ordering them again br then found out we can not even get them in our state br br bummer that amazon does not carry them,best ripe olive i have ever had
11470,at for ounces no wonder one cannot pull up the bag to see details br like per pound,a little pricy no details on bag
11471,my wife had some coffee at the cafe d arte coffee shop when visiting her mother last year she raved about it so much that i contacted their web site to sample some it was great some friends who own a local restaurant which prides itself on its good coffee agreed that it was the best they ever had i reordered several times before deciding to look up the price on amazon br short version same coffee much better price,best coffee ever
11472,this gluten free starch is used to thicken soups and gravies its main advantage over other starch thickeners is that it is a permitted ingredient for passover unlike cornstarch and other grain based foods liquids thickened with potato starch should never be boiled supermarkets often stock it among the kosher products i have used this in cakes and in some gentle sauces there is no taste that comes from this so just the flavor of the ingredients comes through it is very silky and fine remember you do not want to let your sauce boil with this starch those who are on a gluten free diet may be able to use this,alternative thickner gluten free
11473,what can i say about potato starch it is just potato starch so this review will be on barry farm instead of potato starch br br from barry farm you are going to get things cheaper much cheaper i have been buying products from barry farm for several years and they have been great to deal with their shipping is fair but unfortunately flours and starches weigh a lot and shipping is not cheap i purchase items from them that are too expensive to buy locally things i cannot find locally finely ground white corn flour sweet rice flour and ivory teff and items that are better quality than what i can buy locally the best sorghum flour anywhere i usually order or pounds of product at a time and that reduces the overall price per pound to a reasonable cost,potato starch
11474,a recipe in cooking light recommended that potato starch be added to cupcakes cakes etc when you reduce the amount of butter it worked well and i would recommend this company they had a fast ship and well packaged,great replacement for fat in cupcakes and other sweets
11475,i was thinking lb would be a lot more than what it actually came out to be especially since starch is somewhat light and since it was i wish they sold this in larger quantities,good company and quality small and expensive bag
11476,learning to cook gluten free is difficult i especially like bread and have been experimenting with this product to mix a flour that is like my mother so far it is an experiment but i could not do without it,gluten free all purpose flour ingredient
11477,they may have great products but shipping is incredibly slow shipped days after i placed the order not yet received and the shipping price is unreasonable,barry farms
11478,i was not able to find potato starch in my local stores i went to specialty cake decorating stores and was told that this product could be found in the regular super markets not the case i came across this cake recipe which called for the potato starch and i wanted to use the ingredients stated i was so happpy when i found the product in small and large quantities this is a web site that i will definitely book mark the end product was a beautiful looking and great tasting cake,happy to find a source for potato starch
11479,we used to buy this pasta regularly at our local supermarkets but a few years ago it just vanished we were very glad to stumble upon it on amazon and the transaction was as usual perfectly fine,a fave
11480,discovered this pasta years ago in canada love it but so hard to find consistently in us stores br br this is the second time that i have bought from this seller excellent service from start to receipt,darn good pasta and fantastic customer service
11481,great to send to my son a college student easy to fix and very tasty,excellent
11482,i love this product and i wish it was easier to find in the stores for some reason i can never find it our local stores will order it but they will not call and let you know it came in by the time i get there it is already all been sold br br this is a great side dish with a piece of chicken or a green salad i love it with vine ripened tomatoes but my favorite way is to substitute del monte brand italian style stewed tomatoes it amps up the spicy factor by quite a lot but it is not hot spicy just very flavorful try it this way during the winter months when decent tomatoes cannot be found,my all time fave boxed pasta dish
11483,this is a great way to trick children into drinking juice it is organic flavorful and the berries give the tea a red pink purple color no more food coloring artificial flavors or sweeteners everything i could have asked for even the packaging is green it is printed with soy ink this is a company you should be proud to support the only way it could be better is if it was made in my home town so it would take less energy to get it into my tummy it is absolutely refreshing and nourishing,delicious and refreshing and green
11484,dont be fooled this is not a health cereal br the second ingredient is sugar and this cereal also has fructose in it i feel like i am eating kid cereal it would be healthy if it had less sugar in it carb conscious people and diabetics beware,too sweet
11485,that says it all this is the most wonderful way to get fiber i use it as a snack as opposed to cookies or chips i nver use milk just cup in a bowl and a slowly munch one square at a time it works for my weight watchers plan a great way to get fiber and soothe the cookie monseter in a healthy fashion,i bought boxes what does that tell you
11486,this cereal is so tasty it seems like you are eating one of those not good for you sugary cereals that kids love they are very similar to cinnamon toast crunch they do have a slight healthy taste but it is hardly noticable even the kid will enjoy this cereal which has an amazing amount of fiber in it especially to taste so good not like sticks i used to eat raisin bran b c it had g of fiber and still tasted okay now i eat this which has g of fiber and tastes awesome br i highly recommend it oh and the squares are small about the size of ctcrunch so it is the perfect size for toddlers to pick up and eat they will think they are eating candy but you will know it is good for them,like eating kid cereal
11487,i frequently buy post shredded wheat and decided to try this new cereal because it is made of whole grain wheat my teenage children had the same opinion about caramel delight that i did they liked it as an occasional high fiber snack but it is way too sweet as a cereal general mills should reduce the sugar and instead increase the insoluble fiber in this cereal that would make it perfect,way too sweet for a cereal but great as high fiber snack
11488,really tasty cereal amazing packaging way to go amazon the boxes were in better shape than at the store sometimes the cereal seems a bit too sweet it is nice that i can get so much fiber from this but one has to be careful not to eat too much haha,really tasty
11489,i was a skeptic about this product until i tried it with skim milk this cereal is delicious and retains its crunch even after minutes of being soaked in milk i enjoy its texture and caramelly flavor i think it could definitely be less sweet and lower carb but so far i find this cereal to have the highest fiber content the other vitamins and minerals a single serving contains is also comparable to similar products by other companies this is perfect for breakfast or a snack any time of the day,a little too sweet but still delicious and great for gi health
11490,finally a high fiber cereal that tastes great i like mixing the carmel with either the honey cluster or the raison cluster for an even higher fiber load and the lowest price i have found these cereals in on amazon com we all love saving money while being healthy right try it for days and i am sure you will love it like i do thanks and have a healthy day br mike buckley br concord ca,awesome
11491,this cereal makes getting your fiber easier but it does not taste as good as the other products in the same line i was expecting caramel delight to have a powerful caramel flavor but found it lacking it is not that the cereal is inedible it tastes fine but the flavor gets a little lost once you add milk it is like you are eating healthy cereal the clusters options make it much easier to feel like you are indulging and taste much better just be warned do not eat too much do not snack on it like it is popcorn it is got fiber even if you cannot taste it and your body will let you know when you have had too much,my least favorite of the fiberone options
11492,love love love this cereal it tastes like a caramel version of cinnamon toast crunch all fiber one products are great not like other fiber products that taste like cardboard get your daily fiber with a product that is actually delicious highly recommend,the best fiber cereal i have ever eaten
11493,i decided to give this a try because their fiber bars were so good well i was not disappointed i have been eating this regularly since i bought it everyone including my year old loves it the best part we are meeting our daily requirement for fiber i know because we are pretty regular now it is great to eat something that is good for you and good too,my year old loves it
11494,excellent fiber content and yummy caramel flavour at a great price per case parents and kids happy with breakfast this week it is a whole grain flavor but we are used to that this makes a good home made trail mix ingredient with raisins nuts and a sprinkle of chocolate chips or m m of your choice enjoy,we love it
11495,i bought this just one box not a six pack on sale at a store i cannot believe how easy it is to get your fiber if you eat this cereal most cereals do not have even half this much fiber in them,do not have much fiber
11496,i enjoy a brakfast cereal in the morning this is great stuff with this i add low fat vanilla milk fruit and nuts it is a delicious combination additionally it is healthy in keeping me regular,fiber one
11497,i am actually eating candy coated sawdust br br i know that chicory root is a tree that i am eating sawdust but there is so much sugar i cannot stop it does not really taste like caramel to me it felt more like drinking maple syrup out of the bottle if you have tried it you will probably agree it is like eating maple syrup br br i m going to do some research now because i am having trouble thinking or breathing the beeping from my insulin pump is not helping br br carbs in serving count chocula br carbs in serving trix br carbs in serving crunch berries br carbs in serving reece puffs br br carbs in serving fiber one caramel delight cereal,i am eating candy coated sawdust
11498,i really enjoy this cereal it is really sweet so i mix it with the unsweetened fiber one original and a great price,great cereal
11499,the title says it all but seriously this stuff is great i have tried other high fiber cereals like kashi that just taste like leaves and twigs this cereal tastes great and it is high in fiber that is usually a difficult combo to find the subscribe save price also beats my local grocery store so get yourself a bowl and get poopin,it helps you poop
11500,i used to only like fiber one honey cluster but now i love it more i like the texture however it is a little sweet for me but do not get me wrong it is just me and it is only g of sugar per serving,love it
11501,i was just starting to think about healthy foods granola fiber etc and i already tried the cascadian farms maple brown sugar granola cereal ounce boxes pack of which is not as healthy and great tasting as this if you know about weight watchers points you will know what i am talking about next i have one of those weight watcher cards from a few years back ahem and i calculated that cup of this is only points the granola cereal was cup for points br br i did not think they could make such a good cereal with such low points it is those grams of fiber i love it br br fyi i paid with subscribe and save for a box of i like to post what i paid to help others in their decision at the time of purchase since prices change so frequently here br br happy eating,looking for healthy and flavorful stop here
11502,far and away the best cereal i have ever had my husband and i literally go through at least a box a week we have started ordering by the case because it is hard to find in our area br br yes it is sweet but i am a dyed in the wool frosted flakes fan so it was not too sweet for me if you look at many healthy cereals they have sugar too a cup of focd is only calories more than special k red berries my old healthy cereal br br i think the taste is rather like golden grahams not a lot of cinnamon that i could detect to make it taste like cinnamon toast crunch a healthy substitute would be the new total cinnamon crunch br br stars,best cereal ever i cannot get enough
11503,the product is great as a cereal or snack it is a very tasty and convenient way to get extra fiber in your diet problem occurred when only one ounce box was shipped but i was billed for the pack customer service quickly addressed the issue but i discontinued the auto ship,product great shipping billing error
11504,this cereal packs a punch it has a tremendous amount of fiber yet tastes like a delicious regular cereal my and year old boys love it,yummy and good for you
11505,the best in fiber as crunchy flakes great as is or topped with fruit plus added skim milk or yogurt and you have a fresh start to your day,pure health
11506,i tried this once and just tossed a whole box in the garbage the cereal looks like cinnamon toast crunch but it taste like some sort of fake caramel substitute it has a powdery coating that is worse than the butt end of a regular box of cereal with all the broken crumbs in the bottom the carmel flavor tastes fake and almost made me gag a few times,yuck
11507,as a young guy im concerned with taste and also fiber content this is high in sugar carbs but it is entirely justified for the great taste and the high fiber no other cereal taste this good and is moderately good for you other fiber one cereals maybe healthier but they taste like pinecones and sticks,sugary but high in fiber
11508,general mills keeps stepping up with each new flavor in the fiber one cereal line as good as the honey clusters and raisin bran varieties are this one may be the most fun to eat and will have you pouring yourself a bowl faster than you can run to the toilet it is fiber one after all the great thing is the taste which is very reminiscent of cinnamon toast crunch the squares in this cereal are dusted seemingly with cinnamon or caramel as the flavor claims sugar great cereal,wow it is like eating cinnamon toast crunch but good for you
11509,even my children love this cereal very similar to a cinnamon toast cereal that is out there,yummy yummy yummy
11510,fiber one products actually do not have real fiber they contain inulin from chicory root which is technically fiber because the body cannot digest it unfortunately fiber is defined by anything that cannot be broken down easily these products do not contain real fiber the real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and bran cereals so if it says chicory root or inulin in the ingredients you can be sure you are not eating the fiber your body can actually use so if you want lots of sugar and fat without fiber this product is for you,fiber none
11511,if you like caramel and you also want a low fat filling high fiber tasty snack this is perfect for you i love these bars,heavenly
11512,i have tried many different brands of rose jams and was alway disappointed because they were too sweet with very little flower flavoring i am so glad i found the kafka brand of rose preserves because this tastes exactly as it should with subtle aroma of rose you know you are getting the real thing in the kafkas brand because you can see some bits of the petals in the jam this is great alone on toast or paired with cream cheese or goat cheese even scoop some on a good brand of vanilla ice cream be creative this is delicious,absolutely the best
11513,i seem to have a love affair with roses i have always admired their beauty and fragrance and then few years ago i discovered they are edible the first time i tasted rose jam i was in vancouver bc it was served on buttery vanilla scones i knew i had to take some home with me since then i have tried other brands the kafka is quite good and actually has real bits of rose petals in it which really boosts that sweet flowery flavor in your mouth it has just the right amount of sweetness too my only beef is i found them at my local imports store for only i spent nearly ordering them from amazon,delicately sweet and rosey
11514,this is the best jelly i have ever had you get rose petal from every small bite of the jelly and it is not overwhelmingly sweet taste so rosy,delicious
11515,i first tried rose preserves at an algerian restaurant and i was hooked they are absolutely amazing and so delicious i knew i had to get a jar of my own br br this is now a staple in my household i use rose preserves on all sorts of things but crepes are probably my favorite rose preserves go wonderfully with both sweet and savory foods try it with goat cheese or brie you will not be disappointed it is also divine over ice cream and do not get me started on how great it is for baking br br these preserves are quite sweet so a little really does goes a long way which is nice the jar lasts quite a while even when i use it often they are high quality and the flavor cannot be beat i highly recommend these,so good

11517,condiments add such vibrancy and depth to dishes and this mustard can stand alone i had read about this mustard on a food blog written by a former chez panisse chef i knew i had to try it i am hooked it is a sublime addition to vinaigrette but when spread on rye bread with a few slices of ham love at first bite,best in show
11518,this mustard was given to me by a client this is truly the best dijon mustard i have ever had i highly recommend it i put it on literally everything the other night my husband and i slathered it onto steaks delicious,best mustard ever
11519,when i ordered this product i was too lazy to convert mm to inches and consequently discovered the coarse grinder salt was almost to be exact way too coarse for my salt grinder shortly after receiving my order from amazon i received a courtesy email from the spice lab to make sure i was happy with my order i replied that actually i was not happy but the fault was mine because i did not convert the metric dimensions to english units and consequently did not realize how coarse the salt would be which was too coarse for my salt mill two days later i received a package of smaller crystals no charge that is amazing customer service,amazing customer service
11520,this product seems to have replaced a similar previous product natural himalayan crystal salt the previous prodcut was a deeper pink color and the texture was better than what i was finding elsewhere this new product himalayan organic natural unprocessed cooking salt is much more like what the competitors are selling i have enjoyed all my products from the spice lab but was disappointed with the replacent for this product,product changed
11521,this pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor i did not know salt could vary in flavor until i tried this one we bought the salt initially because a it is organic and b my daughter wanted pink salt but the flavor is what really made the difference i do not know much about salt but i want to say that this has a rounded flavor meaning it is not harsh or distinctive on food rather it seems to become part of the food going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way sounds silly but i am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference,great salt
11522,yes i do use this product for salting some of my foods but it also has another handy use because the grains of salt are much larger than normal i use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet i pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel the salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the ridged bottom of my cast iron grill pan works perfectly i usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because i use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron,for more than salting foods
11523,we were pleased with this salt it is actually more salty than regular salt even kosher salt or sea salt a little bit goes a long way i do not usually cook with it but add it to things afterwards i have been hand grinding it,intensely salty healthy salt
11524,not sure but have been reading about himalayan salt and apparently there is a high fluoride in this salt according to several reviews i have read and that is not so good however it looks very nice in my salt mill and tastes much better than morton salt and i do not use it everyday also it is mined in pakistan if that really matters,fluoride content an issue
11525,placed the order on tuesday received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping super faster the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me in addition it came with samples himalayan salt lemon citron flake salt and cyprus white flake salt weighing quite a few grams each sorry does not say the weight and i do not have a scale with me at the moment br br as far as product quality goes i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods i have not tasted it yet but i bet it tastes like salt of course price wise this salt the spice lab is way cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods even including shipping,super fast shipping free samples
11526,this is a great salt it has a wholesome flavor and i noticed it does not make you thirsty or rise the blood pressure as regular salt does that is the benefit of the natural balance of minerals in it i would recommend this to friends and health conscious people,excellent
11527,this salt is so pink and taste like the ocean i love it make sure to buy a grinder of some sort if you plan to use it on salads or sprinkle on cold dishes,wonderful product
11528,this is the first time i have used land mined salt i usually use salt from various sea sources after reading several reviews here on amazon i decided to try this salt i was very pleasantly surprised the first time i tasted the salt the flavor was fresh and subtle not like the salt you usually buy in the grocery stores plus it has a lot of trace minerals your body needs i highly recommend this salt,excellent flavor
11529,i love pink himalayan salt it is loaded with minerals and taste great i do not have to use as much as the conventional table salt and i do not feel bad about using it because i know that it is also really good for my body,i love this salt
11530,the product has far fewer pink crystals than shown in the picture which is perfectly fine with me the salt is coarse excellent for salt mills it tastes great and the size is what i wanted and have not been able to find elsewhere the price and service is excellent as well,what i have been looking for
11531,i have not purchased this from amazon yet as still on what i purchased elsewhere but i noticed many people buying the one pound bag just to let you know one kilo equals lbs why would you buy the one pound bag on something that never goes bad when you can get more than double for just a few dollars more br br dr mercola comments regarding himalaya salt benefits are what started me using this initially a few years ago many micronutrients great purity one person questioned the iodine no salt naturally contains iodine unless it is iodized or contains some sort of seaweed you can easily see his comments at mercola com br br himalaya salt has a very clean taste add at the end of cooking,the only salt i use except herbamare and trocomare
11532,i bought himalayan organic salt twice each time quality was really good and service was fast and courteous the spice lab i will buy it again,good quality good service
11533,i was very pleased with the himalayan salt it really does taste much better than ordinary salt and you can actually taste some of the other minerals in it i would describe it like licking a salty rock but in a good way very pleased and will be buying more,wonderful product
11534,i have never ordered sea salt before i thought this was great i was afraid it would have some additional flavor that i wouldnt like instead it was fresh tasting natural i like the pink color but glad it doesnt come out pink,himalayan course salt
11535,i will certainly be a repeat customer i had a tough time finding large salt crystals to refill a grinder but this fit the bill nicely br br flavor is clean with slight minerality the color is not a deep as some other himalayan pink i have seen but it is a very good finishing salt and a good conversation piece when put on the table in a clear grinder br br also the seller included a coupon for a future purchase in the package which was a nice bonus,very good salt for a very good price
11536,this salt has a slightly earthy taste it is moderately coarse i bought a ceramic grinder for when i would like to have it a little finer i love this salt,so yummy
11537,great salt though now that i know how great it is i will have to buy a bigger bag next time mixed with some epsom salt and essential oils this makes a great bath salt ground up a bit finer it is wonderful for cooking will certainly buy again,great for cooking and baths
11538,i had been told that himalayan salt was much better for you after shopping around i found the best deal was through amazon it came in a heavy resealable bag and works great in my salt mill i would buy this again and recommend it to my friends,love this salt
11539,i use this salt very liberally now especially after finding out that its table salt you really need to avoid our bodies need salt to live and this is the purest kind out there i plan to make this salt a part of my regular diet,perfect
11540,i love this salt the delivery was quick the price was reasonable and the salt imparts a wonderful flavor to everything i eat and it does not burn my tongue i will be using this salt for ever more,himalayan salt
11541,i absolutely love this salt the flavor is awesome and at a great price no more box salt for me,great product
11542,i discovered this salt about years ago and have not looked back i love it the spice lab gives you a high quality product for a great price it is hard to describe himalayan salt you get more salty goodness without using so much it is delicious,great product
11543,great buy fantastic taste and pleasing pink hue from the iron content i prefer a grinding salt and this one is unprocessed for it is better for you,great coarse salt
11544,cannot tell it is any different than normal salt except for a slight pink tinge but if it has all the great minerals and stuff all the better,slightly pink in color but salt non the less
11545,this salt is so tasty it tastes nothing like the iodized table salt this has a light mild taste that greatly enhances meats vegetables etc it is pink peach color also looks very pretty in my clear cole mason grinder it grinds very finely with no issue in fact this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating almost like a powder around the inside of the clear grinder if you are a neat freak this might bug you a little and you might find yourself wiping out the top of the grinder great salt and the bag lasts a long time,great taste
11546,just like in the store for a fraction of the price i purchased this to refill my expensive pink salt grinder a million times better than table salt i do not know if it tastes any different from regular table salt but i think there is something about the shape of the crystals that changes the way the salt hits your tongue if you have a good grinder i highly recommend checking this stuff out,awesome
11547,this salt is great and way cheaper than any of the local spice shops it does seem more difficult to grind than other himilayan salts i have tried but doing a little at a time makes it well worth it would i buy it again yes,great salt difficult to grind
11548,this is a fine example of mineral rich himalayan salt the packaging also keeps it fresh it comes in a zip seal pouch,top notch
11549,fast service and item was exactly as described would purchase from this seller again they even sent along more information on this salt and others as well as sent me some samples,himalayan salt
11550,this is my kids favorite of the salts at the moment i like it too and will keep it in my collection great deal also and great company to do business with,great stuff
11551,the bag was smaller than i expected but that is probably just me being bad at estimating things the salt seems good however i was a little disappointed that the photo showed the salt to be much more vibrantly colored than they actually are i mean they are pink just not so bright pink as it shows the salt has a good flavor though i would say it was worth the price,good salt
11552,salt tastes fine cant say about the health claims stars is because of the packaging the grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind i have fairly large strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder for me when the grinder is mostly vertical to deg it is difficult impossible to grind directly onto food works fine if cap is left on held in a horizontal position them remove cap use the grind gives a nice fine grind better than my oxo i also got at amazon,difficult packaging
11553,i got this for work as i am a cook everyone noticed that i have had a change in the flavors of my food they said it was a good change personally i have enjoyed useing the salt in different foods i do like it very much,fantastic salt
11554,i use this pink himalayan course grain salt in salt grinders because it looks great but also i make my own homemade herbal salt using rosemary lemon thyme and pink himalayan course grain salt tastes great and look great in the grinders and shakers i have very satisfied i plan on making up some more herbal salts for christmas gifts using this pink himalayan salt very satisfied,pink himalayan course grain salt
11555,we grind our salt pepper spices fresh and this is out salt of choice it is milder than regular table salt which allows for more precise control of how salty you want your foods,excellent salt
11556,the spice lab is a completely wonderful company br i received my order promptly the salt is very high quality and a beautiful pink color br due to my miscalculation i ordered crystals that were too big for my grinder br i sent a note and asked if i could exchange it for smaller crystals br customer service answered quickly and said they were sending me a bag of smaller crystals completely free br how wonderful of them br you do not see that very often these days i commend spice lab for having such wonderful customer service i am now a dedicated customer thank you spice lab for my quality salt i am going to make sole and cook with it every day,himalayan sea salt
11557,silly me i did not even know there was such a thing as pink himalayan salt a friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style so now it is like buying a red ford mustang it is all you see on the road or in this case on the shelves of the stores br br i m actually glad i purchased this and have stopped using regular old white salt almost totally the salt does seem to have a milder taste but i do not find myself using any more of it than i did with the good old when it rains it pours variety br br since ordering this from amazon i have managed to find some here in my little town but it is way expensive when you purchase this you will also need a salt grinder unless you like throwing big chunks of salt at your food worth getting the two together however especially if you purchase a grinder with a glass container as the salt really looks attractive in a pretty transparent grinder and of course it tastes good too about it is nutritional value i admit to knowing zip does salt have nutritional value in the meantime i give this four stars if i find out more about the actual food value i will update this review,salt of the earth himalayan style
11558,best pink salt on the planet it will make all your dishes taste better spice lab is a trusted seller br br pink it is my new obsession br pink it is not even a question br pink on the lips of your lover cause br pink is the love you discover br br pink as the bing on your cherry br pink because you are so very br pink it is the color of passion br cause today it just goes with the fashion br br pink it was love at first sight br pink when i turn out the light and br pink gets me high as a kite br and i think everything is going to be all right br no matter what we do tonight br br you could be my flamingo br coz pink is the new kinda lingo br pink like a deco umbrella br it kink but you do not ever tell her br br pink it was love at first sight and br pink when i turn out the light br pink gets me high as a kite br and i think everything is going to be all right br no matter what we do tonight br br i want to be your lover br i wanna wrap you in rubber br as pink as the sheets that we lay on br pink it is my favorite crayon yeah br br pink it was love at first sight br pink when i turn out the light br pink it is like red but not quite br and i think everything is going to be all right br no matter what we do tonight,pink it was love at first sight
11559,i put it in a glass jar for chow watmore ken i talk about it is pink salt i resifet it fest,i like it
11560,i ordered this product as my previous paprika supply was nearing exhaustion my previous supply was the same brand and also in the ounce package for some reason these large containers are no longer available in my local grocery stores so i turned to the internet for help to date i have not used any of this paprika but well when my current supply of homemade bbq sauce is exhausted br br i had not previously purchased from this supplier however the shipment delivery was prompt and it was well packaged i am very satisfied with the supplier and would not hesitate to purchase from them again,paprika supplier
11561,actually typed in smoked paprika this showed up so i ordered it and it is definatly not smoked also these bottles sell for at sam so not only was it the wrong item but i over paid also,not what i expected
11562,this is regular paprika you buy in the grocery store its good and a great price,dont let the name fool you
11563,for a friend who loves jellies and turtles he said they were soft and chewy just the ways he likes them and even though they were his favourite animal he could not stop eating em,turtle power
11564,not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies more on the sweet side coconut is listed in the ingredients but you certainly will not taste it my son liked them so they will not go to waste i would not buy them again,needs more lemon flavor
11565,not too dry br not too wet br not too hard br not too soft br br perfect for when you want to give your dog a treat and are heading out the door by the time you open the door and turn around to check on him the treat has been chomped to bit and swallowed not fear of a choking while you walk out,the perfect commuter dog treat
11566,i am in love with the mix line of protein drinks as someone with a sensitive stomach it has always been a challenge for me to find protein drinks that do not irritate my stomach and also taste great and have a good nutritional profile mix is the only brand i have found that meets all of these requirements br br i ordered the vanilla shake as soon as i saw that it was available on amazon i really enjoy it br br it has a very natural vanilla flavour and does not taste artificial like most vanilla flavoured protein drinks it tastes like a delicious vanilla milkshake but without the heaviness of a real milkshake the consistency of this shake is a little bit thinner than the regular mix protein drinks that i am used to but it is definitely not watery i really like it for breakfast because in the morning i do not usually feel like downing a whole one of the regular mix protein drinks with the slightly thicker consistency i prefer those in the afternoon,another great protein drink from mix
11567,i think this is one of the best protein shakes on the market all natural with grams of protein and grams of fiber mix is light tasting and almost refreshing great for pre or post work outs or just inbetween meals for a protein boost great for vegetarians and those who are soy lacrtose intolerant i love the vanilla one and i am a chocolate person,of the best
11568,i love to have the vanilla mix for breakfast or after s run it took me forever to find a drink that was both lactose and soy free my tummy love mix,love
11569,mix is my favorite post recovery drink after a long run or bike ride i especially like the vanilla mix it goes down easy and smooth and is very refreshing it is a great recovery protein drink with lots of extra vitamins minerals nutrients thrown in some protein drinks are too thick or chalky or just do not taste very good mix is my favorite i know it is replenishing my body after a hard workout,love mix for post recovery after a long run or bike ride
11570,mix vanilla is really great and versatile stuff for starters i love that the protein source is whey and not soy they also use real ingredients and are locally made in boulder co mix is great as a meal replacement meal supplement snack recovery drink since they do not require refridgeration i keep on in my ski bag as a apres ski drink i get hungry on the drive back into town and mix works great i also do triathlons and find that mix is great as a pre race meal and does not upset my stomach later on while i am racing finally mix is a perfect recovery drink after a long workout,erin t
11571,unlike some other faux milk sports drink mix is worth the calories br pros easily digestible with a good mouth feel not sour or slimy br the nutritional value vitamins and minerals makes it worth the calorie expenditure br unlike some rival products tastes like vanilla not overly sweet or fake br haven t tried it but would probably make a good smoothie w fresh or frozen fruit br cons can be pricey and hard to find br not a vegan product because it contains milk solids can t recommend to vegan friends br unlike the recyclable plastic bottles the fruit mix flavors come in the tetrapaks used for the chocolate and vanilla flavors are hard to drink without a straw br br but overall i recommend vanilla mix especially since recently my favorite mix flavor blueberry vanilla has disappeared from the shelves,nutrition value taste worth the calories
11572,so much better than other protein products in drugstores or even gnc taste great and does not fill up like other shakes do so you can work out after quickly relatively cheap for all the good things you get with it,great ingredients and quality product
11573,i was introduced to this brand in aruba this coffee is sold in aruba supermarkets and jar label is in spanish br when i found it at amazon i was very excited i was immediately disappointed after first cup br coffee in aruba is rich tasty and very smooth my wife and i had been enjoying this brand for more than years br the coffee sold in us is complete opposite to same brand sold in aruba i do not know why the same brand would be so br different unless it is a grey market product with a look alike label br,do not buy it
11574,love this coffee if you like a strong dark rich tasting cup of coffee this coffee is for you another plus is that this coffee is easy on the stomach not too acidic i will be coming back to amazon for more,rich dark and delicious
11575,it is all cayenne and not authentic bebere way too spicy threw it out and made my own,way too spicy
11576,i discovered this hot sauce while traveling around in belize it is on most tables in a lot of restaurants it has a lovely tang from the grapefruit and is not tongue burning off hot but a pleasing gentle heat i am never without,one of my favorites
11577,my finicky cats would not eat this food so i gave it to my neighbor who rescues cats so the food would not go to waste,my cats would not eat it
11578,right now i own cats that i found outside a good eight years ago and i found another cat which i adopted also i have always fed them eukanuba adult lamb rice dry cat food and they truly love it when you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma of the cats that i found outdoor and adopted one turned out to be a turkish angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard and the third cat i found out is part egyptian mau i also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for years they all love this food and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago they still eat it and love it if you read the ingredients it is excellently made and a real plus for their diet they have been eating it for years now and i have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food br br the other dry foods that my cats love is fancy feast gourmet filet mignon flavor with real seafood shrimp dry cat food and they have just started eating eagle pack natural pet food indoor formula for cats and a cat food brand called artemis i have not any problems with them eating any of these dry foods and i have been rescuing cats for over years now and have owned as many as cats at one time one set of kittens were born outdoor and i brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on they all lived to be close to years of age and they too ate eukanuba lamb rice and loved it br br i have had foods that they turned up their nose with like chicken soup and taste of the wild the same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes what is good for one cat might not be good for another you just have to learn your cat and see what they like and just give it to them while my cats are in love with eukanuba lamb rice maybe your cat will also or maybe not but it is not fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat does not like it as previously stated maybe your cat will not like it or maybe your cat will love it i have tried cat foods based on good reviews figuring that the food will automatically be a hit and sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn t it is all up to the cat,very palatable and healthy food
11579,i was searching for a source of pure vanilla without any fillers but without the hassle of the vanilla bean br this ground vanilla is amazing no fillers easy to use amazing taste and aroma br i will be purchasing this again,delicious
11580,this is a wonderful english breakfast tea nicely flavorful without being either too bold or too bland makes a wonderful morning tea without any sort of bitterness or tang y taste to it it is a nice comfort tea and a good start to loose teas for anyone who has been using bags and does not know which flavor loose teas to start with br br i recommend brewing as follows teaspoons to ounces of boiling water for minutes if you overbrew particularly adagio teas there is a chance for bitterness so i would not recommend leaving it in the water for a long time br br another recommendation is adagio irish breakfast which i slightly prefer but both teas are standouts,delicious breakfast tea
11581,i have been drinking other brands of black tea but i am going to switch to this one other english breakfast mixes taste like strong black tea good but not worth writing about this one tastes like i cannot put names to all the things happening in my mouth but i know the blend is worth every penny,heaven in a tin
11582,gatorade was an acquired taste for me but these days i cannot stop drinking it it is full of electrolytes and it does indeed have very few calories especially when you consider how it helps you rehydrate at the same time you can drink this either cold from the refrigerator or warm from the shelf i like it either way and actually when i drink it warm the flavor tastes even better br br this pack comes in three flavors fruit punch lemon lime and grape br br the only negative i can think of is that this does have sugar and carbs in it if you have concerns about sugar in your diet you should talk to your physician before drinking this br br highly recommended,all right by me
11583,these chocolates are made in small batches in kohler wisconsin we use to drive to kohler to buy them it is good to know that you can order them on amazon each piece has an amazing combination of flavors and textures i particularly enjoy the ones with molasses they are called blackstrap terrapins let me know if you like them,the best chocolates
11584,these seeds are on the edge of their sell by date not very good for the small scale gardener who wants to save some for next year germination rates are at about too early to tell much about the plants but i will update again if they do well,low germination rates
11585,i come from a family of professional gardeners and i cannot grow plants to save my life these seeds however did get started and actually grew a few inches however the rabbits in our garden thought the plants very tasty so clearly there is nothing wrong with the product it the gardener,seeds of change s certified organic italian white eggplant
11586,i get around a shipment a week all year round from amazon and i can not remember ever writing a review but i am making a point of expressing my anger over this product i buy lots of tea from many sources and white peony is one of my favorites the package says it is organic and of the finest quality it was possibly the worst tea i have ever tasted in fact after a couple of pots i actually threw nearly the whole half pound in the trash and the price was not even that good i subsequently bought a pound of excellent organic white peony from whole foods for less whatever they are this is not a tea company,do not buy from this company
11587,i was anticipating a fragrant unprocessed minimally oxidized tea that is unique to all white teas this tea could not be farther from that description heavily oxidized with a very strong smoky flavor not even palatable on a second flush please save your money and consider paying a few more dollars from a supplier such as rishi or specialteas,huge disappointment
11588,i love steak although i do not eat it all that often anymore when i do have a steak though i absolutely love the taste of a which brings out the best in any cut of meat although i am not too enthusiastic about putting it on seafood which the label suggests as a good idea i think it goes well with any kind of beef and works well on chicken and turkey as well it is an essential ingredient in many marinades and is generally one of the most used items for meat preparation in my refrigerator br br what many people do not realize is the long and noble history of a which dates to in when a king palate reigned supreme henderson william brand chef to england king george iv created a sauce for king george for use on meats king george was so impressed with it that he proclaimed it a and that is how the sauce got its name br br beyond the history lesson though i think king george was correct in his gustatory proclamation this sauce really is a,years old and still the best
11589,i can hardly eat a hamburger steak roast or any kind of beef without a sauce i get really annoyed when i run out of a sauce a is the best steak sauce out there it has a great tangy spicy flavor that enhances enjoyment of many meat products especially beef and it makes tough or poor beef or steaks at least tolerable br br a is the best steak sauce in my book,my favorite steak sauce
11590,i cannot believe i am reviewing steak sauce here but here goes the best steaks do not need any sauce but when you are dining on something below the sirloin cut a is a mealsaver nothing beats it it is also good on tenderloin ribeye or filet mignon but if the meat is top quality you want to taste the meat not the sauce br br a is very good on hamburgers when you want a little zip i especially like it on lean ground sirloin burgers the leaner the meat the more you need a little something else to give it some zip ketchup gets the job done but a is a nice detour from the ordinary,best for zest
11591,i live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the usa who just had a baby recently i wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual clothing toys etc i decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best i reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that spring in the air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in colombia and ships them right away via fedex while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the usa br br with that said i was sure that my roses were going to live even longer probably a week or two more compared to other roses bought at amazon in addition for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality so i gave them a try br br the results they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar firstly their communication goes far beyond usual amazon sellers they keep you posted on how your order is doing received being processed and sent plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers nice and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when fedex first attempts to do so br br i wrote to the seller to see if i could have a change in the from to card i initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request even on a weekend br br roses arrived when promised and an hour later i was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality i was relieved the plan worked perfectly br br thank you spring in the air i will surely buy from you again please keep up the good job great service and outstanding roses you have,outstanding service and quality
11592,hypoallergenic formula was necessary for our daughter acid reflux br br we found out from a friend that most insurance companies will completely cover the cost of hypoallergenic formula either by reimbursing you what you have spent on it or if you get it as a prescription through your pediatrician ours did br br many doctors do not know this so they do not know to give a prescription for the formula call your insurance company today,insurance will pay for hypoallergenic formula
11593,i love this syrup it doesnt have all those added ingredients its not like dark amber syrup thats extra sweet a little bit goes a long way when i pour it on my waffles i only need to pour it in the middle and thats enough for whole waffle so if you think this little bottle wont work for big families you would be mistaken i use half as much as i would with the fructose added syrups,a little goes a long way
11594,i buy these for my yorkies for beautiful hair and healthy hearts they love the salmon paws with broccoli and no diarrhea issues br from the salmon because of the broccoli good for their sensitive digestive systems and nice chewy texture for their teeth easily broken up is a big plus for tiny mouths seller is very prompt and never a problem,yorkies love these
11595,after oberto cocktail pepperoni no other will do it keeps well and is a great low carb snack for the atkins dieter i also like the large ounce bag amazon has available,the best cocktail pepperoni on the market
11596,these are the same product as the bite size in the smaller blue bag except that they are longer links and vary in length br br the ingredient list is somewhat gross as it lists specific parts of the pig if you can get past that the taste is unmatched br br the slim jim ingredient list was similarly disturbing to me as slim jim has as separate ingredients chicken and mechanically separated chicken i do not understand why one or the other does not cover both,excellent if you do not read ingredients
11597,very tasty gourmet food easy to keep and store easy to prepare could be eaten as packed or warmed in microwave toaster oven frying pan or directly over flame or charcoal grille goes well with pasta and other spanish italian or french dishes best with crackers and cheese rice or even eaten alone matches well with soda beer wine or any beverage for that matter perfect to take along during trips they are so good i panic whenever i run out of stock,oh boy oberto cocktail pep
11598,ordered these for my diet they are high in protein and only calories per stick they are great for a meal replacement as one stick will fill you up and keep you full for a long time i have my stick during lunch at with a glass of water and i am not hungry until dinner time at,pepperoni sticks
11599,with the subscribe and save option i can get these cocktail pep sticks delievered to my home every months an pack lasts me a while as i try not to eat them daily even tho they are so good its hard to restrain myself these are much cheaper on amazon than in my local store so i often look to amazon for beef jerky type purchases,just like i remember as a kid but more affordable on amazon
11600,you cannot find these bad boys in kentucky so i usually have my mom ship me a bag every now and then thank goodness you can buy these online now i do not have to talk to my mom as much,oh boy oberto are
11601,my kids enjoy the cocktail pepsticks so ii buy them and send them to my kids br br oh boy oberto cocktail pepperoni pound sticks count bag,oboy oberto are the best
11602,this cocktail pep is absolutely the best there is i live somewhere that it is not sold in stores so i am constantly buying different types of pepperoni to substitute for oberto cocktail pepperoni and none of the many that i have tried have even come close,the best there is
11603,my son is in mcc in washington state he received these items and so far no complains,very good
11604,delicious pepperoni been buying oberto since just wish we could find these large packages in the stores,nothing better
11605,vendor provided quick service and a fresh product packaged securely the o boy oberto cocktail pep tasted just the way i remembered,cocktail pep
11606,oh boy oberto love those pepperoni sticks br it is nice to get a big supply i just wish they lasted longer,oberto pepperoni
11607,my dad introduced me to these things when i was kid we used to eat them all the time on opening day of the trout season or deer hunting up in the cascades my brother always calls them heart attack in a bag even though he cannot stop eating them they really are that good,seattle tradition
11608,i have been eating these since the early s they are my favorite brand of all time it seems they are getting impossible to find even from oh boy oberta my package arrived today and they are as fresh as the day from the factory meaning well preserved and soft i hope i can find more,absolute best pep stick for the money
11609,i really enjoyed the smoked sausages it took me nearly weeks to finish but i would definitely purchase this again br br a href http www amazon com gp product b wl u oh boy oberto cocktail pep smoked sausage sticks pound package a,oh boy oberto ohhhhhh goooood
11610,so tasty they did not last much longer than a week br br i was hoping for the thicker pep logs but these hit the spot i will be ordering more until i can find a source for the larger ones outside of gas stations,tastes great just wish they sold the larger diameter logs
11611,i have always liked oberto sausage and these short bite sized links are very handy,oberto sausage sticks
11612,i have never had any qualms with the oberto brand and this is an excellent deal especially as a gift subscription every two months and my dad has an essentially limitless supply of oberto cocktail pepperoni this stuff tastes so good too i may have to steal some from him,excellent product and deal
11613,o boy oberto pep sticks and sausage sticks are the best i buy them when i get to seattle,great product
11614,when we first bought these we tried to eat one and couldn t looked at the ingredients and found its mostly pig hearts taste is awful our dog however thinks they are great so we cut them up in small pieces and hide them around for him or forage out by smell after about a week the contents of the bag start to mold since they are for the dog we washed them off and then store in the fridge too bad we had hoped these would be good snacks for football parties etc not recommended for people food,our dog loves these
11615,oberto cocktail pep used to be so much better than this i had been buying them direct from the oberto online store for many years and i could not get enough no matter what size i ordered they were always excellent br br however in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down they used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly and they had a superior spicy flavor br br nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland often stale flavor i get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did i believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about br br every year or so i get to craving those old style cocktail pep that i loved so much and i order a package hoping that they will have changed i keep thinking maybe i just got a bad batch last time but every time i am disappointed all over again,these used to be so much better
11616,this is not the best tasting pepperoni but it is acceptable and you certainly get a lot of it for the money,best bang buck
11617,i thought this was a great deal in the warehouse deals section but it was pretty nasty and smelled like dog food when i opened each bag slim jim is made of crap too but at least it tastes good,tastes a lot like dog food
11618,this does not taste like peperoni more like slim jim except this uses real sausage casing slim jim uses paper shhh,at least it is not slim jim
11619,the pepperoni is fantastic as usual amazon was not while i cancelled the order on my end it was a duplicate of my son they did not acknowledge it although i got an e mail confirming the cancellation because it was food there are no returns looks like bags every months instead of one,great product sloppy service
11620,when i first took a bite i seriously thought i was eating dog food these are disgusting i searched the bag for dog food and the expiration date thinking that it was bad for one of those reasons i do not know how anyone can like these,dog food
11621,this item molded days after opening stored in air tight container i would give it if i could tasted very much like cereal nothing like pepperoni,horrible
11622,this item molded days after opening stored in air tight container i would give it if i could tasted very much like cereal nothing like pepperoni,disappointed
11623,they taste more like chemicals than meat i like a lot of jerky and meat sticks but would not eat these the dogs liked them though,worst meat snack i ever tried
11624,oh boy oberto cocktail pep smoked sausage sticks ounce bag purchased on br br this was the worst product i have ever tasted i have had many oberto products and this was nothing like what i have eaten before even my dog would not eat them they were so nasty tasting,yuck
11625,a word of caution to anyone considering buying these read the ingredients first i made the mistake of thinking they would be the same as the longer oberto brand ones our local costco used to sell so i ordered up bags to get the volume discount offered at the time i knew something was not right as soon as i opened up the first bag and got a whiff then i read the ingredients and was shocked when i saw that they actually use pork hearts as the top ingredient to eliminate any doubt i tasted one we have been using them as expensive doggy treats ever since,yuk
11626,these quickly became dog treats just nasty i do not even know how they can sell these for human comsumption stay away,better than dog food maybe
11627,only good use for these would be in case of poisoning use to induce vomiting,too bad you cannot give it stars
11628,excellent service excellent price excellent product i cannot keep the dog off the phone telling her friends how much she is enjoying her best buddy treats i have a very happy dog,dog treats
11629,my dog loves the treats i have a yorkie and they are just the right size for him i let a friend give her dog some and they loved them also,best buddy bones
11630,the seller is great i received them in a timely manner they shipped when they said they would i think these are great treats they smell fresh the are crunchy treats there not too hard and not too soft my dog lucy likes them but it is not her favorite she does not get too excited about them but she does eat them that is why i did not give them stars,peanut butter flavor treats
11631,my maltese absolutely loves anything that exclusively pets makes but if you really want to train your pet give him or her a cheese treat the greatest thing about their products is that they smell exactly like whatever the package says the cheese treats smell like cheez it the carob cookie treats smell like chocolate chip cookies so forth and so on i used to buy these locally but saved buying them online,doggie love
11632,first impression the friendly folks over at exclusively dog heard about my website and sent me of their products to test br let me just start off by saying that i love how sweet all of these treats taste dad was is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies plus the ingredients are very straight forward they are probably healthier than most the stuff mom eats but there in lies the problem dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age the second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar as we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar and just like humans can develop diabetes br br conclusion your puppy is nearly guaranteed to love the taste however these should only be used as an occasional treat if you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day they would soon plump up if you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly you may want to think twice on the pro side they are all natural with no animal bi products out of paws because dad made me if we were judging on taste alone they would be a,out of paws
11633,the pistachios are large fresh and delicious this cute bag makes a perfect hostess gift and a nice holiday gift for casual friends,great nuts
11634,i have been using butter ghee for cooking purposes and found this product on amazon the color is much darker than the grocery store product i had been using and this product has a richer flavor as well i have been buying grassfed butter online as well and it is clear there is a flavor difference i would recommend this product and will continue to buy it for cooking butter is good for bread ghee is better for cooking and grass fed is the best,simply delicious flavor
11635,i am somewhat of a foodie food snob and this ghee is excellent as well as containing all the health benefits that ghee should contain the cows are grassfed which means more of the fat burning cancer fighting cla they use non homogenized milk which is linked to heart disease and tastes amazing i will be buying more of this,excellent product
11636,i do not know if i have a lot of credibility to review this since this is the first time i tried ghee i loved the booklet that comes with the purchase and assures that this is grass fed ghee which was my main consideration it is great for cooking since it does not smoke or burn even on high temperatures,good stuff
11637,this organic grass fed ghee embodies everything that a modern healthful food should be it is tasty healthful fresh and lovingly produced by hand in small batches and according to ages old methods and principles br br i began using this ghee as a part of a transition to eating more healthy home cooked foods more recently i participated in an ayurvedic cleanse that required that i take cup of plain warm ghee for several mornings straight though this can be an unpleasant experience with ghee of lower quality the pure indian foods ghee was truly delicious the flavor is clean and sweet without any of the harshness or overbearing unctuousness of other ghees even those labelled as organic and not a hint of rancidity to which i am very sensitive br br only unhomogenized milk is used for this ghee which is unusual and extremely beneficial homogenization alters the structure of milkfats and adversely impacts their bioavailability and handling in the blood this attention to the quality of raw materials is just one example of this company dedication to their customers health br br highly recommended,a perfect ghee
11638,i tried both this brand and the a href http www amazon com gp product b iipmw purity farm organic ghee clarified butter ounce a brand of ghee because as far as i can tell these are the two brands that are from completely grass fed cows which i was elated to see because of the health and flavor benefits br br i ll say that this one takes the slight edge in the taste and aroma department it has a rich buttery smell and it seems like they clarify it a little less because it is slightly grainy when you taste it at room temperature br br that said i find myself buying the purity farm ghee because this brand is almost twice as expensive and while it has the edge in taste it is very very slight and not worth the big premium to me it might be worth it if i was primarily using this at room temperature like on bread but i usually use regular butter for that and for cooking you really cannot tell any difference in flavor there is also a chance i am getting ghee from different times of the year for each brand which does affect the flavor br br so in short amazing high quality ghee but a bit overshadowed by the much cheaper and also amazing high quality a href http www amazon com gp product b iipmw purity farm organic ghee clarified butter ounce a brand ghee,tastes amazing but a bit expensive
11639,i have made my own ghee and purchased various brands of ghee i have also tried traditional moroccan ghee smen and it can be strong and tangy i found a review of this brand on an organic vegan website and it commented on the fresh sweetness of this ghees scent that review was right this is bar none the sweetest scented butter product i have tried absolutely delightful it is more expensive than other brands i have tried i am not sure how they process it to get this fresh sweet butter scent but i will use it in my baking when the sweet buttery scent is most noticeable in sauteing this delicate scent is covered by meat and or vegatable scents if you like a tangy butter scent to cut through with an oregano tinge try smen zamouri spices carries it,sweetest i tried
11640,since shifting to a paleo diet i have been limiting my butter intake to nearly none at all and to be honest i miss it from time to time when i saw that the whole approved this particular ghee for their whole program i was ecstatic i immediately ordered it and have been thrilled ever since the texture the flavor the smell it is all so incredible a little bitty bit goes a very long way i love cooking with this eating it on sweet potatoes mixing it with mashed cauliflower anywhere i would have used butter i use this ghee instead it is so buttery rich delicious i highly recommend giving it a try it does not leave my counter it adds such great flavor to all the meals that get cooked in it,if dallas and melissa approve then it must be good
11641,ghee is more than an indulgence ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement albeit one that tastes really good ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion but it can be a healthy addition to any diet br br some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol br br i performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available i compared quality and value ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used br br the ghee comparison table can be found at this blog see link in comment br br when i started this ghee comparison i was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products however i learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards it was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available it is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on amazon com grass fed organic ghee is one of those top picks br br because such high quality ghees are available i focused on understanding which product is the most authentic some of the ghees are much more authentic than others the information in the table link above reflects that fact br br the focus of my evaluation was not gourmet cooking it was optimum health therefore i was concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest br br i rank grass fed organic ghee as one of the very best products grass fed organic ghee is made in accord with the ancient traditions such as phase of the moon chanting etc it is a great quality great tasting product and the good price makes it a great value i highly recommend this ghee,very high quality ghee and a great value
11642,this ghee is the best available the fat is high quality and the nutrients are powerful due to the fact that the ghee is made from grass fed butter during the spring and fall season when the cows are eating fast growing green grass that last part is important that means that this ghee has high amounts of k compared to other ghees k is the great bone and teeth building nutrient it helps the body deposit calcium appropriately k cannot be gotten from green leafy vegetables it can only be gotten from animal fats organ meats or some kinds of fermented vegetables br br also apparently this ghee has tested as high in k as the very expensive butter oil that i used to buy br br finally i have seen an improvement in my kids teeth since i have been giving them several spoonfuls of ghee each day we use it like a supplement br br thank you for a high quality product,best ghee available
11643,halfway through my first jar and even though this is only the nd brand of ghee i have ever used i do much prefer it to the last one which had a strange flavor grass fed is the way to go the new buzz word for healthy and i am willing to pay extra for what i believe to be high quality i just wished they offered their larger sizes via amazon as well since that would be a better value,so far so good
11644,this company ghee was highly recommened in a book called cure tooth decay heal prevent cavities with nutrition the author ramiel nagel referred to ghee as one of the nature foods that contains a healthy and natural fat to help us rebuild tooth enamel and keep gums strong and healthy i purchased the ghee because i observed a cavity starting and wanted to fix it without going to the denist using harmful drugs since i have been following a few simple suggestions in this book the tooth enamel is rebuilding this book also contains other recipes and foods that can help cure and prevent cavities br br getting back to the ghee when i visited pure foods website i was very pleased that they had several kinds of ghee including the regular for example they have digestive ghee which includes spices helpful for digestion some of which are also traditionally used to make chai tea i love this digestive ghee because i can make regular black tea and add the digestive ghee a little sweetner and it makes a nice chai tea it warms me up during the cold and dampness and another added benefit my stools come out much smoother and constipation is usually eiliminated completely when i use it consistently they also have ghees for recipes with chicken fish and stake i have used these other ghees in a few receipes for chicken soup on salmon and of course lamb stew i enjoy it very much yes they are sold separately from the regular ghee oh they also have very small sample sizes to try before purchasing a large size,various kinds of ghee by pure foods
11645,i have been using this ghee for years now and can say that it is hands down the best the quality is unsurpassed i have spoken with the owner of the company a really nice man who told me his wife hand packs the jars this is truly a family business and one that i feel happy supporting,excellent product from an excellent company
11646,we consume lot of ghee and we always get our ghee from india i was looking for alternative source and amazon was the to go place tried many brands kids have a bench mark to compare none of them met their standards tried this they have not complained about unusual state or smell i could not agree more br br i only wish amazon had bigger size bottles i can always order directly from company store but its not the same service as amazon,excelent product wish it comes in big size
11647,i ordered this after finding out that it is not good to cook with olive oil this was my first time trying ghee and i really like it when i ran out i bought another brand of ghee from the story but i definitely like this one better i just wish they had a bigger size,i love it
11648,wonderful flavor full of easily assimilated vitamins and minerals my son is allergic to dairy except for ghee he does well with this product because it is both organic and grass fed i wish i could buy it locally to cut down on packaging though,great product that i wish i could buy locally
11649,i really really like this ghee not sure if i love it yet all i know that my food does not burn as fast for all clad frying pan owners you will love this food does not stick and burn onto the frying pan so clean up is much faster not sure if there is a taste difference from my previous ghee but the grass fed component does make it seem better golden brown french toasts out of,ghee tastic
11650,this is an excellent product i wish it were less expensive and came in larger containers however i really like the fact that it is organic and comes from grass fed cows which i believe produces a healthier product,grassfed organic ghee
11651,pure ghee is a staple in our home although it may seem to be a luxury to spend on a condiment it will become one of those ingredients one cannot live without i have tried many health food store commercial brands and i have tried to make my own but they pale in comparison my yo son loves to cook eggs in ghee and is quite disappointed when we are running low and usually adds ghee to our amazon cart it is essential for those who follow a gaps diet wise tradition or other healthy fat lifestyle if not no matter pure ghee tastes great on toast popcorn and any indian indonesian recipe and great for traveling camping pack backing because it does not require refrigeration some spend on expensive coffee great wines or cheeses or other gourmet products but if we had to choose pure ghee always comes first in our home,cannot live without pure ghee
11652,once you have used ghee butter will not do i eat a strict paleo eating regimine a href http www amazon com gp product the primal blueprint reprogram your genes for effortless weight loss vibrant health and boundless energy primal blueprint series a with that i have given up dairy the bane of our healthcare problems and it was suggested i try ghee which is virtually lactose free i brush this on chicken breasts that i bake and sprinkle crushed raw sunflower seeds on top of and bake for an hour and thirty minutes or so the taste of this ghee is wonderful after baking and the chicken crisps up just right i have not used it for anything else but i am sure i will,one of the best ghees made
11653,great to make popcorn with i even put some on a sweet potato i cannot get raw butter so i use this as a substitute,oh gee ghee
11654,i just took out my freshly baked whole wheat and rye bread out of oven waited until it cooled down cut a slice and put some of that awesome ghee on top that is all no jam no nothing and this is definetly the taste i have been looking for pure natural butter taste just even a little would do the trick wholesome butter taste just like my grandmom used to make back at home i am not indian but still this is the pure and healty butter i remember from my childhood i am not a typical review writer but this ghee deserved an extra effort my kids love the taste as well we will never buy that famous store butter sticks anymore,wow pure wholesome healty butter
11655,delightful flavor fantastic for stir fried vegies only coconut oil cooks this well but it does not add that great flavor if you eat primal this is great you cannot find this at the grocery,outstanding product
11656,this is a great product it tastes really good and i love that it is grass fed i will definitely buy this again,great ghee
11657,i just got it yesterday and used it as a spread on bread i never want to be without it it tastes so buttery before i used to use different spreads like butter cream cheese mayo but now everything is getting replaced with this grass fed ghee because not only is it a much healthier option but it tastes so much better br i get my organic free range eggs from a local feed store and i bet they will be great fried in ghee ohhh and popcorn br i found when i put it in the fridge it got to hard to be manageable so i keep it in the pantry br it is a little expensive but i think a little goes a long way really do not need to use that much,sooo buttery
11658,i was introduced to ghee during my yoga studies in southern india this is the best ghee i have found in the u s it is slightly superior to the ancient organics brand in my opinion due to richer color and flavor br br thanks to the website i now pop my own organic popcorn in ghee as well as using it almost exclusively to cook with as the heat does not destroy its beneficial properties br br as someone who used to be afraid of fat i am so glad i discovered this ghee it is delicious and i know i am giving my body a healthy oil change at the same time,nourishing delicious
11659,this stuff is awesome tastes better than butter with a nice smoky finish great on veggies as a spread or to use in cooking highly recommend,awesome taste great on almost anything
11660,i love that this ghee is organic and grass fed i also love that it is rich and delicious has a great shelf life not that it lasts long in my house and is easy to use i am off to melt a few spoonfuls onto some popcorn now,delicious
11661,this ghee has a richness and depth of flavor that i have found in no other ghee it is so very yummy that i do not even consider buying cheaper brands i value that it is from grass fed cows too great product,this is the best ghee i have tried by far
11662,i stumbled upon this product while looking for organic butter made from non uht milk this is by far the best ghee i have tasted in a long long time this ghee reminded me of my childhood days the milk man would bring the cow to our door hand express milk this milk would then be boiled the cream saved for buttermilk culture then churned to extract butter and eventually boiled to make ghee that is the only way i know authentic ghee can be made and that is exactly how this product tastes br i will come back for more and more often,its gheetastic
11663,we started using ghee in place of oils to help our daughter with severe autism she appears to be in better health and mood since this change we have tried four different varieties of ghee but this is the best tasting and fits into more recipes because of the mild taste there is a big price difference but this brand is worth the extra money,best ghee available
11664,while this was my first ghee purchase i was looking to satisfy several criteria for my the type of ghee i wanted i wanted it to be organic and from grass fed or pastured cows only this ghee definitely fits both of those requirements i had seen this specific brand receive high marks on amazon as well as a few other sites in addition to the fact that it is produced in the us made it only better with all of this said this stuff is absolutely delicious it has a wonderful nutty butter like flavor and cooks in an excellent fashion although i have not tried other brands of ghee i can highly recommend this one i will certainly be buying more only wish amazon carried bigger jars,absolutely delicious
11665,this stuff is yummy i was afraid to try this since i love regular butter so much i have read about the health benefits of ghee and after ordering this i am hooked it is so delicious i use it to butter my popcorn saute veggies on my toast etc the best part is that it is grass fed it is one of the only grass fed ghees i can find grass fed is so much better than grain fed i will continue to buy this and hoping they will start selling a larger jar so i will not have to keep ordering it twice a month lol,awesome
11666,this is the first ghee i have ever used for cooking and it tastes really pure it is the only one on amazon as far as i know thats usda organic hence higher price i am going to try and different one now to see how this one compares with one that is not organic,great taste
11667,love the smell of the ghee just reminded me of the authentic ghee we used to get back in india the fact that the ghee is made of grass fed cows is for me a huge relief i am so glad i found this treasure hope they reduce the price a little so that i can buy more with out guilt,good ghee
11668,i simply love this ghee i feel good knowing that it is giving me nutritous vitamins and cla while tasting great i use it on my pop corn and also have just used it in other cooking the back label also says that it does not have casein and lactose in it which many people have allergies to which i try to avoid thanks again great yummy product,ghee yummy
11669,pure indian foods ghee is so great it is applied to joints heals arthritis and promotes flexibility deeply penetrating medicine promotes rejuvenation softens strengthens and builds this is the best product on the market it is an essential ingredient in any healing massage eat a tablespoon in the morning and at night with some tea and in the meantime mix it with honey beeswax some olive oil and herbs like arnica montana for a soothing healing massage session this ghee is delicious and the texture is very special whichever way this ghee is used brings immediate and permanent benefits i put it on my eyes and my belly button and kneecaps before going on a jog when i wash it off i use dr bronners magic soap for full effect i hope you too will discover the benefits of this marvelous medicinal ghee,aryuvedic healing ghee
11670,after years of being unable to eat butter due to dairy sensitivities we were delighted to discover pure indian foods organic ghee not only is it packed with nutrition it gives us the opportunity to enjoy the taste of a much missed staple apparently according to nourishing traditions proponents it aids in digestion as well although ghee is often compared to theater popcorn butter we have found the taste of this ghee in particular to be much milder and natural tasting we will definitely keep this stocked,great dairy replacement
11671,this is the first time i buy ghee the service was really fast would buy this brand again great taste texture will not change brand,excellent product
11672,i hardly use butter after trying this stuff i use it for cooking and in my morning bulletproof coffee great flavor great company for offering an organic grass fed product and great service from amazon i would highly recommend this to anyone that is interested,awesome stuff
11673,grass fed ghee by pure indian foods is the best ghee on the market in my opinion it tastes better than the rest and is wonderful to cook with because of it is high heat capability without burning tastes like the butter it is made from without the heavy milk solids,the best ghee around
11674,i have recently been researching the work of dr price and the x factor that high vitamin butter combined with fermented cod liver oil will cause teeth to re mineralize and stop tooth decay if this is why you want to purchase this product do not i am sure it is fine for ghee but when i switched from the pricey butter oil to this i found cavities were growing when i switched back they stopped growing again this is great for ghee but do not use as part of preventing curing tooth decay as dr price research recommends,ok for cooking do not use for preventing cavities
11675,i ordered this ghee after reading ramiel nagel cure tooth decay he claims regular use of high vitamin butter oil from grass fed cows feeding on fast growing summer grass not only adds much needed vitamin a to the diet but also adds something he calls the activator x factor or something like that which is supposed to cause your body to remineralize your teeth nagel recommends a jar of the oil but this ghee seems just as good it is organic high in fat soluble vitamin a and delicious it is also from cows fed on that fast growing grass and it has the warm yellow coloring to prove its vitamin content it feels good to eat unlike regular butter this stuff reminds my tummy of a kind of nutrition it has wanted for years but did not know how to ask for this is the kind of nutrition the healthy rural swiss praised the lord for points from me and it is way less than,amazingly yummy
11676,i am the kind of person who eats to live rather than living to eat so i give a lot of thought to what i am eating and why i eat a little ghee daily with organic honey bee pollen propolis and royal jelly i used to use the purity farms brand organic ghee but find that this one has a much better flavor and texture i think this is due to it being pasture fed and non homogenized which is probably not true for the other product it is a bit more expensive but the benefits of grass fed cannot be overstated when it comes to ghee the only other ghee i would recommend is ancient organics which is also prepared in the traditional way but it is a bit more expensive than this brand ghee is also one of the only oils i would recommend using for cooking as it does not change its composition when heated a little every day can make a big difference in health over time,one of the best ghee products available
11677,we have been following primal blueprint for almost two months and it was recommended by mark to get grass fed butter and ghee my husband and i had never had ghee and are extremely pleased with this product smells and tastes delicious like move theater butter and is so good for us too only problem is we ran out too fast great product,fantastic
11678,like my title says this is the best ghee on the market it is fantastic grass fed organic what more could you ask for oh right it is delicious,best ghee on the market
11679,i originally ordered this product because of a dr oz episode in which a naturalist stated ghee could be used to cure dry noses i know it sounds funny but its true before i ordered it i did not realize what ghee actually was once we received are very timely shipment of ghee i put it in the kitchen cabinet and waited for a first use my husband had run out of coconut oil which we do most of our cooking with and so he turned to the ghee and we have not turned back the flavor is amazing and it is good for you particularly i really like this seller of ghee because it is natural and grassfed good work,exactly as described
11680,i am so glad i started using this butter to cook with it just makes anything taste great the flavor is really buttery baking is also fantastic i think it adds moisture and a wonderful texture to foods a must have in any pantry and it does not need refrigeration so it always ready to use and easy to spread,fantastic butter
11681,this is a good quality ghee i have tried another brand and it had an odd aftertaste but not this one this one is good enough to eat with a spoon if you wanted to mmmmmmmm,great ghee
11682,i love love love this stuff the company is very good about quality and the cows are grassfed i use it for everything is it pricy yes but worth it i am currently out of the country and can get quality butter anywhere but thank god i packed this ghee with me i am so thankful for quality products like this,love this ghee
11683,this is a high quality ghee superior tasting and above all made from grass fed cows milk and certified organic by the usda br we use it over lentils eggs sauteed veggies quinoa rice you name it and we use it tried it on whole grain toast too yummy being from grass fed cows milk it is rich in clas and boosts immunity and energy and is known to fight and obesity especially trimming the waistline this is my second time buying this and i am a consumer for life i also introduced it to my friends and they are digging the taste br i really hope amazon continues to sell this product prime delivery really makes it all the more special br please try it for getting healthier and also the incredible taste highly recommended,excellent quality best source of clas out there
11684,this ghee is delicious a little goes a long way because of the intensity of flavor it imparts wonderful aroma to vegetable dishes and does not burn easily like butter highly recommended,delicious
11685,span class tiny length mins br br span additionally br doesn t state grass fed but i am not so sure such a products exists this product is certainly the best alternative,superb quality delicious ghee
11686,this specific ghee product has a wonderful flavor it is great added to scrambled eggs and makes for the best popcorn along with powdered sea salt add a couple of spoonfuls to a saut eacute pan and try lightly browning asparagus tips very convenient to use just keep the jar handy does not have to be refrigerated i bought two jars for free shipping,wonderful flavor

11689,span class tiny length mins br br span here my video review of pure indian foods ghee it is delicious and i bet you will love it making ghee can be tough so having premade ghee is key in a healthy lifestyle,best ghee on the planet
11690,i recieved this ghee right away and came safely packaged i love that it is grass fed and organic very important to my family we use this with stir fry and saut eacute ing and cannot wait to try on our popcorn delicious ghee,great ghee
11691,i ordered this ghee for my family while we work at improving our dental health and overall health it is very tasty and the kids love it on toast it also came really fast which was nice i will be ordering more,great product
11692,very expensive and not worth the price try purityfarm organic ghee it is much cheaper and taste much better than this ghee do not waste your money,very expensive there are cheaper and better ghee than this one
11693,cannot detect any difference from other ghees also their supposed free sample is not really they ship a tiny jar in a box through the mail and it costs about in postage something for the box and it costs you br br very disappointed they should reconsider doing that because it taints all of their offerings,not special
11694,the first time i tried moonstruck chocolates i was hooked these are the very best chocolate truffles i ordered the truffle box and it arrived quickly everyone should try a moonstruck chocolate it is really a treat,moonstruck chocolates
11695,nothing is better then a gluten free pretzel that taste like a pretzel this is one of the few that are out there that actually taste like a pretzel and if you are like me that matters,wow cannot be beat
11696,the popcorn was great everyone commented on how good it was and how it really tasted like movie theatre popcorn i received it quickly and intact,good stuff
11697,orville is the best microwave popcorn you can buy in my opinion the price is outstanding from amazon and we have compared it all around at various stores almost all the kernels pop and we love the movietheatre butter flavor br cannot go wrong with this purchase,awesome popcorn
11698,this is delicious popcorn it is buttery without being too butter heavy very little old maids very light and easy to eat,great popcorn
11699,i have tried several different brands of microwave popcorn and i think this is the best by far great flavor very few seeds after popping and not greasy,orville redenbacher mtb
11700,overall the bags of popcorn were just like those that you would get in a regular package of or bags however several bags did not pop correctly or at all and had to be thrown out also many other bags would have a burnt hole after popping i realize that some of this variability could be due to microwave wattage but it was only bags from this large box of orville redenbacher that would do this i think when you order such a large box your chances of getting dud bags increase just something to keep in mind is it worth it to buy in bulk when more of the bags will be duds,hit or miss
11701,i love orville redenbacher and so i ordered a case unfortunately it looks old and the bags are weeping butter the popcorn tastes ok when it does fully pop if you can get pass that what am i saying buy the pack and try it out first,popcorn
11702,this is by far the best oatmeal i have ever put in my mouth lots of texture and most importantly delicious my fav is usually just mccains irish oats this far exceeds that you wont be disappointed with this if you love oatmeal,most delicious oatmeal
11703,use as a rub or mix in with canned salmon and mayo for a fast tasty dip great stuff,tasty for salmon
11704,all of my cats including the skittish picky kitten adore these treats my high anxiety kitten hides all of the time and will not eat these same treats in the milk flavor but she always comes out and eats these seafood treats could not be happier,all of my cats love this brand seafood flavor
11705,all our kitties love these treats they come running at treat time it is their favorite treat seafood is a favorite flavor,kitties treat
11706,my cats just love the seafood medley temptations they cannot get enough of them we go through large packs in about weeks we have only cats a year old male and a year old female they will eat only the seafood flavor the male cat will eat only dry food and temptation seafood medley and whatever he can catch outside the female loves can food with gravy dry food and temptations seafood medley she does not hunt anymore but she will eat some of whatever the male catches i will definitely be ordering more thank you for such a good product and very good service i recommend them to my friends with cats,happy cats with temptations
11707,good price free delivery automatic replenishment cats love it it the only reason they come in a fine deal i m a little worried though that they will get tire of this flavor maybe another option with mixed flavors,all around great
11708,the product came at the end of august with expiration date of as a result i could not eat it just waist of money,came expired
11709,this is pure decadence sophisticated delight i had no problems with the delivery either one have to be into marzipan if you dont know or tasted marzipan before try it first on inexpensive kind this is the ultimate for me,pure decadence
11710,what a great deal i live in an area where you can almost never get what you want in the size you want when you want so when there is a good deal i get it then i discovered amazon grocery omg i love it cases o food at amazing prices anyway this peanut oil is wonderful great size bottle for every day use excellent,peanut oil
11711,add cup to cups of raw peanuts in a food processor and make homemade peanut butter grind till smooth add cup sugar and a tsp of salt if you prefer,good buy for the money
11712,bought this at ralphs for to try and was unimpressed the high protein is great but you can find that in other grocery store products the high fiber is great for diets and you cannot find this high in any other pasta but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids it definitely tastes and feels better than some healthy pastas available but i am just not sold on this if you want low net carbs and that is your main goal definitely use this and add in meats veggies and cheese to your dish for a good meal,does not taste bad but does not impress
11713,i can just look at a carb and i gain weight this product allows me to eat pasta and not get all the high impact carbs on my blood sugar grams of fiber is outstanding unlike the other reviewer i think it tastes really good the texture is a little more chewy and thick but again this is something i like i dont miss white pasta at all when i eat this,a great option for low carb diets
11714,caramilk bars are soooo good one of the pleasures of visiting canada is getting yourself these caramilk bars along with aero and kit kat they are top of the line br br if you happen to have read the article from the food dining section of the new york times dated july you will agree that british chocolates and their commonwealth brethren are da best,yummy better than the best american chocolate
11715,ok i have to admit i was very skeptical on how good this chocolate was my wife had served a mission in canada and she said this was the best chocolate so i had to try it well she was right again not only was the chocolate good but the deliver was great also we received ours before they said they would get it to us great service you have to just try these,best chocolate ever
11716,both previous reviewers rated this very low b c they claim these drag eacute es cause cancer not true they may be referring to the silver or gold drag eacute es that are not longer available in ca b c the fda ruled that b c there is trace amount of metal they must state it is for decoration only though people have been eating these for centuries you get more metal in tap water and cooking in pans than from the few cookies you eat decorated with these during occassional celebrations btw the ca law can be traced to one lawyer who made this his sole platform google it br these pearl drag eacute es are perfectly safe and do not fall under the same fda restrictions and are still available in most baking supply shops who ve pulled the metallic ones off their shelves just avoid legal trouble while those who are looking for this product will probably already know this those who are exploring new ideas for decorating will benefit from learning the truth the only reason i do not rate this higher is b c of shipping rates happy baking,this does not cause cancer do your own research
11717,very beautiful and added a wonderful appearance to some of our christmas cookies tasted good as well with no bitter or chemical flavor a good alternative to all the frosting that is popular these days on cookies,beautiful and good tasting
11718,i received this item and there was a tear in the packaging which had caused the dragees to spill all over the inside of the box they arrived in this is not very surprising due to the type of plastic it is packaged in the sort which immediately rips open at the slightest puncture but as such it should have been packaged for shipping more carefully perhaps wrapped it in small bubble wrap and taping it securely as i have seen done with other less fragile items i have ordered i was especially annoyed however that there is no way of returning it that is just outrageous very very dissatisfied i have now tried ordering similar pearl dagrees from wilton a href http www amazon com gp product b n st u wilton sugar pearls white oz a which incidentally are less than half the price br br i should say that generally my experience with amazon and returns has been excellent the few dragees left in the package were beautiful uniform in shape and tasty i view this as an isolated incident due to the particular characteristics of this product its packaging however it could have been handled better,arrived open damaged and was not allowed to return exchange
11719,i cannot find dragees cheaper anywhere else these are the exactly the same you would buy at a craft store for allot more,great deal good quality
11720,why in the world would amazon want to sell an item and say can be ingested when it clearly has ingredients that can cause cancer wish every state would wake up like california and ban all these cancer causing things,can cause cancer why this can not be ship to california
11721,there is a warning for this package that it has things in it that cause cancel why would you put cancer in your food,causes cancer
11722,when pet promise a safe and healthy pet food went out of business i was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by products rendered fats meat meals or outsourced ingredients you might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include if your stomach can take it but avoid commercial manufacturers spins on this good books to get in this regard are foods pets die for and protect your pet br a href http www amazon com gp product food pets die for shocking facts about pet food a br a href http www amazon com gp product protect your pet more shocking facts a br br my cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of which killed many pets especially cats because their pet promise food was one of the few brands in america that did not use outsourced ingredients and was never on the recall list unlike some of the very expensive premium brands i felt so lucky that i had already switched to pet promise a petfood company that bought ingredients only from north american farmers using sustainable agriculture and free range livestock br br i finally discovered halo products and was encouraged by the fact that ellen degeneres a devout animal lover herself not only endorses it but also has become part owner of the company their website also included a specific message written to us former pet promise users so i went to my health food store and bought some br br i was delighted to see that it had no by products no rendered meats no meat meals and that the label stated that all its ingredients are made in the usa except the pea protein from canada furthermore the salmon in halo is wild alaskan not farmed salmon aka pharmed salmon full of antibiotics etc moreover it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix making it even more promising than pet promise br br but the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not unlike my dachshunds who would eat just about anything that hit the floor they re really low to the ground you know cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits but they love it cannot get enough so i have to dole it out so they do not overeat and after five months their health and energy seem to be great br br oh and hi ellen and many thanks,my cats love this very healthy food
11723,after finding out what horrors i would been perpetrating on my kitties with their expensive premium pet food i set out to find something that was not full of by products and unnecessary corn ingredients halo spot spew definitely fit that bill and their ingredients are probably the best you will find in a cat food my cats however were not as impressed as i was and turned their noses up at their new food they did eat it but clearly were not enthused br although i like the human grade ingredients used in halo foods i do wish they used more meat sources there are only a couple protein sources in the food and as a result the protein content of spot stew around is also a little lower than what i would like br overall however this is definitely a great food to feed your pets though if you have a cat that is a finicky eater or that needs a high protein food halo spot stew may not be for you,cats do not seem to go wild for it
11724,i switched my cat to halo salmon indoor formula and have noticed a marked difference in her coat and reduced smell from the litter box br br cats are snobs when it comes to food switching them to a new food takes at least a week more if you have a picky eater like me start small and work more in each day if you moved from a diet of raman noodles to a high protein high fiber diet instantly you would not want to eat it either you get what you pay for when you buy food for yourself or your pet,fantastic for kitty energy and coat the key is introduction of new food
11725,great dry cat food will definitely buy it again for my cat he loved it and never got tired of it,will buy again
11726,my cats love this cat food i am very pleased with all the varities it is very healthy much more than the artificially colored store brands that made one of my cats throw up when he ate it their coats have become very shiney very impressice cat food highly recommend,great cat food
11727,i like the idea of getting grains out of cat food but using peas instead does not seem to be the answer carnivores at least my cat does not tolerate peas vomiting began in about weeks and is now instantaneous eat some cat food go right to throwing up both chicken and salmon so for me it was a waste of money and very disappointing,causes vomiting
11728,my cats love this food i have been buying the pound bag but with cats i will be switching to the larger bag i am glad that halo is available on amazon which makes it very convenient to order but i also wish that more stores would start to carry this brand as well i am always looking for the best for my babies and as far as i can tell this is it,best all natural dry cat food
11729,i am not sure if my cat loves halo but whenever i try to change brands my cat looks happier going back to halo like other reviewers the poop seems to be least smelly also one noticeable difference when i feed halo is that my cat seems to eat in a controlled manner eats throughout the day i guess that is a good thing when i feed other brands my cat eats it uncontrollably all at once,my cat likes it and so i am happy
11730,unfortunately my dear sweet cat did not think this food was so dear or sweet she only ate it when she knew there would be nothing else and she never finished what i gave her she normally eats every single bite of her food but constantly turned her nose up at this she really enjoys bench field holistic natural feline formula from trader joe and also purina naturals cat chow sorry halo i really wanted her to like this,my kitty thought no so good
11731,i bought a couple of flavors from halo both were not a hit with my cats unfortunately my cats would not touch it,disappointed
11732,my little beasts love this stuff i have tried this turkey and salmon all get paws up love the packaging and if smell is any indication this must be good and healthy for my cats some cat food really smells like cat food this doesn t the little girl kitty loves the smaller morsels so she is eating more i had been using iams and although it is great also she had a hard time chewing the bigger pieces thanks amazon for carrying this brand it may be a bit more expensive but i notice i am not filling the litter bowl as much my little girl kitty is putting on some much needed weight but i am not buying cat food as often with this brand,this is the one
11733,i used to chew this gum all of the time my g ma had over packets of it in her basement it tastes so good when i was young i would eat little chicklet at a time the flavor does not last that long but it tastes amazing when it does,great gum
11734,loved them product shipped super fast really a throw back treat the flavor does not last long but they are addicting,classic candy gum very nostalgic
11735,the grand children love them it is a great way to keep them entertained and behaved cuz they know they will get a treat from grandma,yummy
11736,this tiny chiclets are very addicting since i use the subscribe and save i never seem to run out i love grabbing a pack and eating the whole thing at once yummy,addicting gum
11737,my daughter daughter is turning and wanted a bubble gum theme of course my daughter remembered growing up as well as i with the tiny size chiclets we looked everywhere and found them on amazon we were thrilled and purchased several packs to introduce it to the year old and bring back wonderful memories of chiclets gum still the same wonderful product that is always was,chiclets memory
11738,eat your heart out godiva br br be envious ghiardelli br br an old childhood fave of the better br br made her more koo kee br br than ko ko poofs br br she was delighted if your sweet tee is a gum conisseur br br grab her a counter box br br the box works too br br fires up the inner kid in a candy store br br in her br br remind her to share br br a pinch buys new friends br br all day long br br use like soft or street money br br worx me,wife went lunar
11739,it taste okay but they are not soft and the taste does not stay very long i would not buy them again,chiclets
11740,i have use this product for years came across the product on the east coast was hard to find on the west coast but with the internet the world has become smaller thanks to amazon i can continue to enjoy the product this product is a thicker syrup than any other on the market i have yet to find another equal to it,willibee king syrup
11741,i have used this product for the last plus years it has been used by my family br for generations i have recently tried other products that have taken this out of their br product and the taste is not the same i will not give up the satisfaction of enjoying br the best flavor for some health nut opinion that it is not good for you also the br reason i buy this online when i came from the east coast i found that i could not get br this product in the stores here on the west coast it was really a blessing to realize br that i did not have to give it up or have family send it to me,why listen to people about not using fructose corn syrup
11742,i was raised in the east having this syrup on pancakes and just plain bread still the beat around i only wish i could get it in az the shipping is more than the syrup,great syrup
11743,i grew up on king golden syrup back in pennsylvania and have missed it greatly since moving west in until recently i had depended on the generosity br of family members to ship me the occasional bottle which we would then use so sparingly that sometimes i would forget that i had it on the shelf so nice br to find an entire six pack for such an affordable price tiny bit of disappointment when it showed up in plastic dispensers as opposed to the classic glass bottle pictured in the add pleased to announce that the quality was still very very high,king syrup rules
11744,i love king syrup as a child i would visit my grandmother in pa and we would have it for breakfast on buttered toast i always looked forward to my visit because the midwest did not have it it one of those childhood memories that gives you the warm and fuzzies i would be enjoying breakfast while listening to my grandmother tell a story when my family would pack up to return to mo my folks would buy a couple cases of king syrup to hold us over to the next visit to this day i am everytime i eat it i think of her and the wonderful memories a time when things were simpler but good,maple syrup
11745,my mother in law always makes pennsylvania dutch fasnachts doughnuts every year during lent king syrup is the perfect and required accompaniment i am california born and raised but love king syrup and fasnachts,love king syrup
11746,i grew up eating king syrup in delaware and as i moved several times i would always have family and friends bring me a bottle while visiting recently this syrup is no longer available in delaware so i was glad to find it on amazon com although it arrived in plastic bottles instead of the traditional glass bottles the taste quality remains the same i ordered a six pack and only have as family and friends grabbed bottles as i opened the package,a must have
11747,i used to have this syrup at my grandmothers house all the time the product is the same as i always remember it it is a very thick syrup the only complaint i have is that the bottles i used to use it out of were glass and these bottles are plastic no big deal though it does not change the syrup,just as i remember it
11748,i was raised up with king syrup i could not find it until last year my brother lives incalifornia and he could not find it eaither so i mailed him some for xmas this past christmas he loves it as well as my other siblings thank you so very much for abilling me to get some more,king syrup
11749,i grew up using king syrup on biscuits pancakes in pecan pie in pumpkin pie it is the best i used to have my brother send me oz bottles but most stores only carry it in oz bottles one oz is just right for two pies br br my complaint is not with the syrup it is in the way it was shipped i ordered two boxes of each i wanted one for a gift however you sent the bottles in one container the ups man left it on my porch and i could not lift it to get it in the house bad call on your part,best there is
11750,oh my this syrup is devine delicious very thick silky gooey smells so good br i am in love my mom kept this in the cabinet i grew up on this stuff and today i still love it i have to be careful with my weight however there is no syrup in my opinion that compares to king syrup anything you pour it on it just soaks in like a sponge i eat it on hot buttered waffles pancakes i use it to make my thanksgiving marsmallow candied sweet potatoes and my family and friends love it and always asks for more candied sweets my dad before he passed used to eat it on bread biscuits he had a slight sweet tooth and this fixed his craving everytime br you must try this syrup,best syrup ever
11751,i grew up on king syrup in virginia its still the best and still sold in stores in pa and va i have mine and it was great on biscuits been a along time since i had syrup and biscuits with good ol king syrup when i was a kid i called it lion syrup lol,king syrup
11752,for those of us on the west coast carl jr serves king syrup in their syrup packets for french toast,king syrup
11753,i also grew up on the east coast usa where this was and may still be readily available we ate it on pancakes ice cream pumpkin pie mom also used it in baking none other matches the thick richness of this syrup or the taste whenever i have gone back east i have stocked up,the best for cooking and eating
11754,i got this at a great price i paid without subscribe and save for boxes that contain separate oz bags so you see is a whole bunch of cookies i am abroad but i hear that my stepson reaction was wow they will all be gone tomorrow teenager resembles a bottomless pit but it was a very good price cookies are fresh and packaging as appropriate will buy again br btw i just saw that the price on this was my favorite things llc refresh a couple of times till you see fulfilled by amazon com,great price lots of cookies
11755,i had a good experience with other amazon grocery products and these were a good deal so i bought a three pack they were not horrible but they do not taste the same as the ones you buy in the store they taste like cheap generic chocolate chip cookies which is not necessarily bad but not what i expected for the price and chips ahoy brand br br they are cheaper tasting a little stale and much less chocolate chips i have not had store bought chips ahoy for a few months so maybe they changed the formula for all these cookies but if not then these seem to be cheap knock offs made with cheaper ingredients,not like in the store
11756,my kids loves chips ahoy and i will have them once in a while as well but the kids refuse to eat them from this family size package once i tasted them i knew why they have an awful medicinal taste really bad i do not what the problem is but if you like chips ahoy you will not like these go elsewhere,there is something wrong here
11757,first of all the tea is gross it tastes nothing like bubble milk tea secondly the seller must know this product is less than expected because they sell it in incriments of two lb bags now im stuck with two bags lbs of this junk i want my bucks back,does not taste like bubble tea from restaurants
11758,everyone in my house is addicted to this tea we drink it iced make one or two pitchers of it a day it is not sweetened but has a subtle natural sweetness to it feels refreshing and clean it was also one of the few things i tolerated well when i was pregnant and routinely nauseated i have heard this from other mothers too love it,best tea on earth no i do not own company stock
11759,i was introduced to this tea at a local restaurant and went absolutely crazy about it its unique flavor and healthifying blend of green and black teas and yerba mate along with a light touch of ginger is a wonderful thirst quencher as a tonic for health and energy i now find myself drinking it daily instead of my usual afternoon coffee it perks up the body and brain without the jittery effects of caffeine i find i get a delightful pick me up later in the day when i need it without the negative affects of keeping me up at night while a tad expensive i will continue to buy sportea and enjoy its delicious brew it is now a part of my every day routine,a delicious tonic like tea
11760,but very delicious just the same if you are looking for a wee bit of a different flavor in the old favorite oreo this is just what you are looking for love the size of the mini too,very different than the original
11761,little bitz chicken treats are the best treats i have found for my little dog not only are they good for him but he loves them i am so disappointed that the stores where i live stopped carrying them and thrilled to death that i can order them here my chihuahua is very fussy because he is very spoiled these treats are the only ones he will eat plus they are healthy and good for his teeth does not matter if they are round or bone shaped great to use for training,the best dog treat
11762,the only problem i had with these plants were that i ordered six different colour flowers and they were not tagged now i have to wait till they start flowering to see whats what having said that the plants arrived in excellent condition and ahead of schedule with all their leaves intact and still green i have ordered from this supplier again and will do so in the future,plants need to be tagged
11763,very good and quick service my plant arrived just in two days in very good shape and is doing well,desert rose
11764,we have not planted it yet but it is still hanging in there we do water it in the little pot every so often we really need to get it in the ground soon it is very attractive but has just one stem and do not know how to turn it into bonsai look but it has glossy attractive leaves and have not had a bloom yet maybe if i were to get it into the ground it would help,desert rose
11765,when i got it was in amazing condition only problem is it died due to the fact bugs nats flies love this for some odd reason but all n all love the plant will buy from seller again,very good plant
11766,while packages were to be sent out in order only pack was sent out in order but after contacting you and explaining the problem your company fixed it right away after all we all make mistakes thanks for your handling the situation so quickly,there was a problem with the order
11767,is this price correct works out at over a lb i am sorry but for this price i would not buy from this supplier this is just a ridiculous price walnuts can be purchased anywhere for less than per lb,walnuts are good but the price not so much
11768,after reading so many healthy things about walnuts we try to eat some everyday buying them from amazon with our prime shipping is so much cheaper than buying them from our local grocery store nuts keep nicely in the freezer toasting them in a degree oven for minutes makes them taste gourmet ish,walnuts good for you
11769,i love these chopped walnuts i put them in cereal chicken salad and sweet potato casserole to name a few they are good for you also,walnuts are delicious and good for you
11770,i enjoyed these chopped walnuts very much they are fresh and crunchy and are perfect for use in trail mix or as a topping for ice cream yogurt etc br br i like the small eight oz bag it is a very convenient size that does not leave me wondering how to keep a whole pound of nuts fresh if i have to open the bag just to use a few walnuts on my granola in the morning br br however for some uses i e making chunky chocolate chip cookies i have found that the shelled walnuts work much better for me than these chopped walnuts do the small pieces chopped walnuts are really just walnut crumbs seem to blend more into the background of baked goods than the big shelled walnut chunks do br br for that reason i prefer the diamond shelled walnuts to their chopped walnuts however both products are very good,these walnuts are fresh and are chopped to the perfect size for topping ice cream and yogurt etc
11771,these chopped walnuts are just perfect for baking they save a lot of prep time my local super market is always out of stock and they cost more there than they do from this seller they were delivered in only two days very satisfied,love these nuts
11772,i eat a handful of these walnuts daily for omega fatty acids with a diet coke as a great snack i eat bag per week they taste great they always have tasted fresh i empty bag of walnuts in a plastic storeage container either keep it in the fridge or in a kitchen cabinet i am about to order subscribe save to save on my next order i am sure that they would be great for baking as they are nicely chopped,diamnond walnuts chopped ounce bags pack of
11773,this one seems to be flavored more to a cat liking than the rest of the florentine varieties they are expensive so buy one of each to see what floats with your cat but here one will eat this and the other one won t it is gobbled up quite quickly too i might add by one of them so there you go anyway the greens addition is great for cats they seem to like it in their other varieties and they are high on the nutrition scale so if you are looking for higher protein and better nutrition all around be sure to give these a go in our house the pates have fared the best over the shreds and particularly these florentines the egg soufles seem to be the favorites here they hoover them down so fast they barely come up for air recommend,best of the florentines
11774,but fuzzy prefers the salmon primavera to the yellowfin tuna however toto aka totolicious loves it i have to keep writing until i reach,cats love it
11775,this is one of the few products my spoiled brats really appreciate i look for bargains and sometimes i find cheaper elsewhere this product is from petfooddirect com and often they offer coupons through email my kitties only like the elegant medleys and basically refuse all else and they only like a few of these too i am stuck spending all my dough to feed the felines oh well,my cats love this
11776,product is good my cats like it but the price just keeps climbing i will have to train my cats to eat cheaper cat food,inflation
11777,this is a good product the price at amazon is excellent and i really like it just coming to my door subscribe and save is an excellent way to shop,cat food
11778,tuna as is well documented absorb and store mercury in fat anything that eats that fat consumes mercury i would not feed tuna to a child and i would recommend any adult to read the literature regarding mercury content in seafood how can it be safely fed to a cat regarding this brand of cat food it is excellent as long as you feed chicken or turkey,concerned about mercury content
11779,i should bite the bullet and only order this more expensive fancy feast for my cats they all love it it is the sauce there is not any waste setting up autoship assures me that i am getting the best possible price around,cheaper than the store with coupons
11780,this is one of the few cat foods my fussy cat will eat he loves the gravy especially wish they would sell that on it is own and amazon subscribe and save is the best price i can find and so convenient too,yummy for kitty tummy
11781,the garden greens added to this product was the reason i bought it because my cat was trying to eat any twigs she found in my yard in addition to the twigs in trees she climbs my cat was a stray cat who obviously had not been getting a balanced diet i believe the fancy feast florentine style is changing her eating habits because she chews fewer twigs and has begun nibbling on any available green plants,good for my cat
11782,as much as one can tell with cats mine seem to prefer this as their favorite,my cats love it
11783,works well as a rub on chicken br br also adds plenty of flavor when mixed in to meatloaf br br has some smoke not too much fire,great flavor not a killer
11784,this is hard to find on grocery shelves thank goodness mccormick is producing it now i look forward to using it in several recipes br br i bought it for chocolate chile mole brownies which were received with skepticism until tasted then there were rave reviews i have downloaded other dessert recipes using ground ancho chile pepper but in the meantime we have learned it really does a good job of flavoring chili without making it unbearably hot good product,ancho chile pepper
11785,i use this product whan i make honey jalapeno ribs gives a nice mild smoke flavor great price on this also,great flavor
11786,if you love chiles then ancho powder is a must have for any blends you may create i recommend with chipotle powder try different peppers in different amounts for amazing results,good quality fair price
11787,i have seen a lot of popular chefs use this in recipes but could never find it in the stores this goes great in marinades rubs wings spreads etc a great addition to any spice seasoning collection,great flavor hard to find in stores
11788,the problem with ancho chili is its scarcity in commercial markets we do not have ready recourse to a decent mexican mercado a sadness so i turned to amazon there is simply something wonderful combining ancho and maple syrup for a splendid porc chop sauce for example i am grateful so are the happy palates around here,as jumbo plastic jars of ancho go
11789,exactly as advertised plenty of space to set the keurig brewer on top and still fit under a counter top depending on counter top height cups fir in nicely and the drawer is easy to access and see what k cups you may want,k cup holder
11790,it is a nice looking storage option and saves space but i expected the drawer to slide out without so much difficulty it is very jerky and tough to pull out and and push in i thought maybe i did something wrong but it is pretty simple i applied some wd to the slide with much wiping to get the excess off and that did not help br has anyone else had this trouble and were you able to remedy it,attractive but drawer sticks
11791,cost was at time of review only at other sites buy elsewhere sometimes prime is worth paying an extra dollar or two i will be comparison shopping a little more now,over priced on amazon
11792,this sells for at bed bath and beyond add your off coupon and you are good to go br br i also had cabinet issues and returned it to bb b,cheaper in the store
11793,when i received this item i was very disappointed with it it is rather cheap looking and i would not want this on my counter for all to see the left side of the tray was lopsided and looked strange when you pulled it out needless to say i boxed it back up and sent it back for a full refund definitely not worth but after seeing it i would have been equally disappointed had i paid only,poor quality
11794,i purchased this product over a year ago and the best i can say is this is an ok product for me but could be perfect for you br br i used to always reach up to the top shelf grab my box of k cups sift through them to find what i wanted and then make my coffee i tried to use the wooden box but when you can only hold and you use multiple k cups per day i just felt like i was always filling it and didnt have enough room for variety br br i bought this thinking it was perfect holding cups should last me a few weeks minimum the keurig would sit right on top and take up less room what more could i ask for then when i brought it home though the truth came out br br the draw is very well made and works perfect however you are adding about inches to the size of the keurig due to the height of my cabinets it raised the machine just enough to not longer be able to open enough because the handle hits the cabinet for a few days i was pulling it out and using it like that but that got too annoying instead i now use the draw but not with my coffee maker on it it now holds my knife block instead since those can still come out just fine br br if your keurig is set up with no cabinet above it this option is beyond perfect however for me i feel like it just added a bit of clutter but i am willing to deal with it for the convience of the drawer,ok solution depending on your kitchen set up
11795,the drawer fit perfectly and is a real space saver it is just the right size and holds all our coffee choices,wonderful space saver
11796,this is an extremely useful product the only reason it gets out of is i should have looked closer on the dimensions and the width of my cabinets,excellent but
11797,before i begin my review let me say this i read the product specs especially the dimensions br i measured the space i have and armed with that knowledge i ordered the item br br the item is exactly as described and pictured and because i pre measured i knew it would fit unlike other reviewers who apparently could not be bothered and then give it a low rating as a result br br it a simple design and well built it is sturdy enough to hold the weight of my large cuisinart k cup brewer with a full reservoir it is a solid wire frame build and the rails the drawer runs on are part of that wire design the mesh walls are a tad light weight but they are not load bearing and are only meant for aesthetics and to contain the k cups i also store splenda packets in one column of mine br br other than my normal blend i tend to have up to additional flavors for a weekend treat or just to mix it up on occasion keeping these loose on the counter or bouncing around mixed up in a box made it a pain to pick through them but now i keep them in line in the segmented rows in the drawer having a lack of storage space in my cupboards and kitchen drawers makes this the natural and ideal choice br br many have been disappointed that it did not fit but all you need to do is measure your brewer footprint and it is height beneath your cupboards if applicable br br it not a perfect item the mesh could be a tad better grade or the price about lower but otherwise highly recommended purchase,great tray for storing various k cup varieties
11798,i purchased this item and then saw it for less in a big retail store when i contacted amazon i was told that they could not do anything for me and the price i paid was firm i wrote them and told them i was going to return the item and buy it where i had seen it for much cheaper and they just did not care when i asked how much my refund was going to be they told me approximately more than what they had credited me for i do not like to be deceived and i thought you get the best prices with amazon but that is not true at all keep checking other places before you purchase from amazon and there customer service stinks in my opinion furthermore i received my item from the other place and i love it,unhappy with purchase
11799,so i bought the coffee pod drawer thinking it was the answer to my cluttered coffee area on my kitchen counter not exactly first and foremost let me say this is a great product it does hold the pods neatly it has a nice durable slip resistant top that lets you feel comfortable that your keurig will not slip or tip over this is why i gave the product stars br my issue is this i purchased this simply because i thought it would use up less space on my counter if my k cups were stored inside this drawer and underneath my keurig as opposed to my somewhat bulky k cup carousel which by the way is chrome and i really despise chrome anyways what i did not consider was the fact that it raises your keurig up by about inches before i bought this drawer my keurig had just enough space on the counter under the cupboard that it sits under for me to lift the top of the keurig open to put new k cups in and to fill the water etc that additional inches really makes a difference i can no longer open the top of the keurig all the way without banging the cupboard we all know that you do not need to open it all of the way but when that is what you were used to doing well you can understand i pretty much bang the cupboard every day now another drawback to the idea of purchasing this soley to save space is that you cannot keep anything in front of the drawer since obviously you need to open the drawer to get the k cups out i used to keep the coffee condiments in front of my keurig and now i can t br br here the bottom line this is a great product in the sense that it gets the carousel if you have one off your counters but i would only buy this if you have ample clearance above your keurig now to be able to still lift the top open once you set this up and you do not need to use the space in front of the drawer br br happy coffee drinking br br update br almost a year later i am still using the storage drawer yes from time to time i forget and still whack the cupboard but the keurig and the cupboard are no worse for the wear i still keep my eye out for better storage solutions and none have really looked like they would be any better while the product is well made and has been durable still looking practically new and is heavily used in my kitchen i still think it is a bit pricey for what it is i just checked online and it still ranges from to i am hoping that nobody pays for this when you can get it for plus use a coupon for off at bed bath and beyond br of all the reviews i have written on amazon this one seems to bring some not so nice comments from people which is kind of odd to me but everyone is entitled to their own opinion i still hold firm at stars as i mentioned in a reply to one comment to me that is a b there is nothing wrong with a b product i think most people that buy this product will be very impressed with it is durability thanks for reading,this is not necessarily a space saver
11800,span class tiny length mins br br span under cabinet clearance when keurig a href http www amazon com gp product b l nvvs keurig coffee pod drawer holder k cup capacity by my perfect kitchen a is sitting on top of pod drawer,nice design but beware of clearance space
11801,i can finally get rid of the five boxes of k cups sitting on my counter the padded top of the drawer shelf means i do not get a rattling vibration noise when the brewer runs and the drawer slide action is very smooth the drawer extends far enough out that it is easy to get the last cup in a row so you can see all the cups at once much better than digging around in a bunch of boxes the whole thing feels very sturdy and has a nice modern look to it,i get my counter space back
11802,this is an excellent k cup storage drawer it holds the cups nicely the drawer is a bit sturdy and supports the weight of the machine it is easy to clean i would definitely recommend this product to a loved one however i would also recommend that they purchase it elsewhere i purchased the exact item at my local bb b for this past sunday that is almost half price,bed bath and beyond has it cheaper
11803,where do you put your k cups right f ing here that is where br br this thing is solid and does not slide around on the counter top plus it is sturdy enough to handle the platinum keurig without issue and it looks saucey too br br i only gave it stars as the slider tray was is a little bent only noticeable if you are right up next to it definitely not the packaging or shipping damage looks like it came from the factory this way br br also since its of stock from this store you can find it at bed bad beyond for,what can i say this thing rocks
11804,terrible clunky product drawer does not open close without making clunky noises not a space saver hard on the eyes would return it for a refund if i were not terribly lazy go to bed bath and beyond and use a off coupon for something else not worth it,not for us better off with a different product
11805,i store my mugs creamer splenda packets and napkins on top of this and just love it my coffee maker is next to it it like my little coffee station i did not buy it here though because it is cheaper at bed bath beyond shipping here it is i am gonna get a nd one to stack on top of my first and then put the same stuff i had on it back on top i recommend this stackable drawer type unit br br,love it
11806,first off i very much prefer this look to the rotating holders plus it holds more k cups than they do i also like that it takes up less storage space than those carousels plus a machine i have limited counter top space and it is already crowded br a minor issue as i had read before was that the added height to the machine causes lid to hit the cupboards while opening and closing i am ok with pulling it away from the wall a bit and will eventually place my machine in a more open counter space to avoid this it does bother my husband more though br i was disappointed with the product a bit my main problem was the material on the top of the drawer that you rest the machine on was not done very aesthetically as soon as i opened what stood out to me was that it had to have been hand cut and was cut slightly wrong on my product first i can still see the pencil mark all across the front then it was cut too short and coroner was not cut squarely it happens to h ave also been across the front edge of my product so it just sticks out to me and lessens it is appeal br i find the drawer to operate smoothly and easily you can not reach the back row of k cups while full but that is not a big deal to me at all,was expecting better quality for the price but love the storage
11807,this drawer is fabulous and holds a ton of kcups it does make the machine too tall for low hanging cabinets however it saves on total counter space needed versus a carousel and looks great it is very sturdy and should last for a long time i have the keurig platinum and have plenty of room to put sugar splenda packets or mugs love it,great
11808,i have one of these and love it but i would never pay this much for it got it a bed bath beyond for and that was not a sale just their regular price,not worth it
11809,i have this drawer and the carousel i find it easier and less cluttered to use the drawer i also have my keurig on top of it with lots of room around it for misc items,glad i got this
11810,this item is great i dont have a lot of counter space in my kitchen or space in my draws to store my k cups so this item was perfect for me it sits right below my keurig i would highly recommend this item a great buy and an awesome space saver,space saver
11811,able to store my coffee right under the machine i still have room on top for my soda maker keurig is a mini br the only thing i do not like is that the pods that are in the back may be a little difficult to get would be better if there was a spring that would push these last pods forward slightly as the others get used other wise much more useful than a carousel br as another reviewer mentioned can get this item for at bed bath and with usual off coupons for even less it also does raise the keurig about from the counter so be sure to have room above the coffee maker as well as on the sides,space saver
11812,as other have mentioned this is available in other stores for much cheaper so i recommend to shop around before buying on amazon br br when it comes to the actual product i highly recommend buying this if you own a keurig you are able to discretly hide so many of the keurig cups the carousel is a neat product but when you do not have counter space it just does not work br br this unit is pretty great quality but i do find that it is tough to slide sometimes the material that they use on the top of the tray makes sure that your keurig does not move at all br br highly recommend that you pick one up whether it be from bbb or amazon,fantastic product but way too expensive on amazon
11813,i have a rather small kitchen and a tower type holder would take up too much counter space this holder is perfect for me the rubberized top holds my keurig plus a sugar dispenser a bowl of sweet n low and a tall shot glass with coffee stir sticks very convenient and the drawer slides out easily to hold k cups i am thinking of getting a nd one and stacking them so that i have room for cups clearance above my keurig is good br br stars for price at i had to really think about it for a bit but it works better for me than the cheaper options would so i am happy with the purchase,nicely made works great
11814,like a lot of people i have very limited kitchen space and my keurig brewer itself takes up an entire countertop i was never able to fit one of the traditional revolving k cup stands in my kitchen so i generally leave my k cup boxes on top of the refrigerator not very tidy and a little inconvenient but the best i could do i was thrilled to find this holder at the store where it cost about beware some of these amazon seller prices and bought it immediately it is perfect it holds k cups at a time so i can stock it and put the k cups away in the closet for a few weeks until i start running low it also complements my black and silver brewer nicely it is very stable and has a no slip top so you do not have to worry about your keurig tipping over it does add about inches of height so make sure you have enough clearance if your brewer is under a cupboard highly recommended,the perfect counter space solution
11815,plain and simple all you have to do is buy this drawer and set your coffee maker on top of it and you are done easy to get your k cups whenever brewing coffee right at your fingertips,very neat drawer for you coffee maker
11816,great way to stock your k cup assortment without having to take up extra counterspace w another item such as the carousel or tower units offered if your kitchen is small,great organizer without needing extra space
11817,item appears to be keurig brand by title description big however upon receiving it it is an off brand my perfect kitchen sold at bed bath beyond and at half the price i was disappointed in the jading and sent it back signed up for bbb email promos and got a off coupon for use in the store so i bought this exact item for reg only in store i mean exact do your homework and save yourself some money oh and the item itself is great we have the larger platinum b and it does have an issue with the cupboards but i just pulled it forward about in and it is perfect i am fortunate enough to have a lot of counter space and i may move it to an open top area so for us it is all good,overpriced off brand
11818,this is a great product however it is only about at bed bath and beyond and if you look in the sunday paper always a off coupon,much cheaper at bed bath and beyond
11819,the keurig storage drawer is a perfect match for the coffee maker the coffee machine sits perfectly on the top and makes getting the refills soooo easy br i looked at other storage options but i found this to be ideal really glad i bought it,perfection
11820,i was ready to buy one of the carousel type k cup storage devices when i saw this one br it is a bit exepnsive but it preserves counter space and keeps the k cups right there br i also use it to store the ez cup reusable system,save counter space
11821,this was a gift for our daughter she loves it since it holds more cups than the carousel she loads in her favorites in the front part and less used flavors in the rear the only drawback might be is that if your cabinets hang low over your countertop you may have difficulty with the added inch or two in height since the brewer sits on top of the drawer,excellent product
11822,ordered this on the advice of the single serve coffee forum br br cons br br drawer is metal mesh on metal mesh so it does not slide smoothly it is pretty clunky to pull open and even harder to close br it does not pull out far enough to reach the back of the drawer so you have to tip the final k cup out which is hard if you have an entire coffee maker on top br again all mesh so the cups do not sit smoothly in the tray and the sections are a hair too narrow so the cups brush one another awkwardly br my upper cabinets are raised higher than average because we are both tall and this still did not leave us enough room to open the maker while on the drawer br br pros br br for our modern kitchen it is nice to look at br it comfortable fits my capresso frothpro on one side and two oz ghirardelli bottles front to back on the other so it still saves us counter space br when i tried my keurig on it i expected some buckling but it seemed to stand firm even with a full water tank br br all in all for it is a lot nicer to look at than the spinning barrel style holders and i do not need my coffee to be on display plus it looks easy to clean which for me is a plus,it is ok i guess
11823,i love this drawer my keurig cuisinart coffeemaker fits on it perfectly it holds k cups so i always have many options for hot beverages right where i need them i think it looks great and the drawer slides in and out very easily do not know how they could have made this simple item any better,perfect k cup storage solution
11824,i just got a keurig for my mom who is and disabled it is so much easier now for her to get her cup of coffee and tea i read over many reviews to decide whether to buy the carousel or this storage drawer i finally decided on this for the space saving design it was the right choice it is sturdy durable and somewhat attractive it slides out smooth and quiet and holds a nice amount of cups it pulls out far enough so you can see the cups far in the back of the drawer i am hoping that they will make one that has drawers one on top of the other so i could store more cups at a time this is not beautiful if your looking at the aesthetic value of it but works for what it is intended for,really nice
11825,when i first purchased my keurig coffee maker i could not decide how to store the k cups i did not want to give br up my counter space for the carousel i settled for a flat holder that with open compartments and could be br put in a drawer or attached to the wall i did not want to spend the extra few dollars for this drawer type br after shifting that one around from drawer to balanced against the wall i finally gave in and went for this great holder that allows the keurig to sit on top and now i have my counter space back and a nice neat area for my br keurig i hope that i can save someone some time and money by letting you know about my experience,tried others and this is the best
11826,storage drawer is very handy to keep under the keurig instead of having sevaral boxes of k cups it is sturdy however one of the adhesive foot pads came off just stuck it back on from moving the whole thing back and forth to open the pod lid wide enough,convenient
11827,a birthday gift to myself my hubby gave me the keurig for christmas and i was having a hard time storing all my flavors of the k cups i love this for you pull it out and there they are flavors and all good construction too and it all fits under my cabinet with room to open and fill the reservoir,love it
11828,drawer is much larger than it appears in photo and takes up much more space on the cabinet surface the drawer is sticky and not easily opened or closed i would not purchase again,keurig storage drawer
11829,bought this as a gift for my mom because she loved mine it arrived very quickly and was just what she wanted thanks,great item
11830,first off i am very happy that my keurig coffeemaker sits nicely atop this storage drawer without having to take up any extra counter space but on the other hand it is difficult to reach the last k cup in the very back of the drawer i can live with it but they should have designed it so the drawer extended out a bit more for easy access,nice but has it is short comings
11831,the slots wernt exactly evenly spaced and its a bit stiff to pull out push in but bottom line it works and looks good for the price cannot beat it,nice
11832,the keurig fits nicely on top of the drawer the drawer opens and closes with ease it organizes your k cups and saves counter shape,nice
11833,my daughter has and enjoys this storage drawer based on her recommendation i ordered it and am very glad i did it looks nice holds a lot of cups and is very convenient highly recommend,a very handy spacesaver
11834,i decided to fasten it under our cabinet to save more space it is very sturdy well made and works great,storage dawer
11835,love this it saves space and looks great i had to move the brewer out a litle bit from under my cabinets to be able to open the top but otherwise no problem there is even enough room on top of the drawer to put my sweetener in a small holder,looks so great on my countertop
11836,i love that this drawer holds so many k cups its great to have them right under the machine its great for those times when i am having company i can load it up with what i know they like each time someone different comes over i can just simply put their choices in the drawer and they can make a fresh beverage any time they want they dont need to dig in my pantry or come get me to make something for them handy to have i love it,k cup drawer
11837,my husband drilled some extra holes and mounted it under a cabinet it holds more than my carousel and you can see all the flavors at once the hard mesh sides and front allows you to easily check the coffee supply without opening the drawer there were no sharp edges on the metal looks like it will hold up well a good value for the money,practical space saver
11838,my order arrived quickly and was packaged well and well worth the price i like it better than the stand up k cup holder because this goes right under the coffee maker and does not take up extra space the drawer slides in and out smoothly too,i like it
11839,i do not know if i have bad one doubt it but it does not slide well unless you lift up on it it is like the tracks are too tight and if you try pulling straight out it hangs and then the cups inside go flying when it finally does slide because you end up jerking it,space saver does not slide well
11840,i bought this for my office it was perfect because it fits just right on the mini fridge with room for my mugs on the side we love it because you can now see what to pick from when before we were going through boxes of k cups,perfect for small office
11841,this drawer is very sturdy as long as it is on a flat surface and holds plenty of k cups it is great because it does not use your counter space and even with my heavy cuisinart k cup coffee maker on top it still slides in and out very easily love it,exactly what i wanted
11842,i had been frustrated trying to figure out how to store the k cups on my counter top the carousals were not only spendy but took up too much space i love this product yes it does raise my machine up but is not that to be expected when it goes under the machine i get a kick out of people putting down a product when it is exactly as described and the reviewer did not have the foresight to see this besides mine does not sit under the cupboard so its not a problem the drawer slides easily and the top does not sag or buckle under the weight it is perfect for my limited space i would like to find one just like this one but a little smaller for my smaller machine at work,loving it
11843,the product arrived quickly it was just perfect and although it says it holds k cups it actually holds more if you turn every other one upside down we have our coffee maker sitting on top and just love the convenience of the coffee right there thanks for a great product,excellent
11844,i received the keurig k cup shelf and it is a perfect addition to the keurig coffee maker and allows you to have or so k cups nearby without having to look at them like you would have with the k cup tree,keurig k cup holder
11845,sturdy well made convenient fits well under the keurig machine and does not take extra space easy pull out drawer to view coffee choices,it is what it is
11846,this drawer is just awesome for holding the k cups when the boxes get nearly empty and it seems pointless to store them on the shelf it keeps the k cups nice and dry and handy best of all is that the machine can rest safely on the top giving it it is own little area in the kitchen kind of like a little break room we love this and the shelf we bought to hang on the wall to hold the boxes,ha this thing is awesome
11847,ordered both had bent tracks and i actually cut my finger on one of the wires sticking out but you get what you pay for,get what you pay for
11848,works great definitely worth the i read another review that the drawer sticks i ran into this problem also easy fix just bend the sides of the pull out drawer in with a little bit of pressure i was afraid that i might break it but it seems to be very sturdy like i said just a little bit of pressure the drawer slides out no problem believe me if it had issues i would never hear the end of it from my wife also i have my keurig b on top of it with no issues of bowing there is enough room on the side to fit some containers creamer sugar makes the counter top a lot more functional,great k cup drawer
11849,this is very sturdy and not as some reviews were that stated this was flimsy br i have no issues with it at all and would highly recommend it to anyone of my friends,better than expected
11850,looks good but does not open and close smoothly the drawer has medal feet that fit into a groove in the bottom of the unit as a track the tray sticks a lot and you have to hold the top of the unit to jerk the drawer out,looks good but does not open and close smoothly
11851,my order was processed quickly and arrived on time slide it out of the box and set it in place now everything is at my finger tips,fast easy
11852,good solid product saves room when storing your k cups one thing to check is the space under your cabinet my keurig is on my kitchen counter and i had to pull it out from under the cabinet since the tray would not open with the extra height,cescob
11853,this item works out great keeps everycup of coffee at your fingertips and definitely looks good sitting on my unclutterd counter quick ship aaaa,nice rack
11854,great storage for coffee and space saver may purchase another to stack them as we have enough space under cabinet,space saver
11855,this is an attractive way to store all those k cups and they are right under the machine never lost or mixed up the shelf pretty much matches any decor and the drawer does not rub or stick i love it,convenient and attractive storage
11856,i have never taken the time to write a review before but in this case others need to be warned off i expected to get a product similar to what i have seen in the stores but this obviously is a replica the sliders on the bottom of the tray that are supposed to keep the tray straight when you slide it in and out broke off before i even got it out of the package it is not something you can fix unless you have a solder gun even then it is very sticky pulling the tray out because there are no rollers it is metal on metal which does not work well without some sort of lubrication i love amazon but this product is inferior at best,fell apart
11857,this product is well worth the money others carry a similar product that is cheaper but the quality is way cheaper also,great product even for the higher price
11858,i am giving this stars not because it fits the way it should but because i love it where i put it first this does not fit under my keurig properly my lid to the keurig will not open all the way if this sits under the machine this is a quality piece it does not feel flimsy or a crappy build the drawer works smooth with no problems the k cups fit perfectly the reason i love it is i had my husband drill a few holes and mounted it under my counter in the corner where the cupboards meet i uploaded two pictures under images for you to see what i mean this works great as an under the counter holder i warn you measure your cupboards first some of my cupboards were not deep enough to install this as an under counter product however the corner where my cupboards meet worked super i love that it is off my counter but it actuallly looks nice and keeps all the cups in a space that is easy to use and does not take up precious counter space in my small kitchen,stars but here is why
11859,nice storage drawer matches nicely in my kitchen only drawback is i cannot store it under the coffee maker due to not be able to open the keurig dispenser so i store it under my toaster other than that it is really nice,i wished it fit under the coffee pot
11860,i bought this one until i saw one exactly like it at a big box store think red bullseye for this is going back,half the price elsewhere
11861,i have been looking at this holder since i saw it at the at my office today i found it at bb b for it works great but too expensive at amozon,great product buy it at bed bath beyond
11862,if you like gadget this is one more to add to your collection br it works and fits nicely on a counter top you can then br put the machine on top of this drawer saving space br it glides smoothly,nice
11863,coffee maker nicely stacks on top of drawer saving counter space br i bought two since i keep a wide variety of k cups br however i purchased mine at bed bath and beyond for about half the price,handy organizer
11864,i was not particularly happy with the storage drawer as it is made of wire and the cups do not sit in it flat,keurig k cup storage drawer and twinings english breakfast tea k cups
11865,works well with my keurig cofee maker always have k cups handy uses less space than the other types of holders glad i ordered this item,krurig k cup storage drawer coffee holder for k cups
11866,i use my storage drawer for my assorted k cups and my keurig sits atp the storage drawer it has an easy clean top and is attractive and practical,k cup storage stand for coffee brewer
11867,we love this tray it is very sturdy and holds just enough k cups i would recommend this to everyone,great product
11868,i purchased this storage drawer so that i could better organize my mass of k cups it currently sits underneath my keurig it looks very nice and does what it is supposed to it is a simple design and while it does not save a lot of room it does not take up much room either,very stylish
11869,tray fits perfectly under the coffee maker color compliments color of coffee maker non skid top keeps coffee maker in place drawer is ventilated ample storage space love it,keurig coffee tray
11870,i love products that reduce clutter are functional and do not hurt your eyes to look at i really like this drawer i have it beneath my cuisinart keurig k cup mini brewing system it is sturdy enough to hold the coffee maker this is a product i would highly recommend,so handy
11871,a wonderfully ingenious way to keep all your k cups in one place without taking up extra counter space keeps several different types of my favorite coffee i love it,best k cup storage unit
11872,what a great idea i hated wasting a whole drawer with my various k cup boxes tea cider coffees etc i thought about the carousels but did not like the idea of having it on my counter i wanted something that was more discreet and space saving br br more discreet yes br it looks nice and you cannot even tell what is in it br br space saving yes br my keurig b fits perfectly on it br br i hate having cluttered looking counter tops this drawer allows me to store my cups neatly in a unit that looks nice i also love how it has dividers for each row to allow you to organize your k cups you cna slo pull the drawer out pretty far so that you can see all of your k cups i also love that i get my drawer where my k cups were previously stored back br br i do wish that the top of it looked a little nicer the black spongy material on the top looks a little cheap because most of it is covered with the keurig you do not really see much of it anyway so it is not a big deal at all but the material is a bit on the cheaper side still nice though br br additional notes things that were mentioned by previous posters already but that bear repeating br br beware with your keurig on top of it you may not be able to open the top br i was not thinking and failed to read one of the reviews that mentioned this and got this without realizing this duh sure enough i cannot open the top with my keurig on the drawer ooops no biggie though someone commented with a great idea put felt on the bottom of the drawer so that you can easily slide the entire unit out when you need to use your keuirg i plan to do this br br it is much cheaper elsewhere br at the time of this review it is listed on amazon for almost but thanks to a previous reviewer i found it on bed bath and beyond for and i got free shipping too,looks nice is discreet saves space and keeps you organized
11873,looked all over for this great space saver keeps the pods neat water proof top is great for me keeps me from soaking the kcups,good but pricy
11874,pros br this is a fairly simple product a metal drawer with dividers great for organizing all the your k cups less counter space than a carousel br br cons br expensive a metal drawer with dividers for almost it raises your coffee maker about we have a keurig b and when it is placed on this product and shoved back towards the wall it will not open fully to accept the k cup because of the wall cabinets it resides under its not a big deal to just pull the unit forward but i think its definitely worth mentioning,space saver be careful if your coffee maker is under a cabinet
11875,here is the perfect solution for storing k cups until you need them it holds k cups and there is plenty of room for his hers and theirs br br this unit is well built light in weight perfectly functional in design and low enough so you can put your keurig coffee maker on top of it and still put it under your overhead kitchen cabinets,keurig k cup storage drawer
11876,this is so nice to have when space is limited because of the height of our cabinets we were not able to place this under the machine but have it on the side with our other coffee making supplies on top it stores plenty of kcups for easy use much better for us than a stand,perfect for us
11877,this is my second purchase i have so many varieties of tea and coffee that one was not enough space they stack nicely next to my keurig,k cup holder
11878,not only does this store all those annoying little kcups but i put sugar packs and creamers it it too the black top is great because it does not show every little splash of coffee a much better solution that the tree type stands,perfect storage solution
11879,when i originally started looking to buy a keurig it was a deal that came with this drawer i thought it seemed like a great idea immediately i ended up waiting a couple more months before i bought my keurig and it no longer came with the drawer i looked everywhere for the drawer because i liked how it kept the cups hidden from view but still handy like one of the carousels i could not find the drawer it was sold out everywhere i looked for a month i finally found it on amazon and at a good price the drawer has lived up to my expectations i keep my keurig in an area where there are no upper cabinets so i do not have trouble with it being higher now i also alternate k cups facing up and down so i can get more in the drawer i highly recommend this product if you are looking for a way to keep k cups within easy reach organized and hidden,i love this storage drawer
11880,this storage drawer fits in perfectly on our countertop we can either set the keurig on top of it or beside it and still store a large amount of k cups where people can get at them easily totally satisfied,discrete and attractive
11881,saw this at a local big box chain store so of course i had to look for it on amazon as soon as i got home received the item in days prime really rocks does not it and am so happy we can finally get rid of our k cup carousel br br this drawer holds more k cups and keeps them out of sight freeing countertop real estate it glides open smoothly and seems very well made it was shipped in a nice sturdy box and arrived in excellent condition the drawer has divided sections each of which holds k cups perfect for us since we like variety the drawer does not pull completely out but has a built in stop it does not seem to make it harder to get the last k cup out at least for me i am a female with average lady fingers ymmv still i like the stop i would not want to have k cups rolling all over the kitchen floor br br note if you keep your machine under upper cabinets you will likely need to pull it out away from the wall to allow enough clearance to insert k cups and fill the reservoir we just turned our unused kitchen desktop it counter is lower into a coffee station br br my only complaint is that amazon does not carry the t disc version of this drawer so tomorrow it is back to the store to buy one of those got to keep my tassimo machine happy too br br this product is a no brainer,perfect
11882,this is a great idea and a well made product it just seems to me that it was a no brainer to slide the whole thing out from under the cupboard this item is a great space saver,congeneal
11883,until i found this item i was taking up valuable storage space in my overhead cabinet with boxes of k cups i like variety this tray is sturdy holds plenty of k cups and basically disappears from view once you put it under your keurig i love it so much that i ordered one for my cousin we both grew up reciting a place for everything and everything in it is place guess what she loves it too if you are lamenting having bought the carousel simply sell it at your next garage sale and give this tray a try,perfect k cup storage
11884,k cup storage drawer is great i have the carousel but wanted additional k cup storage the drawer fits the bill and takes up no additional space since it sits underneath the keurig brewer no more k cup boxes to hide somewhere,k cup fan
11885,i was originally looking for keurig coffee on amazon and stumbled across this gem i bought it for work to centralize my coffee stuff and it has been perfect k cups stirrers sweetener packets all fit nicely in one place right below my keurig the only thing that would make this product better would be if the dividers in the drawer were solid so stirrers did not have a chance to roll around but since i can tell it was originally designed to only hold k cups i cannot complain great for saving space and looks nicer than the tall spice rack looking k cup holders out there would def recommend,perfect for what i was looking for
11886,i purchased this holder after seeing it in an open house and i just had to have one very well built and engineered the drawer slides very easy and it holds more k cups than i expected overall a great design with no disappointments definitely recommend buying one since it takes up no more space than the coffee maker itself,greatest invention ever
11887,good storage of the k cups as well as enough storage so that it can support my keurig coffee maker it easily solved the problem of how to store all my k cups much better than the rotating tower,great storage
11888,we are neat people and keep our counter clear so this works great for us it is well made slides easily and loads in a minute also cups do not catch sunlight like the vertical racks would in our bright kitchen,simple low profile we like it
11889,such a great little item to have in your cake cookie decorating collection adds great accents silver is probably my most used color because it can be added to so many colors br br highly recommend you check your local michaels or joann amazon usually has competitive prices but these are at your local craft store is wayy overprice on amazon com,probably my most used luster dust
11890,this product is wonderful just apply it with a nice paint brush to almost any creation and watch it sparkle i have had so many ooo and ahhh over my cookies because of the sparkles i add some to the leaves of my royal frosting flowers and they turn out gorgeous as well i cannot wait to try the other colors even though fondant is sick tasting it can look stunning it almost makes me want to eat it almost,absolutely stunning
11891,no obvious taste so perfect for decorating cakes br br highly recommend you check your local michaels or joann amazon usually has competitive prices but these are at your local craft store is wayy overprice on amazon com,so versatile must have for cake decorators
11892,i ordered this for my brother th birthday cake and having never used anything like it before i was a bit clumsy with it there is not much but it goes a long way it covered the chocolate genache great and it looked very cool as did my entire kithen for a week because it gets everywhere proceed with caution in the kitchen,good
11893,while it may not look like much initially i am very satisfied with the amount of shine the silver dust gives with mixed with some vodka and applied on pastillage made quite a difference for the look of a birthday cake i am making item arrived in a timely manner and is well packed,a little silver dusting goes a long way
11894,the silver pearl dust is reasonably easy to use please use a light and careful touch i used this to decorate spritz cookies i used the tree mold and the cookies were lovely and tasty,silver pearl dust
11895,so versatile white pearl can be used to decorate almost anything dust or paint it onto chocolate decorations see whimsical bakehouse book directly onto icing and cookies br br highly recommend you check your local michaels or joann amazon usually has competitive prices but these are at your local craft store is wayy overprice on amazon com,great for cake decorating
11896,the product came in a small vile and i honestly thought that there would not be enough to dust all of the cookies with it to my surprise i ended up making more cookies than originally planned dusted them with the pearl dust and had so much of it left over i was so amazed at how far this stuff goes it gave the cookies such a beautiful finish,beautiful results
11897,i wish i had found this product sooner br so far have only used it on my homemade chocolate truffles and it does add a beautiful almost mysterious bronze luster to them almost hard to believe that it really is edible br very happy with it and would definitely recommend,only discovered this recently bronze powder is truly lustrious and beautiful
11898,when i added this to the cake it was so beautiful that i could not believe it even the customer was impressed it made the cake look more professional for someone who is still learning to make beautiful cakes,silver dust
11899,san marcos is by far the best brand of chipotle in adobo take that wonderful smokey flavor and add it to refried beans and it is a no brainer these are a great medium hot bean,the best chipotle in refried beans how can you go wrong
11900,i have recently started buying erin baker breakfast cookies because they are a fast easy and nutritious way for me to start my day this flavor is not always available as it is a limited edition flavor but fear not these cookies do very well when frozen and can go directly from the freezer to the microwave for about seconds and you have a nice chewy delicious cookie br br this flavor is delicious some of the major ingredients are whole grain rolled oats raisins dried apples walnuts coconut and spices cinnamon nutmeg and carrot cake spices the cookie comes in at calories fiber with g of sugar and iron br br i was doubtful that a large cookie would sustain me as lunch for me is about hours away but i have no problem this cookie is filling and delicious as with any fiber filled product make sure you do drink fluids br br if you do buy these or any of the other breakfast cookies be assured that you can freeze and microwave so on the limited edition flavors you can buy extra if you really love a particular flavor,limited edition flavor that deserves a try
11901,i bought these in mid july with day delivery along with other flavors this is my least favorite i still have the original bunch while i have finished the others and have re ordered them for some reason there is an after taste that i really do not like with this flavor wish i did like it i will keep getting the others through subscribe and save as long as they are available the others are great when i do not want to cook a full breakfast or lunch i do freeze and microwave them then drink a cup of milk with them very filling and satisfying i recommend the other flavors i have tried but not this one i have tried and like the oatmeal and raisin the banana walnut the chocolate chunk and the apple and caramel flavors ymmv,not my favorite
11902,so far i have tried caramel apple fruit nut morning glory and banana walnut flavers i have also ordered but not yet received the pumpkin spice cookies all of them are an excellent meal replacement or nutritious snack the ingredients are wholesome there is no high fructose corn syrup and they have a good supply of protein fiber to stave off hunger for several hours the caramel apple is probably my favorite because it seems to be the moistest but i really love all of the flavors like other reviewers i freeze them and then microwave a cookie for seconds when i am ready to eat it i find the cookies taste best warmed up even though the calorie count is higher than many cookies i think you get a lot of nutritional value with these,erin baker breakfast cookies
11903,i have tried many flavors of erin baker breakfast cookies and until i tried this one i liked them all the ingredients list mentions that they have a touch of carrot cake spice added but it is more than a touch unless you really really love carrot cake you might want to make a different flavor selection my favorite is the chocolate chunk cherry but it appears it is only seasonal i wish i could get it all year long the oatmeal raisin is my second favorite i wish i had ordered them instead of these morning glory,not a good flavor
11904,the cookies at first taste good but it follows up with an interesting after taste it is also a little dry had to down a whole glass of milk but overall it was not too bad,tastes a little dry
11905,erin baker breakfast cookies are an excellent alternative to energy bars and other trail foods they pack well and provide nutritious calories and sustenance they are not gourmet desert cookies they have a lower ratio of sugar and fat and more whole grain carbohydrates they will not taste as good but they will provide energy without a sugar spike or clogging your arteries with saturated fats br br they re still pretty good tasting to me and taste even better during an mile hike,trail food extraordinaire
11906,i decided to give these a try but was a little nervous about the flavor i normally go with chocolate or oatmeal raisin these are great kind of fruity but very good br i think these are perfect for mornings where i do not have time for breakfast and want something i can grab and eat while driving or once i am at the office,good flavor
11907,i ordered these cookies after purchasing some chocolate ones at a local grocer the natural ingredient list is what caught my attention we have enough food products on the market that are over processed and contain so many artificial things that most people cannot even pronounce i ordered the morning glory variety in a trio pack which also contained the oatmeal raisin and the fruit and nut varieties since i had tried the chocolate cookie but was not aware of the other choices i started combing the internet in an attempt to mass order these cookies after seeing the huge variety of cookies available directly from the product maker i took a chance on looking at amazon to compare prices bingo amazon won since the value of the cookies came to a couple of cents more than per cookie i had to place an order everyone who has tasted these cookies have fallen in love with them i highly recommend them to anyone who is looking a wholesome natural snack that you can feel good about eating or serving to guests,not just for breakfast
11908,sue i think you got a bad batch these are awesome i have ordered them three times now and each time they have been soft tasty and easily slide out of the bags i sincerely think you got a bum pack i have tried a couple of other flavors too but prefer this one over the others the cookies are healthy and fast and most of all taste great,these are awesome
11909,years ago on one of the shopping networks on tv quality value and convenience the company was doing bus tours where they discovered entrepreneurs with new and innovative products to sell and they helped them to establish themselves and their products in the marketplace a great service i wish this company would do again br anyway there was one lady entrepreneur whose product happened to be a healthy breakfast cookie such as this br i think perhaps it could have been erin baker i could not verify this br i know at the time i purchased several quantities of this lady cookies do not remember the variety and was very pleased with them br then the product was no longer available i was able to get them for awhile at retail store about miles from me and they were costlier than on tv so stopped purchasing them br time went by and my husband requested an item like this to pack in his lunch box for work as well as my teenage son requesting the same for before school in the mornings br after googling breakfast cookie with thought of making them myself from a recipe i found erin baker on amazon and it was like finding an old friend br still have not made at home my own cookies but i will when time allows br for the time being as long as i can get them on amazon for a decent price i will continue to do so it is nice to have several varieties when available br though i see some of the reviews do not rave about this item as much as i have here personally for what they are i do not hesitate to recommend them and our family enjoys them in moderation,glad i found these
11910,i eat a cookie every morning for breakfast different kinds i do not get hungry until later in the afternoon i have lost pounds in the last month because i am not overeating trash all day i am not saying it is the cookies that are all responsible but i eat the cookie and i am full then can think about what i would like for lunch instead of just eating,deeeeeeee licious
11911,erin baker breakfast cookies are the greatest i ordered morning glory as one of the flavors last time and they are very good my favorite is the banana walnut and i rate them as excellent,goodies for breakfast
11912,there are way too many flavors going on in this breakfast cookie at least for my tastebuds whomever was in charge of adding spices really went too far to the point that it is actually nauseating obviously i will not be ordering this one again,yuck
11913,i eat these cookies frequently using the subscribe method the nutrition provided is high quality br i recommend all the erin cookies for a snack or meal,great nutrition and taste
11914,it is just okay to me this product flavor does not impress me as much as the vegan choc chunk ones offered by erin,nothing great to say
11915,i am surprised by how good this breakfast cookie flavor is it has depth of spices and textures and is truly delicious br br calories seemed a bit high but i ate one with a large glass of water and it has been hours and my tummy is not growling yet i even worked out too br br i love that it does not have any freaky ingredients and it was very soft and moist i gave a little pinch of it to my toddler daughter and she enjoyed it too i prefer to have actual oatmeal in the morning with fruit and yogurt but these breakfast cookies are great if the morning goes sideways and i do not have time or opportunity to fix something br br the problem i found with other protein bars and such is that in about hours i was feeling peckish and looking for snacks until lunch i did not have that problem with this breakfast cookie it may have more calories than i thought i wanted to spend but it is very worth it since it keeps me out of the kitchen until lunchtime br br another nice thing there are not any chips or icing on this cookie to melt in the mid day heat so you can keep one of these in the purse or diaper bag without creating a big mess for yourself later br br i keep them in the freezer for freshness they are really moist and chewy once you let them thaw or microwave i put one on a saucer and nuke for seconds from frozen solid it turns out like its warm from the oven i do not recommend keeping them in the fridge baked goods and bread will get dried out if kept there br br update i have lost pounds in the last year with very minimal changes and these cookies have helped me go from not eating breakfast and snacking all morning to eating breakfast no matter how busy and not needing to snack or eat until lunchtime they are very filling and are perfect for when you do not have time to make anything,wow this tastes great and have lost weight
11916,ironically i am an amazon seasonal worker i discovered these tasty treats while working on the sales floor i kept thinking wow i sure ship alot of these things what are they so i went home and checked them out on line for myself i am a very active and healthy person i am always looking for wholesome breakfast options i have a hard time eating in the am these cookies are so filling and delish i eat one at around am and i am fine until lunch healthy ingredients to fuel your busy day lifestyle i cannot wait to put them in my back pack when i go hiking next,delicious healthy and filling
11917,this is another great breakfasr cookie from erin would definately buy again great to carry when you must skip a meal,breakfast
11918,honestly with the amount of sugar in these they are not much better than eating a calorie regular cookie i do not think these are that healthy the cookies taste fine but i will not repurchase,too sweet
11919,this is one badass cookie i got these on sale at amazon warehouse good deal otherwise it is a good expensive cookie what else can i say grab some,home run cookie
11920,so far have tried two flavors this and oat raisins and prefer the other better this flavor tastes a little bland compared to the other for some reason even though it has more ingredients but it is not inedible or anything just a little bland br br as for whether it helps you feel full i would say it does not for me cause it is just a oz size afterall and i am used to eating a lot more but i always skip breakfast so eating this is better than nothing considering studies show breakfast is the most important meal of the day eating breakfast also helps you lose weight and raise metabolism br br i d give the taste stars but bought it for amazing cents each cookie so price gets stars which avg out to stars,taste stars price stars so stars
11921,i enjoy several varieties of the erin baker breakfast cookies banana nut pumpkin spice but this is my favorite not too sweet for my taste very satisfying and filling i heat in microwave for about seconds and good to go great with coffee or tea i keep them in the freezer as they recommend you must do this as they can get mold otherwise and they always taste fresh and fine to me they are wrapped packaged very nicely for the freezer also good in the toaster crispy crust br br these are one of my favorite quick breakfasts on hurried mornings and sometimes i even enjoy them on a relaxed sunday morning i buy these regularly and quality has remained consistently good i recommend these highly,delicious and satisfying my favorite flavor in their line
11922,the breakfast cookie is excellent my grandson came back from a scouting trip and said it was better than the energy bars they were given to eat nice blend for any time of day i pop mine from the freezer into the microwave for about seconds taste best warm,cookies are great anytime
11923,i knew before buying that the ingredients were not all that wholesome evaporated cane juice enriched wheat flour what are those doing in a breakfast if a product is claiming to be a healthy breakfast it should really have unadulterated ingredients i ll give the erin baker brand its due for using aluminum free baking powder all that having been said if you regard this as a cookie rather than a meal replacement you will be happy with it it is healthy for a cookie tastes decent and fantastically convenient take it out of the freezer in the morning and it is good to go in hours without heating but despite what other reviewers have said it is a high calorie snack at best i am a lb female and this barely held me over for about and a half hours before i was starving again if you are someone with a small appetite try packing it with a piece of fruit bottom line it is a healthy cookie not breakfast much less a healthy breakfast,convenient food but it is really a cookie not a meal replacement
11924,slightly biased because this company was started near my hometown but i have been a fan of erin baker breakfast cookies for years since i first noticed them popping up at coffee shops back home now living on the other side of the country i was pleasantly surprised to find them on amazon and even more excited to find them at such a great price store them in the freezer pop them in the toaster and it is like eating a fresh baked cookie that is full of good things for you and keeps you from getting hungry till lunch high in fiber and much better tasting than any energy bar out there who does not love a cookie for breakfast i love these things will be ordering more soon to keep our freezer well stocked,great option for a quick healthy filling breakfast on the go
11925,erin cookies are the awesome great for an on the run family when there is no time for a longer breakfast i keep them on hand at all times for my kids so they can grab one when they go out the door to school or work i even keep two in my car console for those moments when i need some fast nutrition while driving tasty good for you and quick as an active family what more could we want,the best
11926,these are very good i like several of the flavors of these cookie and usually have one a few times per week very convenient to eat in the car while taking my daughter to school product is wholesome too so you can feel good about eating them i order frequently and hope amazon continues to carry them,morning glory breakfast cookies
11927,the three ounce breakfast cookies are a small meal in a cookie and the individually wrapped cookies are easy to keep in a desk drawer or to carry in a back pack or briefcase they are good for people on the go and have reasonably balanced nutrition grams of protein grams of fiber grams of fat they are listed as having calories they have an expiration date noted on the wrapper i have tried many different flavors over many years and have never found a flavor i did not like the listing of ingredients is in white lettering on an orange background on the wrapper and is almost impossible to read but the ingredients can be obtained from the web page the morning glory cookies have a good combination it is worth sampling the different cookie flavors and you will undoubtedly have favorites,good quick meal
11928,this made an excellent mother day gift my mom with discriminating taste is truly enjoying them they have just the right amount of small sweetness for breakfast and a flavor she likes the packaging makes them good for a mail order gift,good eating
11929,i first purchased erin baker breakfast cookie in the caramel apple flavor while it was tasty and very fulfilling i was not forsure if i was in love with them and really why waste your time eating something you do not love so based on customer reviews i then tried the morning glory breakfast cookie i loved the bits of nut and i have to say it is tasty and fulfilling it is my nd favorite cookie and i easily give them a star rating br br i again began browsing the cookie flavors and spent time reading customer reviews and decided to try the peanut butter chocolate chunk and all i can say is third times the charm these breakfast cookies are knock your socks off delicious i plan on stocking up so that i do not have to order over the hot summer months as i have read on some of the cookie reviews that because these cookies are so fresh and have no preservatives to prevent spoilage that they are prone to mold if left out to long so i figure why take the chance i am just going to make several purchases before summer gets here br br i totally recommend these breakfast cookies my only wish is that they came in a variety box so one is not forced to purchase a whole pack to sample one flavor yes they are a little high calorie so you might not want to use them as a snack but for a meal replacement they are fantastic i love the natural ingredients and i know these cookies are fresh makes you wonder how fresh those meal replacement bars are that sit on the store shelf for months,great taste
11930,super good cookie for breakfast they surprisingly fill me up for a couple of hours which for me is wonderful i insist on eating as soon as i wake up in the morning and this is a great way to get some whole grains and healthy stuff on the run br br perishable which makes me happy so do not stock up unless you have room in the freezer i keep mine in the refrigerator and so far no problems br br my son likes them too,outstanding and filling
11931,i love erin breakfast cookies but this flavor is a little to rich for me it gives me that funny feeling in the back of my throat,not my favorite flavor
11932,this is my first erin baker breakfast cookie experience i put all the cookies in the freezer upon arrival i followed the supplied helpful hint to toast the cookies on the darkest setting memories of my grandmother winter cookies warm from the oven commenced tasty toasty outside and warm soft inside these are yummy with a tall glass of the coldest milk or a hot coffee to go i would buy these again,morning glory yummy
11933,these cookies are tasty but just a little too gooey and the calorie count is for one cookie this is a bit high,good taste high calorie
11934,these are not grandma cookies but tasty enough when eating healthy is what you try to do,good quick snack or breakfast
11935,i was so excited to try these i am trying to find economical good for you food i ate one of these and a cup of joe and i was full delicious heated it seconds that of course is unfrozen i immediately froze the rest to keep them fresh as no preservatives in them i think you have to heat it about seconds when frozen my son had one he is and he had to have two to fill him he likes them a lot my mom had one and she was full she could not quit talking about how good they are another reason i also wanted to try these is because my mom has alzheimers and cannot cook on stove safely anymore she likes to snack and get things herself so these are perfect she can still use the microwave i feel these are healthy eating and that makes me feel good we all have medical disabilities so the easier the better the really cool part is that they are just a little over a each for breakfast we love the morning glory and am fixing to order more with amazon prime by the way for those of you who do not know about prime it is wonderful and we have saved so much on shipping this year also it is quick day free shipping and for overnight i try to only buy products that have prime on them our cookies came today a saturday with prime day by fed ex that is another thing i love is shipping is free with prime on these if you shop a lot on amazon which i am doing more and more the is a great value for a years membership gotta order more cookies now blessings br br update i have read comments that some people had these get mould on them please remember to freeze these as they have no preservatives there is a note on white paper from erin baker in each package which suggests you do this and why just hate to see erin get bashed for this when it is not her fault mine go in the freezer as soon as they arrive that way they are always fresh still love these cookies br br i am now on monthly automatic mailing so we have them even if i forget to order on time that way it is even less expensive how can you go wrong great bargain for those of us who have to watch our pennies br br my mom who has alzheimers loves them so much i hate to think what would happen if i quit ordering them she talks about them all the time she was feeling so down as she cannot cook much at all anymore and since these they are easy for her to heat in the microwave it makes her feel better about herself thank you erin,first time buy and we love them
11936,another great product delicious and nutritious it makes you feel guilty that you are eating something that is actually good and good for you,erin baker morning glory cookie
11937,i purchased these with high hopes because i do not seem to have enough time to eat a great breakfast but i thought this would provide sustenance til lunchtime however i was disappointed after a few bites while the cookie is wholesome and filling it does have a slight aftertaste to me it seemed like something was missing not sure what since there are many good ingredients but i think i would have enjoyed apple cinnamon much better br br also i also found it disturbing that even though my cookies were not frozen probably should have done this since they are a moist cookie and not yet expired january they were stored on the pantry shelf as they are individually wrapped but they became moldy yep i just threw away three cookies because i could see mold through the package opened one to confirm it yuck,uh it is just okay
11938,very good flavor and texture excellent wholesome snack one of the best all natural oatmeal cookies i have ever tried plus all natural ingredients,excellent cookies
11939,i especially like the chocolate cookie but failed to freeze my cookies on the third day i had three molded cookies word of advice put in the freezer within the first day or two,freeze immediately
11940,breakfast is often a hard meal to fit in and this is a great way to get the fuel that you need in this important meal tasty even better after seconds in a microwave we are about to reorder these are a hit,super value
11941,gave erin baker breakfast morning glory cookies as a gift and the recipient gave the cookies very high reviews thank you,the best breakfast cookies
11942,i love the mix of flavors in this cookie the cookies are very moist and they are also very filling the only thing i did not like about these is the strong nutmeg taste unfortunately nutmeg is not my favorite spice i would have enjoyed more raisins but my kids are glad there are not that many i love the fact that i can keep these handy for mornings when we are running late and for when we take trips they are easy to freeze and seem to keep rather well in the freezer,a great combo of flavors
11943,i love this breakfast cookie i usually have this with fruit and tea or juice for a quick breakfast or sometimes i have it with vanilla ice cream for dessert,breakfast on the go
11944,i love these cookies they are just perfect for an on the go breakfast bite paired with a piece of fruit,yummy
11945,these cookies have good taste ar a great quick breakfast and are healthy i will have one with a cup of coffee and i am good for the morning,good quick breakfast
11946,if i had not scored these during a warehouse sell off i would even more seriously fail to understand how or why anyone could justify paying over a dollar a piece for these things sure the instructions are dead on with the freeze before toasting method but they have more ingredients than healthy cookies i can make at home for much cheaper and with superior texture and without the garbage if you think these are healthy or a good value you have been duped,even the i spent on these was a mistake
11947,i really wanted to like these but i just found them to be to sweet sugary br i generally stay away from cliff bars for the same reason and had hoped that these would be as good as they sound br br sadly its just to sweet tasting for me br br special note the packs i received oct have g sugar not the g listed in the amazon nutrition section br there may have been a recipe change,to sweet wrong nutrition info
11948,the cookies tasted too much like baby food prunes to be any good also they included directions to freeze them when they arrived to keep them from spoiling i would never buy these again,yucky taste
11949,not kosher ignore the symbol they are not kosher and not certified by any company i contacted the company to confirm,not kosher
11950,we picked these up based on the glowing reviews my fault my mistake i believe they are way over rated does not taste morning glory at all instead tastes just like any one of the other in the line dry stale dense oatmeal cookie like a cookie experiment gone bad by a pre teen br br in addition cookies arrived cracked broken and sticking to bag yet are dry stale inside what a waste i would have never purchased these in a b m store had i had an opportunity to examine them first,bought based on reviews no more
11951,the breakfast cookie is not to my liking and i do not think i will order them in the future,not so good
11952,after purchasing a href http www amazon com gp product b viwuhg kopali goldenberries a i tried a few other kopali snacks a href http www amazon com gp product b vircz chocolate covered cacao nibs a and a href http www amazon com gp product b viwute chocolate covered banana a br br the goldenberries are the best dried fruit i have ever had they are bursts of sweet and tangy flavor and achieve the same satisfaction as sour gummies grown in columbia goldenberries are high in antioxidants bioflavonoids fiber and even contain protein they are a great snack and are somewhat filling br br the dark chocolate covered nibs are also good the small package contains a lot more nibs than it seems at first the nibs are crunchy high in antioxidants and a little bit bitter but the dark chocolate balances the bitterness nicely br br the chocolate covered bananas were also delicious i expected them to be crispy but instead they were chewy and a bit zesty each of the kopali organics products is a healthy and satisfying snack you should try them especially the goldenberries,i love kopali products
11953,if it was not for me standing in the checkout line at whole foods i would have never even noticed the bag i decided to try it out and omg they are the best i love that the chocolate is not an overwhelming sweetness but just enough to compliment the dried bananas i honestly cannot wait to get my hands on another bag the only disappointment that i have is that you cannot buy them at every whole foods,i am so hooked on these
11954,kopali chocolate covered bananas are amazing the bananas are naturally sun dried so they are chewy which makes them different from most chocolate covered bananas and the chocolate is vegan gluten free and fair trade i could not ask for anything more in a food product i also love putting these on top of vanilla ice cream as a nice alternative to more unhealthy toppings nice work kopali,two delicious foods originally combined
11955,love these buy them at whole foods all the time healthy pure organic and fair trade dark chocolate with yummy banana all the chocolates and fruits are good but these are my favorite helping the environment and small farmers all over the world too a href http www amazon com gp product b viwute kopali organics organic chocolate covered dried banana ounce pouch pack of a,delicious
11956,this is the best snack on the planet every little molecule of this item is vibrating with the love that comes from growing harvesting making and distributing it in harmony with nature it is soooo good people think that just because it costs a little more than a bag of monocultured corn chips it is expensive but in terms of the taste of the nutrition of the total value it is not expensive it is not cheap but nothing green is or should be,da bomb
11957,these bite sized banana pieces are delicious they are covered in dark chocolate and are chewy the bananas are not fried or crispy and banana chips typically are these chocolate covered bananas are vegan organic and fair trade and while they are a bit pricey the bags are small and will not last too long because these are delicious they are a unique treat which makes it worth purchasing these are not too sweet they have a hint of sweetness from the chocolate and banana but are a tad bitter from the dark chocolate,great treat not too sweet
11958,i love kopali stuff great little snacks that are always fresh when i buy em and good for the earth save the planet thanks kopali br br a href http www amazon com gp product b viwute kopali organics organic chocolate covered dried banana ounce pouch pack of a a href http www amazon com gp product b viwv kopali organics organic chocolate covered mulberries ounce pouch pack of a,yummy and good for the earth
11959,i was disappointed by my first taste of kopali organics chocolate covered dried banana the chocolate is waxy and the bananas too soft for me i was expecting more crunch a drier banana the banana did not taste of banana to me either i will not purchase again,choc covered banana snack
11960,it clearly states on the description pack of but i only got and i cannot find how to complain about this i do not want to return,only got packs
11961,i bought these walnuts hoping they would have a fresh natural taste better than the packaged nuts i find at my local grocery unfortunately the nuts i received had somehow absorbed a strong taste of plastic i took them out of the plastic tubs they were packed in and put them in another container i use that does not transfer odors or tastes onto the food even so after several weeks these nuts still tasted very unpleasantly of plastic,taste like plastic
11962,i do not buy my walnuts anywhere else these taste great and are a fantastic price i put most of them in the freezer and pull them out as i need them in order to ensure they stay fresh since tubs lasts me quite a while,great product at a great price
11963,i purchased this product from otto because the offering via amazon prime was out of stock otto shipped me four plain tubs without terrafina labels and sealed with a vertical x of clear packing tape rather than terrafina vacuum seal where the tub and the cover meet i called otto within a few days of receipt and they said they buy in bulk from terrafina and package it themselves they said they were out of terrafina labels two of the tubs developed mold within a few days of my call to otto and i had to throw all of them out i am now seeking a refund from amazon,not a genuine terrafina product
11964,i get these nuts for my church sister who does not have a computer she actually eats them every day which is included in her diet,gone nuts
11965,i think depeche mode said it the best i just cannot get enough and that is how i feel about these crackers they have a wonderful flavor and are low in fat and calories a serving size is crackers these are a great alternative to basic potato chips macaroni salad and or french fries great by themselves with dip or along your favorite sandwich once you open a package you will be amazed how long before you are opening another,you cannot eat just one package
11966,great flavor and love the snap when your looking for something crunchy that is not high in calories a litle high in carbs though these are amazing and you can have crackers in a serving i was buying them at an natural health food store for a package a much better deal for a case here on amazon about less per package,love the flavor and crunch
11967,sesmark makes a very high quality rice cracker and then proceeds to ruin it by loading it up with so much salt as to make it inedible use caution before buying this item since there are no returns and you might find yourself with a throw away,too much salt
11968,my entire family loves these crackers great with cheese delicious alone too,yummy
11969,these crackers are great too again especialy for people who cannot tolerate wheat others like them too they stay crunchy you save money buying by the case,sesmark sesame rice thins
11970,these crackers are very addictive the flavor is superb and the crunch is great,best crackers ever
11971,these are great crackers they have a great crunch when you bite into them and they are loaded with a wonderful toasted sesame flavor my husband has diabetes and we went out looking for snacks for him to eat these have no trans fat and crackers is one serving if you need to watch your intake of fat and calories for whatever reason you know how hard it is to find snacks that are satisfying and these are just great,a great snack cracker
11972,if you are gluten free and want crackers this is the one for you it is also delicious this is my second order of these,a cracker of a cracker
11973,and that is part of the problem no really i can eat just a few maybe more later br these thins are not quite as thin as i would prefer nor am i but make a good snack for hors d oeuvres if you top them with anything moist do a few at a time they get soggy pretty fast,bet you cannot eat just one
11974,i buy these crackers because i need something gluten free to snack with but why does gluten free have to be so salty i have to wipe the salt off to be able to eat them wish the manufacturers would learn that just because we are glten free does not mean we can eat all that salt less salt please,like them but too salty
11975,i like these sesame rice thins because they are just the thing i need to fill between meals especially with a bit of cheese philly cheese tasty spread and other great to have separated packages because i go through one so quickly and my husband loves to munch on these all the time i recommend these to anyone who wants a different type of snack for a party or just for one self,great for a snack
11976,these are great seriously they kind of remind me of corn nuts they are crunchy light a tiny bit salty and totally tasty i just got them today and cannot stop eating them i very much suggest getting these pretty good price and so much better than the rice crackers at my local store,delicious
11977,sesame rice thins are the best tasting rice crackers i have tried and i have tried several they stay crispy and crunchy and come in several flavors you will not be disappointed amazon has the best price too,dlicious
11978,the product is a known value to us and is fresh the physical condition of the product leaves something to be desired the individual wafers are often broken up to the extent of of the contents of the package this indicates careless packing for the rigors of package shipment the use of a somewhat larger outside box with the air bag padding on all sides should be better for the physical care of the contents my wife eats the thins for lunch very often with meat cheese or fish and finds the broken ones unsatisfactory,sesmark sesame rice thins
11979,these are my favorite gluten free crackers and they come in many flavors i have tried and liked most of them,gluten free crackers
11980,crispy with the light flavor of rice and sesame lightly salted i love these crackers,delicious
11981,as good as any in grocery stores and more reasonably priced but you do have to get a carton of them,excellent rice crackers
11982,i have to eat a gluten free diet and these crackers are the best i have come across i eat them with cheese or hummus very good,awesome wheat free alternative to crackers
11983,there is no other brand is comparable to this brand whoever i gave the crackers to would become addicted i keep order them over and over again,the only crackers
11984,i ordered cases as always rvc d the cases and the crackers were saltless tastless amazon was kind to send more cases and they were the same blah i have written the masnufacturer to let them know br amazon has greta customer care,mfr skimpin on ingredients
11985,the bamboo arrived about weeks after ordering all intact and well packed however there were no instructions for caring of the bamboo it is now almost a month since arriving and part of the bamboo stalk looks like it is dying and turning brown part of the heart shape i would buy more from this company if the shipping was not so costly for the area where i live the shipping was about and the product itself,heart shaped lucky bamboo
11986,i added this to my order since i was going to be paying shipping charges anyway i did not expect anything unusual there probably are as many jerk recipes as there are residents in jamaica but this one surprised me pleasantly it was not full of sugar and added a really pleasant note to everything i cooked with it i will be buying it again,sugarless jerk seasoning
11987,when chatchi favorite afternoon treat became mysteriously unavailable in the vending machine at work chatchi panicked how would chatchi get through the work day without his chuckles the delicious fat free candy that provides you with the sweet filled enjoyment you earn every day br br fortunately amazon carries this delicious chewy fruity candy and chatchi can get back to doing his job br br chatchi only complaint about chuckles is the black licorice flavor chatchi normally likes black licorice but this flavor is so overpowering chatchi needs to eat it last so as not to ruin the remaining cherry orange lemon and lime flavors br br chatchi loves chuckles,the fruits of my labor
11988,when i was young nearly a half century ago chuckles was a very popular candy i really enjoyed eating these jellied treats which were dusted with granulated sugar as they definitely satisfied a sweet tooth i still enjoy them on occasion though they are not as easy to find as in the old days having waned somewhat in popularity my particular favorite was the cherry flavor if they had sold an all cherry pack i would have bought them by the ton luckily for me an all cherry pack was not available i also enjoyed the licorice and orange flavors lemon and lime however were the flavors that i liked least so i would benevolently offer them to my younger sisters i was all heart in those days,an old fashioned candy
11989,you are crazy if you do not have a soft spot for chuckles you know darn well that they were one of your favorites as a kid and you cannot resist a package or two even today i love the cherry flavored and wish that they would introduce a red only package of chuckles if only for a limited edition and boy would i hold on to a few of those for posterity a tip for you chuckles lovers freeze em they last a lot longer that way and are well complimented by your favorite non caloric beverage we ladies need to watch our expanding figures unless the stork is on the way god bless chuckles,old fashioned classic
11990,i looked around a lot for a non water drink to have on a diet and it was a long gross search this really fit the bill though good taste very light and did not taste fake at all br br my advice though is per packet disregard their instructions use an entire pitcher of water for one packet or it is just way too potent,nice on a diet
11991,these bars are great however this item can be purchased for at sams club same box,so good
11992,these taste terrific and my grandkids call them candy bars and consider them a special treat they prefer the chocolate chip i love the dark chocolate almond,great for kids
11993,super bubble is my very favorite gum and very hard to find here the box i received was a real hit or miss more than half the gum was brick hard totally unchewable i have never run across this issue with this product and am very disappointed i will take a chance and buy it again sometime in the future but this particular purchase left a bad taste in my mouth,hit or miss
11994,for the longest time they would not ship this to apos i do not know why maybe they were afraid the yummy super bubble gum would fall into the hands of the enemy get flavor and one piece works i chew gum every day in the gym because i grind my teeth when lifting helps alot,finally
11995,i have purchaesed twice so far and in both boxes the gum was really hard product is great but i would not purchase again through amazon due to it being so hard to chew,super bubble is great but box from amazon not that great
11996,i am addicted to super bubble bubble gum i ordered four boxes and was very pleased with the promptness packaging and product,prompt service fresh and delicious product
11997,simply the best dates i have ever had all natural no preservatives or sugars surprised some dates have added sugars i stopped buying any other dates once i discovered those,the best dates i ever had
11998,i ordered this saffron after looking at seller feedback and assumed that since this is expensive it will be premium quality br but only after i put it in water for sometime then the color of the flakes changed and i realized that its a fake one br dont waste your time on this,fake saffron
11999,i ordered this product because i love pasta but need to start modifying my diet because i want to start fighting competitively again and need to get myself back to peak performance i was skeptical from all the talk of fishy smell and taste thus being the reason i ordered the single pack i prepared them as instructed and prepared them into a soup i used chicken breasts cut into strips boiled them into a broth with sliced carrots green onions and broccoli and then poured it into the bowl over the noodles me and my girlfriend tried it and it turned out great she put some soy sauce in hers because she liked it better that way but we both loved it it did not have the fish smell after rinsing nor while eating it the texture is comparable to the rice noodles you find in vietnamese and japanese dishes i am a convert to miracle noodle i fed two people off of one pack not bad i say also noticed the difference in the curving of my snack urges didn t even touch my yogurt orange or nature valley peanut butter bar until near the end of my shift at work and could wait longer before i took my lunch at work i work hour night shifts so that is why i ate this before work these are a great tool into any nutrition plan in my book,great product and no problems with delivery
